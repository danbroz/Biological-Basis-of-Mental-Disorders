      "abstract": "People who display features of this personality style have an enduring tendency to blame themselves when anything goes wrong. They also tend to be self-critical and demanding on themselves to an irrational extent. Although they may prefer it when others take control of tasks, they are still likely to berate themselves for one or another aspect of the job. People with features of the self-critical personality style do not expect the high level of perfection that perfectionists demand of themselves and of others. Rather, they are more likely to believe that others will perform much better than they would at the same tasks. They may regularly seek reassurance from others about their own performance but such reassurance may be short-lived or only last until the next task. They often have a developmental history of uncaring and/or abusive parenting and other deprivational experiences.",

      "abstract": "codependency, emergency medicine: codependency, emergency medicineFigureWe all know that feeling. Sometimes it starts during your shift, at times it creeps up on your way home, at other times it wells up uninvited just before your shift. It overwhelms you, consumes you. Sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly and brutally. Sometimes it doesn't let go. It is uncomfortable enough to make you want to run. But you can't. It's too busy—stretchers out the door (again). You need to focus; everyone depends on you. It feels like too much to bear. And tomorrow you do it all over again (if only you could get some sleep). You used to love your job. Now you secretly (or not so secretly) resent it. But you don't really have a choice. Or do you? Codependency means sharing a dependency without actually partaking in it with a person caught up in some dependency of his own (alcohol, money, workload, etc.) who, as a result of your or his codependency, has become dependent on you. It is a negative relationship, hard to recognize, and difficult to escape. Codependency was first described by Melody Beattie in Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself. As a recovering alcoholic, she became entangled with alcoholics before recognizing her codependency. Her book is not aimed at alcoholics but at codependents—those of us hanging onto destructive relationships even if we are intensely unhappy. Codependents often feel responsible for others. They say yes when they mean no, tell themselves what they want and need is not important, and feel safest when giving (and insecure or guilty when receiving). They also overcommit themselves (and blame others for it), abandon their task to respond to others (then wonder why others don't do the same for them), and feel deserted by others, victimized, underappreciated, and controlled by people or situations. They tend to pretend circumstances are not as bad as they are. Codependents desperately seek approval or validation (often from people or situations incapable of giving it). They get angry, defensive, indignant, or self-righteous when criticized, and wonder why they never have energy and can't get things done. They also don't feel quite good enough (and try to prove they are), and don't feel happy, content, or peaceful with themselves. My Twitter feed is filled with examples of codependency, especially within emergency medicine. I know most of you have seen tweets describing uncomfortable workplace situations that embody three distinct personas: The victim (“why me?”), the rescuer (“I saved the day”), and the persecutor (“not like that, idiot”). Sometimes a tweeter draws from multiple personas, but most prefer one of the three, often the victim. These personas were described nearly 50 years ago by Stephen Karpman, MD, who arranged them in an inverted triangle called the drama triangle, not because of the associated inevitable drama, but because he saw these as roles acted out during conflict. We choose to act the role of a victim, a rescuer, or a persecutor when faced with conflict. Everyone is a Victim Dr. Karpman recognized that a person eventually ends up as a victim if the conflict persists even if he initially reacts as a rescuer or persecutor. It is inevitable that each of us will engage with the triangle when faced with a sustained stressful situation. Codependency, for instance. Consider this: Is it really that busy when you come to work, or is it always busy? Will a shop that has gone to the dogs really go to the dogs even more if you go home on time, take a deserved break, or stay at home when ill? Will calmness be restored after you've sorted out those incompetent specialists? Most likely not. We become codependents of the service we provide. It needs us, or so we tell ourselves, even though it frequently affects the rest of our lives so negatively. It is probably one of the biggest reasons we struggle to be kind to one another and consider leaving emergency medicine, even if our co-workers think we are amazing for always being there. Codependency is not a nice place, and moving on is very, very difficult. The first step to solving any problem is admitting there is one, but a codependent's nature is not to admit to being the one with the problem. Many of us have become such good codependents that we cannot differentiate our role from reality: “Surely, the problem must lie with the dependent person or service?” It doesn't. The short explanation is we are not responsible for the dependency of another, only ourselves. If we live a lie long enough, it becomes our reality. Escaping codependency is fairly simple once you have acknowledged it. You have to break with your preferred acquired conflict persona and replace it with the more grounded roles of the survivor, coach, or challenger, moving away from the actor you and toward the true you, from making time to care for others to making time for yourself. Inability to achieve this sadly means you'll just take your conflict act with you wherever you go. It is a glorious day when you realize that the most important place from which to engage with any relationship is from within. Only outside of codependency can we be awesome physicians while also becoming healthier in other aspects of our lives. I recommend reading Ms. Beattie's book on codependency. Start your journey there. Two other great books are The Power of Ted: The Empowerment Dynamic and How to Break Free of the Drama Triangle & Victim Consciousness. I use the Stop, Breathe & Think app to help me focus during conflict situations, to check in with or center myself daily, and to reflect on codependency whenever it crops up. (https://www.stopbreathethink.com.) It consists of short meditations (3-10 minutes), and is much healthier than stepping out for a cigarette, ranting in front of staff and patients, or worse, repressing it. I am not a psychologist, and do not pretend to be one. But I am a recovering codependent, and I wanted to share what I learned about codependency, emergency medicine, and life.

      "abstract": "Kesepian dirasakan oleh mereka yang sedang ditinggalkan anggota keluarga yang hepergian atau sedang ditugaskan ke tuar kota untuk sementara sehingga terpisah dari teman-teman dan keluarga. Sampai taraf tertentu kesepian adalah hat yang wajar. Tetapi jika rasa sepi ini mulai mengganggu seseorang maka kesepian sudah menjadi masalah baginya. Orang yang kesepian adalah orang yang membutuhkan orang lain untuk melakukan relasi-relasi tertentu entah sebagai teman, kenalan, tempat pencurahan kasih sayang atau sebagai kekasih. Mereka membutuhkan orang lain clan memang hubungan yang baik membutuhkan komunikasi serta sikap saling percaya. Hubungan seperti ini memberikan dua keuntungan yaitu : orang dapat mengetahui nilai-nilai yang sebenarnya ia miliki serta menjadi sadar akan hal apa yang sedang menimpanya. Kesepian timbul karena dua hat ini tidak ada sehingga orang merasa dirinya tidak bernilai. Kesepian tidak sama dengan `menarik diri dengan sengaja' (voluntary withdrawl) dimana orang yang membutuhkan kesunyian seperti untuk mengarang buku atau menyelesaikan skripsi. Disini tidak terjadi kesepian karena orang justru dengan sengaja melepaskan diri dari suatu hubungan mutualistik dengan orang lain untuk tujuan-tujuan tertentu. Kesepian yang negatip sebagian besar disebabkan oleh sikap orang yang negatip yaitu merasa diri tidak bernilai dihadapan orang lain atau karena sikap orang lain yang tidak menghargainya; ternyata sangat mengganggu perasaannya.",

      "abstract": "Human lives can go wrong in a variety of ways and from different causes: as a result of malnutrition, illness, injury, or untimely death, from the malice, envy, or insensitivity of others, because of lack of self-knowledge or excess of self-doubt – the list is a long one. I want to focus on lives that go wrong on account of misdirected or frustrated desire. These too can be of different kinds. Someone who had set her heart on just one thing – athletic success, fame as a celebrity, preeminence as a physicist – and fails to achieve it may thereafter lead the unhappy life of a disappointed woman. Someone who wants too many different things and is recurrently diverted from his pursuit of this by the attractions of that may suddenly find that he has squandered his life away without achieving very much. Someone who wants and aspires to too little, perhaps from fear of the pain of disappointment, may never recognize that their talents and skills have never been put to adequate use. Such examples make it clear that when lives go wrong in these various ways, frustrated or misdirected or inadequate desire has played a part, even if not the only part, in making them go wrong.",

      "title": "Someone To Talk To",
      "abstract": "When people are facing difficulties, they often feel the need for a confidant—a person to vent to or talk things through with who will offer sympathy or understanding. How do they decide on whom to rely? In theory, the answer seems obvious: if the matter is personal, they will turn to a spouse, a family member, or someone otherwise close. In practice, what people actually do often belies these expectations. This book follows a group of graduate students as they cope with the stress of their first year in their programs, probing how they choose confidants over the course of their everyday experiences and unraveling the implications of the process. The book then tests its explanations against data on national populations. It shows that rather than consistently rely on their “strong ties,” people often take pains to avoid close friends and family, because these are too fraught with complex expectations. People often confide in “weak ties,” as their fear that their trust could be misplaced is overcome by their need for one who understands. In fact, people may find themselves confiding in acquaintances and even strangers unexpectedly, without much reflection on the consequences. Amid a growing wave of big data and large-scale network analysis, the book returns to the basic questions of who we connect with, how, and why, and upends decades of conventional wisdom on how we should think about and analyze social networks.",

      "title": "burnout: a multimodal approach to assessment and resolution",
      "abstract": "Burnout - that which once shone so brightly no more illuminates the world around it. And the shadows cast by the dimming are long and deep and dark. Where once there was enthusiasm, conviction, and compassion for helping others, only frustration, apathy, and terrible loneliness remain. Paradoxically, the need to reach out and help is still there, but it is mired in a personal sense of reduced motivation, low energy, and an overwhelming sense of futility and fraud. As helping professionals, guidance counselors are especially susceptible and well situated by their role expectations and responsibilities to suffer the signs and consequences of burnout. In fact, for school guidance counselors at risk, the literature describes symptomatology affecting every facet of their personal and professional lives, as the following definition reveals: Burnout can be defined as a reduced sense of personal accomplishment, wherein the individual blames himself - not the circumstances - for his feelings, emotional and physical exhaustion, occupational fatigue, cynical attitudes, depersonalization toward or withdrawal from clients, chronic depression and/or increased anxiety (Rando, 1984); interpersonal conflicts and strained work relationships, low morale and productivity, physical complaints, and a strong tendency toward substance abuse (Maynard, 1986). A conceptual device that promises to clarify the many symptoms and consequences of burnout is Lazarus's BASIC I.D. (1976), which stands for Behavior, Affect, Sensation, Imagery, Cognition, Interpersonal Relationships, and Drugs/Biology. The crux of this framework is that human beings are multidimensional in their experience of life. They function on many levels that overlap; emotions affect thought, images affect behavior, sensations affect physical health, and so forth. Lazarus applied this ripple effect to the assessment and treatment of dysfunctions and thereby developed a flexible and easily managed way to give comprehensive care.",

      "abstract": "One of the main sources of psychological discomfort in people is caused by business, which appear when a person feels hurt, angry, or resentful of another person and can't find a way to resolve these feelings. As a result, the experience is incomplete. Withholding the incomplete experience or avoiding closure a person invests a large part of their energy, which makes them low energy available to deal with new situations.\r\nUnfinished affairs are basically the product of past situations or unresolved unresolved untrapsiquical conflicts. Some manifestations of unfinished situations are resentment or anger not expressed to parents, siblings, partners, and other significant people. Moreover, unfinished affairs are a consequence of uninterated love, unresolved guilt, uncons accepted past actions, etc. Non-resolution can involve other people or some aspects of yourself. When people do not act properly to make a closure, when they cannot forget the actions that have occurred in the past, or when they do not accept situations as they are, then they are unable to function in a healthy and energetic way. I remember once seeing in psychotherapy a young woman who had applied to be admitted to a university. When her admission was denied, she entered a deep depression. Psychotherapy found that her emotional reaction was based on the belief that if she failed she did not deserve to be loved. In her childhood, this young woman, the only times she received shows of affection from her father was when she got good school grades and now, by not getting into college, she felt that the same thing that happened to her father would happen to her with other men: no man could love her. That's where his desperation came from. The intensity of his emotion was provoked by unresolved feelings toward his father.",

      "title": "The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life",
      "abstract": "Human beings have the ability to be self reflective, or to think consciously about themselves, which allows them, among other things, to imagine themselves in the future, anticipate the consequences of their behaviour, plan ahead, and take steps to improve themselves. Despite these obvious advantages, self-reflection comes at a high price. Most people occasionally realize that it causes problems, such as when they cannot stop dwelling on some past failure or future worry, when their ego fuels conflicts with other people, or when their mental chatter keeps them awake at night. Yet few people realize neither how profoundly their lives are affected by their self-reflection, nor how frequently this inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships with others, and undermines their happiness. The mental apparatus that enables us to be self-reflective is the same one responsible for most of the personal and social difficulties we face as individuals and as a species. The egocentric, egotistical self blinds people to their own shortcomings, undermines their relationships with others, and leads to social conflict.Self-reflection distorts peoples perceptions of the world, leading them to make bad decisions based on faulty information. By allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine what might happen in the future, it also conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, jealousy, and other negative emotions. A great deal of unhappiness, in the form of addictions, overeating, and domestic violence, is due to peoples inability to exert control over their thoughts and behaviour. This lack of control has led visionaries throughout history to proclaim that the egoic self stymies our quest for spiritual fulfilment and leads to immoral behaviour. Is it possible to direct our self reflection in a way that will minimize the disadvantages and maximize the advantages? Is there a way to affect the egotistical self through self-reflection? In this volume Mark Leary explores the personal and social problems that are created by the capacity for self-reflection, and by drawing upon psychology and other behavioural sciences, offers insights into how these problems can be minimized.",

      "title": "Hope's Relation with Self-Esteem, Optimism, and Life Satisfaction in Engineering Students",
      "abstract": "Everyone in this competitive world is trying to become more successful in his/her life. In this situation, there are some obstacles, which affect the persons view towards life. They are fear and worry, negative self-image, unrealistic and over-expectations, and blaming others. All these blocks stop the growth of individual's success. Negative self-image and unrealistic expectations create insecurity and failure in life, causing frustration and hopelessness. This hopelessness is the main reason for depression. As result, this depressive feeling affects the individual's behavior and relationships. To achieve success college students have to be very attentive, ready to accept challenges, hard working and are extraordinary in their performance. There is strong relationship between examination, competition for grades and stress, due to the failure in exam and personal life they moved away from friends and family members. Due to the loneliness felling they found life hopeless which encourage them to sacrifice their life, one of the key to avoid these negative thoughts is not to lose hope, optimism and self esteem.People with high are capable of understanding their weakness and strengths, therefore, able to handle negative emotions more effectively than those who are not high on is common observation. Low Hope, optimism, poor self esteem seem to be related to lower satisfaction with life.HopeAccording to Snyder and Lopez (2002), hope is one of the human strengths that act as buffers against mental illness, all components of psychotherapy forces such as narration which buffers against mental disorder in just the same way does. Generally researchers tend to conceptualize either as complex, multidimensional construct or cognitive entity (Farran, Herth, & Popovich, 1995). conceptualized by Snyder (2000) which involves two main components is stated as, Hope is beyond wishful thinking that represented by person's ability to use their willpower or desire (agency) to get something (goal) accomplished and that person's ability to then creates various pathways (way power) to get the goal accomplished.Hope theory given by Snyder et al. ( 1991 ) focuses on rational and cognitive process of hope. The definition or process indicates the two major components of goal directed thought- pathway and agency. Human behavior is directed to achieve established goal and these goals are the targets of mental action sequence, which provides the cognitive component of hope. The theory is based upon the future oriented thinking. The nature of goal decides whether the will be strong or not. is trait like thinking process that develops in early childhood and maintained throughout the life span.Agency, the motivational component of theory refers to the perceived capacity to use once pathways to reach desired goals. Agency thinking reflects the self-determined thoughts about both beginning to move with pathways until the goal achieved. Agency thinking plays an important role in goal directed behavior, but when people encounter obstacles agency thoughts helps the person to apply the essential motivation as an alternate pathway (Snyder, 1994). Thus, the is a positive motivational state that is based on interactivity derived sense of successful ( 1 ) agency (goal directed energy) and (2) Pathways (Planning to meet goals) (Snyder, Irving & Anderson, 1991).Self- esteemThe term self-esteem, one of the oldest concepts in psychology that was used first by William James (1890). He described self-esteem as the average tone of self-feeling that each of us carries about with him, and which is independent of the objective reasons we may have for satisfaction or discontentResearchers like Cooper smith (1965), Crocker and Park (2004), Crocker and Wolfe (2001) defined self-esteem with reference to cognitive approach, that global self-esteem is decision people make about their worth as person. …",

Whether we're single or married, work at home or at an outside job, are highly social or more inwardly focused, we all depend on others to help us make sense of our lives, share companionship and laughter, and give and receive much-needed love and support during times of struggle. Relationships have cycles and a rhythm of their own, ups and downs brought on by events in our own lives or those of others. These events can be internal (such as coping with depression, or dealing with the onset of RA), or external (job changes, moving, childbirth, loss of a loved one). These stressors affect many aspects of our day-to-day lives, including the way we interact with others—and, often, the way others interact with us. We might become irritable, for instance, or seem to suddenly look at the world through new eyes and emerge with a whole different set of priorities— and this can cause reactions in others. As you may have discovered already, the onset of RA can be just such a life event.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Being in relationships is a basic part of being human-so much so, that we often take them completely for granted. Whether we’re single or married, work at home or at an outside job, are highly social or more inwardly focused, we all depend on others to help us make sense of our lives, share companionship and laughter, and give and receive much-needed love and support during times of struggle. Relationships have cycles and a rhythm of their own, ups and downs brought on by events in our own lives or those of others. These events can be internal (such as coping with depression, or dealing with the onset of RA), or external (job changes, moving, childbirth, loss of a loved one). These stressors affect many aspects of our day-to-day lives, including the way we interact with others-and, often, the way others interact with us. We might become irritable, for instance, or seem to suddenly look at the world through new eyes and emerge with a whole different set of priorities-and this can cause reactions in others. As you may have discovered already, the onset of RA can be just such a life event.",

      "abstract": "Il fenomeno del burnout, di cui tratta il libro, si riferisce a un tipo di esaurimento emotivo e professionale che colpisce frequentemente le professioni di aiuto. A caderci dentro sono spesso quelle persone partite con gli ideali piu alti, che si danno con entusiasmo agli altri. Dopo un primo periodo di profondo coinvolgimento, si rende evidente un continuo squilibrio tra richieste e risorse a disposizione. Quello che prima aveva particolare valore e sul quale si investiva perde man mano di senso. Motivazioni altruistiche e grandi ideali svaniscono. Lavorare pesa e stanca. Si cercano compensazioni o fughe di vario tipo per difendere la propria sopravvivenza. Il burnout, nonostante la sofferenza che crea, puo diventare un’occasione per riappropriarsi di se stessi e della propria vita. L’impegno di volersi bene puo tradursi in un esercizio costante e consapevole di assertivita. La capacita di prendersi cura di se stessi non deve essere vista come l’espressione del proprio egoismo, vissuta con senso di colpa e rimorso, ma considerata un antidoto efficace contro l’esaurimento energetico totale, una possibilita di conoscersi meglio e un’ulteriore occasione di crescita personale.",

The reality-denying self-deception is accompanied by the mobilisation of own protective potencies. Hallucinations are experienced fearfully, so that there is a situation of helplessness and danger. They are--as neurotic symptoms--an attempt to realise libidinous and/or aggressive desires with the manifestation of (condemning and punishing) defence in the projective perception.

      "abstract": "An interrogation is essentially combative and high pressure, and therefore most often a negatively charged monologue of an interrogator trying to work a confession out of a subject. In the following, there should be removed from any ethical, effective investigative interviewing practice: interrogation, combative, pressure, monologue and confession. Effective, ethical investigative interviews should be conversational, non-combative and should not seek confessions as a primary objective. Pressuring subjects (including suspects, witnesses or victims) forces people to lie, go silent or to become uncooperative. Pressure and accusations trigger defensive responses. They also cause panic and fear which impacts a person’s cognitive ability to remember and even to communicate. How often people in shock are left stuttering or unable to form coherent sentences or to remember a question asked seconds earlier? Combine the intimidation of being questioned by police, the fear of going to jail and the humiliation of being judged badly by people in authority or by one’s family and friends, as well as fear of reprisals for informing on other criminals, and one easily ends up with “no comment” interviews or flat out lies. Forcing subjects to admit a version of events in order to overcome “no comment” responses or flat out lies leads to poor conviction rates and wrongful convictions. The alternative, which has proven highly effective when practiced within a well-defined, controlled process, is a managed conversation that relaxes a subject and provides an environment and communication framework that inspires an exchange.",

When we give anonymously, there is a quiet happiness and peace inside. When we start to make a habit of this, it helps us to stop needing the acknowledgment and recognition. Being able to accept someone else's generosity is as important as being generous to others. When we give too much, we can also end up depriving the other person. We may end up enabling someone rather than allowing that person the opportunity for a learning experience. Generosity comes naturally. We become more focused on helping others, whether it is a manager developing her direct reports, a salesperson helping his prospect with a solution, or a team member committed to the project.",

Particular life situations are especially likely to lead to anxiety, and some people are more prone to become anxious than others. Given this, the anxiety disorders— like the mood disorders—are easier to describe than to explain. Consider the following example: A 40-year-old woman is referred for evaluation of anxiety. She describes herself as having been a “worrier” for most of her life, although the anxiety became much worse at age 17 following the death of her mother. At that time, she was seen in weekly psychotherapy for a year. She feels that the therapy helped her to cope, but she continued to worry about matters that she recognized were minor. She has tended to view her problems as being due to “not knowing where I am going in my life” and to difficulties in her interpersonal relationships. She describes herself as prone to self-doubt and rumination. She is perfectionistic, “expects the worst” even when she is putting forth her best efforts, and often worries about “what other people must think of me.” Her anxiety has always become more intense when starting at a new job. At these times, she has difficulty concentrating and finds herself constantly wondering if she is “passing the grade.” Over the past two decades, she intermittently has received further psychotherapy, and ultimately has seen five therapists for weekly psychotherapy, with each course of therapy lasting for 1–2 years.",

Without trust we could not anticipate the future, and we would therefore be paralyzed into inaction. Yet to trust and entrust is to become vulnerable and dependent on the good will and motivations of those we trust. Trust, ineradicable as it is, is also always problematic. Trust is most problematic when we are in states of special dependence-in illness, old age, or infancy or when we are in need of healing, justice, spiritual help, or learning. This is the situation in our relationships with the professions that circumstances force us to trust. We are forced to trust professionals if we wish access to their knowledge and skill. We need the help of doctors, lawyers, ministers, rabbis, priests, chaplains, or teachers to surmount or cope with our most pressing human needs. We must depend on their fidelity to trust and their desire to protect rather than exploit our vulnerability.",

The persistent anxiety you feel after the trauma makes you want to avoid anything associated with that terrible event. You might go out of your way to avoid certain people, places, or activities, or you might simply try to avoid ever thinking or talking about what occurred.

Our families give us other problems to worry about - separation, illness, failure, tragedy - and may not be willing or able to help us when we need them. Later life’s a problem list, and then you die! Looked at that way, depression and anxiety in old age become understandable, even ‘normal’ responses to declining faculties and dwindling resources. Dementia then becomes the cruellest way of outliving yourself, from which those of sound mind (even if not body) recoil in horror. Professionals and public alike can turn away from such problems, fatalistically attributing them to ageing because they believe that so little can be done.",

Hope is very difficult to keep going in the presence of persistent psychological symptoms, example anxiety, anger or a clinical depression. Hope is difficult to foster if a person's life has been one of neglect, rejection or abuse.

Some crises are developmental: part of the experiences of the life cycle. Other crises are acute events that have affected the capacity of the person to function. For some people, crises might seem to be a permanent way of living, and they develop mechanisms for coping.

Unavoidable sources of our ignorance include the following: (a) too much and too little information to reach knowledgeable consensus and interpretation within the time available for action; (b) no shared set of value priorities; (c) no agreement on how much context is necessary to be responsible for actions and interpretations; (d) spoken/written language cannot adequately map the complexity; (e) absence of reliable boundaries; (f) self-amplifying, unpredictable acting-out of the shadow; and (g) governance becomes uniquely problematic. Living constructively with these circumstances depends on (a) recognizing that we seek meaning, although, unavoidably, we live in illusions; (b) acknowledging the vulnerability and finiteness of ourselves and our projects; (c) lacking pride and arrogance in the conviction that we know what must be done and how to do it; (d) acting in the spirit of hope, not optimism; (e) acting in the spirit of “tentative commitment”; (f) being “context alert”; (g) being a learner/teacher; and (h) practicing compassion for all who must live and act under these conditions.",

      "title": "Extending control perceptions to the social self: Ingroups serve the restoration of control",
      "abstract": "Humans are motivated to maintain a sense of control. Throughout their lives, people face various important situations they cannot control. They walk the road of life unwaveringly until something makes them stumble or sink into soggy ground, pulling the rug from under their feet. When their sense of general control is shaken, they might feel as if the ground had vanished, while at the same time, they will try to regain a foothold on firm ground. Economic crises and instable conditions of employment, severe diseases of loved ones, and sudden breakups of important relationships represent examples of ground-shaking experiences that can diminish confidence in control over one's own life. Even just anticipating such events is sufficient to threaten perceived control, leading to the fundamental feeling that one can no longer master any situation or event. To alleviate the negative impact of low personal control and to reestablish a sense of personal influence, people can use different strategies to get out of the quicksand of control loss and to get back on firm ground again. Apart from merely idiosyncratic personal strategies, like putting more effort into personal professional goals after an uncontrollable partnership breakup, people can also use social strategies, like defending their own national values or supporting a collective movement, that involve the social environment to regainperceived control. In this chapter, we focus exclusively on social reactions to control threat that people use to maintain or restore a sense of control, specifically when personal control seems futile.",

      "abstract": "To leave home and go to live in another place is never a light undertaking, especially if the distance is great and the move a long-term one. Migration is inevitably accompanied by emotional stress. There is grief at parting. The journey may be full of new experiences, some exciting, others frightening and intense if life hitherto has been confined within local horizons. There may be helplessness induced by a strange language, the fear of misunderstanding or being misunderstood, changes of climate and diet, being physically distinctive, feeling unwelcome, experiencing social isolation and dependence on strangers. In addition to these common stresses, more specific anxieties affect particular groups. The refugee who leaves a homeland torn by violence may carry a burden of grief or uncertainty about the fates of family and friends, perhaps tinged with guilt. The displaced person may be exposed to the initiative-sapping institutionalisation of a transit camp. The migrant worker, forced by poverty to seek his fortune abroad, may have good reason to worry about the conditions in which he has left his family. The young man who sets out boldly for Eldorado may require instant success to justify his decision (and repay the debts he has incurred). A bride may be joining a husband she hardly knows, but on whom she will be utterly dependent.",

Some individuals concerned about contamination will spend hours showering or bathing, others will wash their hands almost constantly, and some will spend hours and hours of each day cleaning their home. In addition to cleaning there are a number of other compulsions including checking (e.g., individuals may check hundreds of times if all doors at home are locked), repeating (e.g., some people may wish to ease anxiety by repeating a name or phrase over and over), slowness (being overly meticulous and tidy and spending hours organising and arranging objects and possessions) and fear of contamination (e.g., a person may devote hours of the day to washing their hands and avoids any social contact with others due to the fear of contamination).",

Behind his congenial personality was a haunted trader whose past mistakes kept him from living up to his current potential. At a more successful time in his career, he had faced a battle with anger that had cost him a lot—not in terms of money but in the form of personal relationships. Although he eventually created a new life for himself personally, his past still bound him. He is afraid that he would fall back into bad habits. He is failing to truly commit himself to his trading game. He believes that if he pursues his goals wholeheartedly, he will put his personal relationships at risk. In terms of commitment, he is failing miserably. His fear of success, manifested in his inability to commit, could be costly not only in his career but also in his personal relationships, even if he does not recognize the danger. If he is uncomfortable with success, he may unwittingly invite failure as he approaches success. Here fear of failure and fear of success coalesce.",

      "title": "Bullying and labelling as communication tools of control and domination",
      "abstract": "Abstract Good communication skills are vital for success in life. In any conversation, involved parties may feel their personality is vulnerable and under attack. Likewise, we may quite often initiate a discussion with others about anything and unexpectedly find ourselves under attack by someone. The main reason is that someone began to feel insecure. Any time we feel insecure in a discussion we use one of the following strategies: fighting through bullying, labelling, name-calling, cynicism, antagonism; or dodging via the use of silence, avoiding others, or hiding our feelings. Consequently, effective communication retreats and the dialogue moves away from the subject matter towards protecting the self by resorting to defensive communication. Interacting defensively might look like we are still conversing over the subject matter; however, in reality, we are fighting about each other’s worries; yet we conceivably do not even comprehend ourselves or others in the process. In addition, we may not grasp what one says that triggered the other person’s vulnerability. This article looks at the extent to which Middle Eastern people use labelling and bullying as communication tools of control and domination along with the effects of using these tools on themselves, their parents and the wider societies. An exploratory survey was conducted to collect data. Key findings reveal that males and females using labelling and bullying derive satisfaction of that use. About 21.4 per cent of males and 11.1 per cent of females revealed that they were never taught or trained on ethical behaviours or about avoiding labelling and bullying others in their lives at home and/or in school. Moreover, the study shows that a great majority of bullied and labelled subjects reported to have refrained from informing their school administrators, teachers and parents that they were bullied and labelled by other classmates or peers. Due to the significance of these results, this study recommends that parents and educators should take urgent measures in order to prevent the negative effects of these communication tools on vulnerable individuals in society.",

      "abstract": "Grit is indeed characterized by having a strong passion and perseverance for long-term goals. It goes beyond simply putting in effort and includes the ability to persist and maintain determination in the face of challenges and setbacks. Grit involves a combination of effort, patience, and resilience. It's about staying committed and focused on your objectives, even when things get tough. Gritty individuals are not easily discouraged by obstacles or failures; instead, they see them as opportunities for growth and learning. Having grit can be beneficial in various aspects of life, whether it's personal goals, academic pursuits, professional endeavors, or even relationships. People with high levels of grit are more likely to stay motivated and continue striving for their goals, even when progress seems slow or when faced with adversity. It's important to note that grit is not about blindly persisting without adaptability or recognizing when it's necessary to change course. It's about finding the balance between perseverance and flexibility, knowing when to adjust strategies or approaches while still maintaining a steadfast commitment to the overall objective. Developing and nurturing grit can contribute to greater resilience, achievement, and personal growth. It allows individuals to navigate challenges and setbacks with a determined mindset, increasing their likelihood of success in the long run.",

Life is not easy and perfect, so every time I want something to happen I need to stop and think about what is going to be the next step; I need to help and push my self into the beneficial ways in life. I sometimes know how to benefit from a situation and sometimes I don't. To keep the surroundings in a certain organized order seem to be the most effective way to reach beneficial goals. Some situations in life can be changing or affecting the planning of what is to be done next. The absence of a required object can make it impossible to achieve what's been planned and set strong emotions free. To get stuck in a small situation that was meant to only be a halt to overcome to go to the next one can be frustrating and feel like taking a step into the unknown. One morning I was stressed and I could not find my keys and I thought that I would be greatly rewarded if I found them; the day was going to be perfect. But instead, my feelings of frustration took over and lead me into an ambivalent state where my body begun to react faster than my thoughts. I didn't have the will or time for anything else than to look for the key. Looking back at this situation I see that I was present in the moment but I spent my energy in an unbalanced way. I wasn't thinking clearly, I didn't even finish my thoughts running through my mind.

We translate this as “I’m not as strong a leader as he is.” • We learn of a parent complaint about us. We refute, “She’s a habitual complainer and has no idea what she’s talking about.” • We are greeted warmly and happily by a colleague who is usually less dramatic. We assume, “She must want something from me.” If we would take one day to monitor our assumptions, it may be eye- opening, even life- opening. Making an assumption is not the same as drawing a conclusion. Conclusions are reasoned suppositions. Assumptions are often automatic and habitual. We may not know we have them, so we don’t challenge them. We may also be aghast at the assumptions others make about us. A “No Assumptions Day” can change the style and content of our communications. It can challenge us to be clear with others about our own intentions and reasons. Shedding assumptions can liberate. It can illuminate. It can revitalize. Don’t make assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. (Ruiz, 1997)",

Likewise, there are many who are hopeless, isolated, and suicidal that do not engage in extremist violence and instead looking for a personal escape from their chronic pain and despair. A cognitive opening is a vulnerability in a person that allows others with an extremist point of view greater access to radicalize an individual toward violence. The desire to end chronic pain and commit suicide is a primary factor in most attacks. A suicidal person looks for a justification for their death in their attack plan, rather than sending a message to others through a violent attack. When a radicalized individual or group embraces violence as a justified pathway to achieve their political, religious, or social goals, this can transform to extremism and terrorism.",

Kalvero Oberg (1960) mentioned six negative feelings caused by culture shock, which were: (1) strain resulting from the effort of psychological adaption; (2) a sense of loss or deprivation referring to the removal of former friends, status, role, and possessions; (3) rejection by or rejection of the new culture; (4) confusion in the role definition, role expectations, feelings, and self-identity; (5) unexpected anxiety, disgust, or indignation regarding cultural differences between the old and new ways; and (6) feelings of helplessness as a result of not coping well in the new environment. Other adverse effects of a cultural shock were discouragement, lethargy, depression, suspicion,boredom, homesickness, anger, extreme sensitivity, irritability, loneliness and loss of familiarity.For students studying in a different cultural setting, this cultural shock may have a negativeimpact on them.This research aims to reveal the dominant cause of cultural shock and its effect on the studentswho are studying at Universitas Katolik De La Salle Manado-Indonesia.This study used the Analytical Hierarchy Process for data gathering and analysis. The respondents were students of Universitas Katolik De La Salle Manado who came from different provinces of the country. This study benefited the management of the University to improve theprogram that handled this cultural shock being experienced by the students to enhance theirstudies at the University.",

      "title": "Death by Suicide – Work with Family in Mourning",
      "abstract": "Suicide – calling for help, cry of despair, incomprehension, shock and a question ‘Why? Why did not he want to live, why did not he ask for help, why did not we notice anything?’ Death by suicide is always an immense shock for the family, acquaintances and the closest environment. It is the act of incomprehension of the causes and reasons for taking their own lives. When we hear of suicides we tend to focus on people who committed suicide and forget about those who were left with the unanswered question ‘Why?’ In most cases we ponder on the suffering of the person who committed suicide, on their motivation and an inexplicable choice of death and we forget about the relatives who have to face the suicide of a close person, struggle with loss, sorrow and despair. Family in mourning very often cannot handle the loss of a close relative and need some outside help because they either cannot rely on help from the family or friends or it is insufficient. We often do not know how to behave in the face of death, how to help people in mourning to accept the loss and come back to social and family life which goes on regardless of anything. Social work should become an answer to the needs of families in mourning and especially the ones that faced suicidal death. The article is an attempt to present methods and actions that a social worker can and should undertake while working with a grieving family. It points out the need for complete and professional preparation of a social worker. Social work with a client who has experienced the suicide of a close person necessitates a complete and professional action based on knowledge, intuition and also experience.",

Most of the time this takes place subconsciously, but at times, when our balance is threatened by a trip or a stumble, we suddenly become very conscious of what we have to do to stay upright. For a moment, we become afraid of falling. Some people who feel unsteady when they stand become so scared of falling that the fear itself starts to have an effect on them. Many of these people have fallen before, and do not wish to repeat the experience. Roughly an equal number have not had any falls, but are nevertheless fearful of them.Fear of falling causes a burden of disability as great as that caused by the injuries that result from falls.Fear of falling, and of its consequences, need not be confined to the person at risk of falling.",

      "abstract": "Anyone who seeks publication wants readers, but self-expression, self-assertion, and self-promotion have consequences, especially for those who draw on clinical material and who must honor publication standards of integrity and reliability, as well as ethical codes governing confidentiality, consent, disguise, and collaboration. This paper employs tools of literary analysis, principles of moral philosophy, and psychoanalytic theories about writing to show that writers of fiction and autobiography also struggle with these dilemmas. They worry about their responsibilities to the sources of their stories, and wonder if changing names and dates will prevent friends and family, whose lives get used as material, from feeling embarrassed, betrayed, or exploited. Because they understand that the composing process blurs boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, fantasy and memory, self and other, they recognize that an author's relationship with his or her subject (matter) can disable the capacity to recognize when self-interest has taken over a concern for the welfare of others. More important, literary authors are free to write about writing, and what they render transparent about primitive, unconscious processes suggests that what clinical writing has in common with fiction and autobiography should be included in efforts to update ethical standards and procedures regarding psychoanalytic publication.",

That is the way with children's play and it follows the depths to which play is embeded in our waking and sleeping experience. The withdrawn child may have a dearth, a blockage, or an excess of ideas. He or she may 'adhere' to an object, apparently fearful of exploring anything else. Or there may be such a rush of ideas that there's no time to settle on any one thing long enough to develop a game. Some withdrawn children enjoy the anonymity which often goes with regulated play. They can hide themselves in the pack and pass unnoticed unless they drop the ball or muff the goal. Improvisation on the other hand appeals to those who need a degree of privacy to find themselves.",

Suppose I feel alienated from my persistent desire to smoke, and am disgusted that the thought of dying while my children are still young isn't enough to extinguish that desire. I could talk to my friends about my predicament, confident that they would sympathize at least to some extent. If I were so inclined, I could also consult work from many distinct philosophical traditions, written in many different centuries, to learn what philosophers have thought was the best way to characterize someone in my condition; what they have thought someone in my condition ought to do; and what philosophical problems they thought could be illuminated by considering conditions like mine. I might learn that reflection on such cases could help in developing accounts of self-deception, wishful thinking, moral motivation, the nature of agency, and the boundaries of the authentic self. We also sometimes feel disgusted by—even alienated from—our experiences. More specifically, we sometimes feel alienated from a perceptual or sensory experience of ours because we are troubled by its evaluative shading. Many people, if you press them and they trust that you won't immediately turn and berate them, will acknowledge that they have experiences like the one I am about to confess. A woman walks by, and my visual perception of her includes the content fragility, and on reflection I realize that this content is positively valenced in my experience. And I don't just perceive her as fragile in the sense of floaty or graceful, but also fragile in the sense of breakable, or erotically consumable. I am disgusted with myself because no one is breakable in that sense. How could I be such that a fellow human looks that way to me? Yet if I look again, my moment of anguished self-castigation doesn't shake the way she looks to me. She still looks fragile, and in a pleasing way.",

      "title": "Sociology of Shyness: A Self Introduction",
      "abstract": "Only the shy know the pain of shyness, the intense inability to interact in social situations. shy often rationalize their shyness by saying, don't know these or These people make me uncomfortable--thereby laying the blame on others rather than dealing with their own problem. Shyness carries with it a fear that makes many unable to, say, ask out that girl or to seek the job promotion. Surely these opportunities would benefit us, or at least allow us to grow and learn. Shy people who may even recognize this, however, allow their perceptions of their faults, real or imagined, to prevent them from taking the chances others routinely take throughout a normal day. Their shyness, often begun during the school age (approx. 5-18 years of age), can go on to take more serious forms later in life such as depression and social anxiety disorder, to say the least. Several of the patients documented in the video viewed in class on multiple personality disorder had shy, or introverted, personalities. To compensate for this, they also developed stronger confident personalities that could accomplish what the shy personalities could not. In some instances this gave way to extreme, violent personalities bent on the destruction of the weaker ones. Growing up, I myself suffered from shyness. I projected negative qualities upon myself: I was too fat, too ugly, too smelly, too dumb, etc. Because of this I was unable to stick up for myself, usually falling prey to others who saw my lack of confidence as an exploitable weakness. I was unable to speak to girls for the longest time, and it has only been in my second semester as a Freshman in college that I have actually had a girlfriend. Shyness kept me isolated for much of my life, preventing me from creating meaningful interpersonal relationships throughout high school. To this day my best friend has never been to my house. Even today I find faults with myself. nose is too crooked, or one eye is lower than the other, or I am too critical of others, etc. Ironically, I have even gone so far as to say I am too critical of myself. What I fear most is that I am inadequate in every way imaginable and other people know this but will not tell me. It is this sort of paranoia that disturbs me enough to make poor decisions, though fortunately I have so far manage not to. In her essay Honor thy and Mother Nancy Chapin states, Parents are transmitters of attitudes that the child adopts in forming a self image(47). Of course it is true that many of our values are formed as children when we are most open to the experiences of the world, so it stands to reason that we would be most influenced by the people we come into contact with the most during this stage, our family being our 'primary group.' If a child is the recipient of care from parents who have much time to spend with them, that child will most likely act in a kind and caring manner. However, if a child lived with parents who were unable to spend time with her or acted violently towards her, she would more than likely become introverted and push away people who attempted to become close to her. In My Translucent Father (2002) Katie J. Dubaj portrays how her father slowly removed herself from her family, first by getting a divorce and slowly by not visiting her and later withdrawing child support. In a situation like this the child would more than likely be unsuccessful at relationships, being fearful of abandonment, driving people away from him or her. Shyness in itself is nearly the antithesis of social interaction as it prevents people from actually interacting with one another, instead relegating them to what they can experience in their own little secluded worlds. As Newman states in his textbook, Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life (2002), The primary theme of sociology is that our every day thoughts and actions are the product of a complex interplay...

      "title": "The Long and the Short of It: Strategies for Later and Strategies for Now",
      "abstract": "WITH APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS in my independent studio being high school age and under, get a lot of feedback on how young people think, feel, and act. After almost four decades of teaching, have seen this population become more and more resistant to growth, fearful of change, and terrified of failure. Many psychologists see this behavior as the result of a we're all number one and everybody gets a trophy parenting and educational style. Based on the belief that high self-esteem is a precursor of success and happiness, many of these kids have been raised and praised to literal perfection. They've been told they can do anything and be anything they want to However, when life experiences prove difficult and even unsuccessful, they often lack the resilience to handle said experiences.Recent research (and some might say, good old-fashioned common sense) indicates that high self-esteem and confidence may be more the result of successful personal performance rather than the cause of it. A combination of expecting and experiencing both successes and failures seems to be a better course of action than the extremes of nothing is good or everything is wonderful.As a teacher of singing, try to foster in my students a healthy balance between success-producing, comfortable exercises and repertoire, juxtaposed with more growth-encouraging and therefore risker techniques and rep. With this present generation of play it safe because messing up is frightening and unacceptable, find myself paying even greater attention to the percentages of the aforementioned balance. Let's call it working with the long and short of it-the short being what the student can do now and the long being what the student will be able to do or want to do in the future.Critical to the balance of long term and short term strategies, expectations, and goals is the student's understanding that both can be worked on within the same lesson. With the security of short term confidence in at least some voice technique and some repertoire, the student is ready to present in the now. He or she feels at least something is OK at this moment in time, be it a predictable range of a fifth or a song that fits into that fifth. Being able to convince the student that working on the later is unpredictable and could be messy initially, but is absolutely necessary in order for him or her to be a better singer, seems predicated on success and security in the now, now more than ever.For example, like many voice teachers, make an initial evaluation of a new student's strengths and weaknesses-what she/he does well and what she/he doesn't do well. This exploration has become more challenging in recent years. When put students through the paces of body position, respiration, audiation, phonation, resonation, articulation, and emotion (the tions list), I'm finding a stronger push back in terms of a willingness to try. This, of course, should be expected in beginners, but is somewhat surprising when encountered in previously trained or experienced singers. It's as if they are saying, I don't want to know my limitations and/or weaknesses. Let's just stay in my comfort zone, wherever that may be. So perhaps in the early sessions we might avoid the potential for brutto canto by coloring within the established vocal lines.However, an opening to start moving toward some long term growth might occur when a singer asks, What is my vocal range? To find a singer's at-the-moment voice range, one needs to do patterns such as scales or triads up and down the singer's range. In initial lessons, many singers stop before the actual physical end of fast and slow vocal fold vibration. Their reasons include, I don't want to crack, I don't want to sound bad, and What if can't hit the note?My response is, How will you know your present range unless you go beyond it? The bottom of your voice in Mechanism/Mode Ml (chest) has been reached when your vocal folds can't vibrate slow enough to produce the pitch. …",

Ongoing support may be overlooked and individuals who are connected with community groups or have fellow peers who are also in recovery have a higher chance of remaining clean. Quality of life can be limited for those battling to stay clean and is often routed in a lack of self -compassion or acceptance about themselves and their past using history and its ramifications. Vital therapy work may be omitted, and individuals may return to work or family life to make up for time lost in active addiction. It is essential in therapy to understand and make consideration for the lack of resilience brought on by years of addiction. Struggles to regulate emotions can be very difficult in early recovery.Self-compassion and self-acceptance are key in providing this platform of resilience as well as having loving relationships with people who understand and who those in recovery can share honestly with. Ongoing healthy recovery and happiness is increased for those who demonstrate self-acceptance, hold a compassionate view of themselves, can forgive others, manage resentments and also find a community or at least close friends and family who accept them for who they are and their past.",

On occasions turbulent, but at other times calm, it flows in a particular general direction whilst deviating here and there from a straight and narrow path. It meets and departs from other rivers or streams along the way, having a momentum of its own whilst both influencing and being influenced by the environment through which it flows. In the counselling encounter the lives of client and counsellor touch each other at a particular point in the life cycle of each. Each will be working, both inside and outside the counselling relationship, implicitly and explicitly, and with varying degrees of ease and success, on his or her development tasks - that is, those 'physiological psychological, and social demands a person must satisfy in order to be judged by others and to judge himself or herself to be a reasonable happy and successful person' (Chickering and Havighurst 1981: 25). Each phase of the life course has its own developmental tasks, the successful achievement of which contributes to personal happiness and to the successful management of later tasks. Failure contributes to unhappiness, social disapproval and/or later difficulties. This view of the life cycle is like a glue which binds together the experience of the helper and the client, and of the disparate concerns raised by clients at different life stages. The client's developments tasks will often be the raison d'etre of counselling.\r\n\r\nChickering, A.W. and Havighurst, R.J. (1981) 'The life cycle' in A.W.

      "abstract": "This article argues that boycotts, shunning, and shaming are sometimes corrupt because they create incentives that undermine important individual aims, enticing people into acting for inappropriate reasons. They harm targets by undermining belief formation, or by impeding efforts at living authentically, deterring targets from declaring their beliefs in public or from pursuing projects that they believe important. They are corrupt because they make their targets willing participants in undermining their own aims, subverting their individual ambitions not to allow money or social pressure to influence their beliefs and their most important actions. Although individuals must sometimes take responsibility for maintaining their own integrity – resisting temptations that might corrupt their thoughts and actions – people also have a moral responsibility not to undermine other people’s efforts at integrity.",

      "abstract": "We do not know ahead of time the impact of a particular encounter with a patient—for the patient or for ourselves. When I worked with families in hospice, I learned that sometimes my encounters began a meaningful conversation, which the patient then finished internally or with someone else. Sometimes I walked into the middle of a process begun by a colleague or someone else. And sometimes, I had the opportunity to be present for the end of the conversation— perhaps near the end of life or at the moment of death. I learned to not take encounters with patients for granted. Unfortunately, this lesson was also ignored or minimized when I felt the challenge to rush towards the next encounter demanding my attention. And so we are challenged to be attentive to where we enter the conversations with patients and challenged to be flexible in the course of our encounters with patients—a process of guiding and following the patients’ journey in their illness. The following story describes an encounter with a patient very early in my career as a hospice social worker. Afterwards, when I had self-doubt or wondered what to do next, I began to rely on respect, compassion and empathy along with my knowledge, skills and resources in the community. Later, one cancer survivor offered gratitude this way:",

Sometimes we take account of other people's success and well-being and are willing to sacrifice some of our own for their sake. Or so it appears. But perhaps altruistic behavior really springs from self-interest. For instance, isn't it in my long-term self-interest to help others, so that I can receive help in return when I need it? Isn't the patron of a charity motivated by his own prestige rather than by the needs of the beneficiaries? What matters to him is that his donations be visible and publicized, not who benefits from them. Some might argue (see chapter II) that people are always and everywhere motivated by self-interest and that differences in behavior are due only to differences in their opportunities. Civilized society, on this view, depends on having institutions that make it in people's rational self-interest to speak the truth, keep their promises and help others – not on people's having good motivations.",

      "title": "Suffering and end‐of‐life decision‐making",
      "abstract": "Perhaps watching someone you love suffer can teach you even more than suffering yourself can. Suffering is a complex concept, more nuanced than mere pain. Most faiths struggle with the incomprehensibility of human suffering. Claims about suffering in paediatric care can be ambiguous and value-laden. The word suffering comes from the Greek and Latin words meaning 'to carry beneath', and in Elizabethan England often meant to allow, as in 'suffer the little children to come unto me' (Fig. 1). The word passive derives from passio, the Latin word for suffering; passivity, helplessness and loss of control are core components of suffering. The everyday business of medicine is involved with patients who experience suffering from conditions such as pain, nausea, breathlessness, seizures, delirium and depression. However, a child of any age separated from loving parents suffers. Furthermore, parents, siblings, grandparents, friends and health-care staff are all subject to vicarious suffering when child patients suffer (Fig. 2). Any of us may experience suffering arising from the 'existential' or 'spiritual' dimensions of life: demoralisation, despair, doubt, loneliness, guilt, self-loathing or alienation from others. Health-care interventions aim to relieve suffering, but they also have the potential to cause suffering, for example, by prolonging a life that involves more burdens than benefits.1 We can all probably agree on that statement, but might struggle to reach a common view of what constitutes suffering. Indeed, the use of the term suffering has been challenged because clinicians may use it consciously or unconsciously to introduce unexpressed value judgements about quality of life into end-of-life decision-making.2, 3 The case of Charlie Gard exemplifies the problem.3 Charlie Gard was an infant with a rare metabolic disorder resulting in brain damage who required mechanical ventilation to survive. His parents wanted staff to start an untried experimental medication; medical and nursing staff thought Charlie should be palliated. The way Charlie's suffering or lack of it was invoked was paradoxical. Charlie's parents said he could sense their presence and squeeze their finger, the nurses demurred. The reason to palliate Charlie given by health professionals and accepted by the courts was to stop his suffering. The paradox is that the parents argued Charlie was aware but not suffering, whereas staff argued Charlie was unaware but suffering. Charlie Gard typifies the most common disagreement between parents and health-care professionals around end-of-life decisions, when the parents request continuing intensive care, with or without experimental treatment, against medical advice.2, 3 However, occasionally, the parents request palliation when one or more health-care professionals feels it is not ethically acceptable. How should we know what to do in this latter fraught circumstance? Most of our child patients are too young to express what their current life entails for them, to tell us whether and how much they are suffering. Parents whose children were in a paediatric intensive care unit, and the physicians and nurses looking after the children, had overlapping perceptions of what constituted suffering, but also significant differences.4 They agreed that unrelieved pain, discomfort, hunger, unhappiness and unpleasant feelings caused distress, but also hopelessness, powerlessness and a bleak future. Physicians described suffering as discomfort, anxiety, pain and dyspnoea; they took a long-term view and emphasised quality of life and disability. Nurses had a more short-term focus on signs of discomfort and measures to alleviate it. Parents described their child's suffering as physical pain and discomfort (e.g. nausea, vomiting and weakness), but also in terms of its spiritual or psychological aspect. Many parents raised their own suffering resulting from their child's illness, whereas doctors and nurses concentrated on the child's suffering and never mentioned the parents'.4 Of course we all have our own values and beliefs. These only become problematic in decision-making when they are unacknowledged, unexamined and lead to immutable thinking, in which case they are arguably biases.5 How can health-care staff avoid bringing unconscious value judgements to the table? The answer lies in humility and open-mindedness. We need to acknowledge that although we often have strong opinions, parents and other health professionals may hold other valid opinions. Health professionals sometimes frame decision-making in terms of a right or a wrong decision, which enables them to introduce their own subjective values, when on reflection there may be more than one ethically acceptable pathway. There are extremes where we can all agree and would feel compelled to over-rule parents. We would not accept that it is ethically acceptable for parents to decide not to feed their normal child. Nor is it ethically acceptable to ventilate a dead child even if the parents demanded it. But everything in between is potentially controversial, particularly when there is significant uncertainty about the child's prognosis.6 In general, the model we use in these days of family-centred care is that we inform parents and involve them in decision-making, while trying our best not to over-burden them by putting impossible life-or-death decisions on their unsupported shoulders.7 Who is this we? Usually, a lead physician takes responsibility for decision-making in conjunction with the parents (and the child if old enough). As long as the physician and the parents are not sharing a delusion, the decision is likely to be ethically justifiable. But what if the parents and the physician disagree? This is where the physician needs to consider the possibility that others might disagree ethically with their view, however strongly they hold it. Furthermore, they need if possible to maintain their therapeutic relationship with the child and the parents, because a new physician would have to start anew to develop a relationship. This means trying to understand the parents' views and values, to speak respectfully to them at all times, however much you may disagree. Even if parents use threatening language, physicians can set limits to behaviour and language without using condescending or judgmental language. Many assert it is no longer acceptable to use 'futility' alone as a basis to palliate a ventilated child. Futility is relative: what seems futile to a health-care professional may not be futile to the parents. However, the futility of continuing to ventilate Charlie Gard with any meaningfully beneficial outcome achievable is arguably one of the stronger arguments for stopping.2, 3 The term 'quality of life' has been challenged for its subjective, value-laden nature.8 Now the concept of suffering has suffered the same fate. Framing the problem solely in terms of the child's 'best interests'8 is also problematic, because 'best' implies only one decision is ethically acceptable. Furthermore, some physicians talk as if a child has 'best interests' or 'rights' in isolation, as if a child soars free through the skies in splendid isolation, whereas a child exists in relation to its family. For most children, happiness rests within the family. The effect of the child's illness and survival on the family is morally relevant. If the family finds the situation intolerable, life may well be intolerable for the child too. If we can accept that a child's life may become so burdensome that it is truly not worth living, how do we decide when that point has been reached? Trying to weigh the burdens and benefits of a child's continued existence to the child, but also to the family and society, does not eradicate the problem of subjective assessment, but it is an ethical construct which is arguably less value-laden. If all physicians agree that palliation is not ethically acceptable it cannot be offered, but if at least some physicians think palliation is ethically acceptable, particularly if there is prognostic uncertainty, then surely the parents' view should carry greater proportional weight. They know the child better than anyone else. They have to live with the consequences of the decision more than anyone else. If reasonable, physicians hold differing views of how much suffering is ethically acceptable, surely we should be extremely reluctant to over-rule parents in life and death decisions about suffering. We thank Ken Nunn, Jill Sewell, Mark de Souza, Melanie Jansen and Bernadette Tobin for wonderfully constructive suggestions.",

      "title": "Escaping from the Self-Esteem Trap",
      "abstract": "GARDNER GATELEY [*] ONE CONTEMPORARY VIEW of our relationships with ourselves holds that we require self-esteem. Advocates of this perspective believe that lack of this trait underlies just about every category of human failings: school failure, juvenile delinquency, depression, self-hate, divorce, child abuse, domestic violence, even sin in general. Consequently, many helpers today try as best they can to enable their clients to increase self-esteem. Some clients fail to do this and may wind up blaming themselves for one more weakness: their inability to esteem themselves. Attempts at developing self-esteem in others sometimes fail because of the nature of self-esteem: to have it you must take full credit for your accomplishments and total blame for your failures: thus you have to achieve almost all of your goals. William James (1950, p.310) taught us years ago that self-esteem is equal to your accomplishments divided by your pretensions [provided that you take credit and blame for your successes and failures]. A person can work on developing self-esteem by increasing accomplishments or by giving up pretensions. If you pretend to have the ability to become a brain surgeon when you don't, as did the Jethro television character of The Beverly Hillbillies, you doomed to fail and thus dislike yourself, blaming yourself for all your failures. As long as you give yourself credit for your accomplishments and blame for your failures, to develop self-esteem, you have to reduce frustrations. Consequently, to develop self-esteem in clients, therapists must help them increase their accomplishments or reduce their pretensions or probably do both. Another reason why the search for self-esteem creates self-contempt is that this quest causes seekers to compare themselves to others. You can nearly always find someone who seems more successful than you are. All accomplishments relative. Comparing yourself to others can lead to envy, jealously, hatred of others, competitiveness, and various degrees of demoralization. Most teachers sense the presence of these feelings in their students, and many school psychologists aware of the nonproductive behavior these feelings can provoke. I have heard people blame the recent shootings in the schools and elsewhere on low self-esteem. If we are what we do, most of us have sufficient shortcomings and weaknesses, provided we judge ourselves by our actions, to develop strong feelings of self-hate. One human responsive demamap (MacNeal, 1997) seems to be When you frustrated and hate yourself, you should do all that you can to make others feel the same [those who seek to esteem themselves seem to fall into this category]. Another important point: the seeker for self-esteem, the self-hater, seems to be already afflicted with arrogance; he believes that he is capable of judging the merits of humans, and his self-hate is the result of his arrogant judgment of himself! Do we want to increase his sense of self-importance? If you esteem yourself, don't you need someone to disparage? It appears to me, that because searching for self-esteem often leads to frustration and self-hate in a world that operates on a two-value system (you have to either hate yourself or esteem yourself; therefore if you don't esteem yourself, you must hate yourself) we had better give up the search, and discourage others from embarking on this miserable journey. The Escape Route The road to contentment may be the way of self-acceptance, humility, and esteem for, or, at the very least, acceptance of others. Perhaps we might be better off if we could take ourselves out of the picture. Everybody I know could justify feeling humble, but self-esteem seems difficult if not impossible to justify. The Dalai Lama recommends considering how much you have suffered as a technique for developing humility, and this works for me (Dalai Lama and Cutler, 1998, p. …",

In fact, patience is a virtue that everybody must possess. Patience makes us better people. Building empathy towards others is very important if you want to live a hassle-free life. Patience helps you build empathy towards others. Patience helps us accept other people as they are and makes us tolerant. By being impatient, you suffer more than other people. To shape your talents and inborn abilities into real achievements, you must have patience. Whoever wants to lead a higher life must cultivate patience. He must possess an open mind; and be slow to arrive at conclusions. The patient man resolutely declines to be guided by what is immediate, near at hand. In thought, he declines to form his judgments from the external appearance of things. In action, he declines to be led away by the pains and pleasures of the moment. Therefore, when joys come, he is not elated; when sorrows befall, he does not lose heart; these are just the two marked characteristics of a great man. An old proverb says, “The patient man will rule the world.” It is perfectly true. At any rate, no impatient person ever achieved anything great in life. When you take things patiently, look at difficulties calmly in the face, half their power to overwhelm you is gone. Patience is the greatest ally of courage.

They worry they will show signs of anxiety, such as blushing, sweating, or trembling, or that they will do something that will cause others to think less of them, such as saying something silly or boring. They typically have images of their fears unfolding while in these situations and are convinced that others will see them as they appear in their images, leading to negative evaluation, criticism, or rejection.

      "abstract": "Children and teenagers may experience trauma as a result of exposure to many different kinds of life-threatening circumstances. Particularly, exposure and witness to violence, engenders feelings of despair and hopelessness. Severe events shake beliefs about the world as a safe place and life as fair, sway hope and dampen expectations for a sunny future. Children try to do all they can to retain in themselves the goodness they sense in close relatives, an authentic community and a gracious God. Even though the threat has ended, effects of trauma may continue. Women who suffer from unresolved childhood trauma often have difficulty establishing a secure attachment with their children, involuntarily transmitting stress through their own feelings of anxiety and helplessness. Sometimes these deep feelings may draw out the woman's desires to be an ideal mother for the child and to save him or her from everything, big and small, misfortunes and failures. In spite of this desire or because of it, she produces dangerous situations for the child. Maria came to me for psychotherapy. She felt guilty that her son was scalded by boiling water in her presence in the kitchen. She found out that, contrary to her desire to be an excellent mother, she sometimes came off second-best in this. When she was 12, a girl, her close friend was raped and tortured to death. Now, being adult, she feels that unknown force pushes her to rescue children. As a result of her past trauma she identified with the 'Wounded Healer' archetype. Her work in Sandplay therapy brought a depth of understanding through symbolic expressing of original sufferings. The greater awareness of influence of traumatic experience for her life brought possibility for a conscious choice of a way to cure children's wounds.

      "title": "A Journey through the Labyrinth of Mental Illness: Families Confront a Child with a Mental Illness, Driven by a Powerful Combination of Love, Uncertainty, Worry, and, in Some Cases, Desperation",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] SARA has always had the best laugh, joyful and infectious. She also is one of the bravest people I know. From the time she was an infant, Sara was an eager child who found fun in almost everything. She loved learning and people and took on new challenges and friends with delight. No one anticipated in those early years that sprouting within this happy, charming child were the seeds of the generalized anxiety and panic disorder that would frame much of her childhood and young adult life. Other than Sara, I suppose my husband Glenn and I were least prepared of all. Behind every student dealing with a mental health problem is a family trying to grasp what's happening to their child and struggling to do its best. That effort is often muddled, sometimes inadequate, and occasionally even counterproductive, but it's almost always driven by a powerful combination of love, uncertainty, worry, and, in some cases, desperation. Educators naturally see a student with mental illness through the lens of learning. However, understanding the child and family perspective is critical to meeting the student's needs effectively. Our journey through the labyrinth of mental illness began when Sara was seven, although we didn't realize at the time. She became afraid to go to bed at night, a seemingly normal childhood fear. We did what parents do: We read extra stories, sat on the edge of her bed, rubbed her back, and tiptoed out of her room after she had fallen asleep, night after night. Sara couldn't tell us what she was afraid of beyond not wanting to be alone. Despite our increasingly longer bedtime routine, things got worse, not better. Sara started worrying and talking about being afraid to go to bed at dinner, then when she got home from school, then in the car on the way to school, then when she got up in the morning. Her fear began to consume our attention. Sara was doing well at school. She loved music and art and had close friends. Then her 2nd-grade teacher started sending home notes saying Sara was being disruptive. She wasn't waiting her turn to speak in class. She raised her hand but blurted out answers to questions anyway. She interrupted her classmates. The teacher not-so-helpfully suggested we tell Sara to stop, which we did but Sara did not. Discussions about Sara's respectfulness and self-control added to our collective dinner table angst. Sara also began to complain of headaches and went to the school nurse frequently, so we got her eyes tested. Her new glasses helped her see the blackboard better but didn't do much for the headaches. It didn't occur to us that both Sara's overzealous need to be recognized and her headaches were related to her fear of bedtime. We were clueless. Looking back now, I can see that the seeds of some of our biggest mistakes were planted in these early days and with them what would become for Sara an insidious self-doubt. After weeks of near hysteria leading up to bedtime every night, our patience frayed. Sara didn't seem to be making any progress toward getting over it and being comfortable again to sleep in her pretty bed with her menagerie of stuffed hippos. Her inability to articulate exactly why she was afraid frustrated Glenn, in particular, who became convinced she was just being difficult, and we needed to stop coddling her. In ignorance and frustration, we turned what should have remained abundant empathy and support into a disciplinary nightmare. Our concern and frustration became exasperation, which became dismissal of her fears and then anger and punishment. Not surprisingly, Sara didn't respond well to our growing intolerance. Anger-based discipline doesn't change behavior any better at home than does at school, particularly when fails to address the underlying cause of the behavior. We reached a breaking point the night Glenn, an incredibly loving father who would do almost anything for his children and pretty much has, spanked Sara, who became so hysterical she threw up. …",

      "abstract": "Bereavement happens to us. Bereave means “to deprive, to dispossess or strip from.” Our most wrenching experience is losing someone close to us through death. The lack of choices makes us feel that the world is out of control and that we are powerless to influence major events in our lives. Grief holds a prominent place in our lives as survivors, but it is only a part of what we experience and do. Grieving as coping requires that we respond actively, invest energy, and address tasks. The emotion of grief is a complex experience, combining elements of belief, disposition, pain and anguish. We can support others as they use coping capacities that work well for them. Respecting their individuality requires that we enable them to remain in character and cope on their own terms and in their own ways.",

      "abstract": "Extract About the Finding Solid Ground Program The challenges that trauma survivors often face can feel overwhelming. Trauma can cause or contribute to many problems for survivors, including: ... Despite wanting to heal and feel safer, trauma survivors may not believe that healing or getting and feeling safer is possible. Many may unfairly believe they do not deserve to feel better. People who have experienced trauma may also do risky or unhealthy things in an effort to get some relief—even if only for a short time—from their emotional pain and symptoms. (Unfortunately, although it may not be readily apparent to trauma survivors, these risky and unhealthy behaviors contribute to keeping them feeling unsafe, which keeps them from making better progress toward healing and recovery.) Learning new ways of doing things is hard for all of us—especially if someone feels confused and conflicted about getting safer and doing things differently, as people who have experienced trauma often do. It often does not feel OK to make changes that go against “lessons” or “rules” learned as part of being hurt or mistreated. (For example, people who have experienced trauma may believe they do not deserve to feel good, or safe, or happy, even though these thoughts are not true or fair—people who have experienced trauma do deserve to feel good, safe, and happy.) Furthermore, talking about trauma-related reactions can sometimes remind people of past trauma and lead to trauma-related reactions. This in turn may increase the person’s urges to engage in unhealthy, risky, and unsafe behaviors.",

For adults, the author suggests concrete ways in which loneliness can be mastered and overcome. For example, sharing one's house with another person, having a pet, doing volunteer work, travelling, taking up a hobby, etc. In short, we need to reach out to life and not wait for it to come to us.",

As a result, the child may become isolated from human contact and absorbed in a world of repetitive, obsessional activities and interests. Children with autism may behave in strange ways. They may jump up and down excitedly at the sight of the water running from the taps, yet ignore attempts by adults to turn activities into a ‘social’ game in which others can share. They may look past you, or only very briefly at you, and make you feel as if you are an unimportant part of their world. They may call you when they need something, but otherwise virtually ignore you, spending hours lining up objects in the living room, or flapping their hands and fingers excitedly as they repeatedly flick through picture books or magazines.",

There are certainly some people who are so timid in their disposition, or nervous in their temperament, that they are constantly tortured by fear. They are afraid of almost everything; they are afraid when they need not be; indeed they are afraid of things that do not even exist. Some are in such a state of fear, yet cannot tell precisely what it is that they are afraid of; it is fear they are afraid of, and of what they know not.",

Ongoing support may be overlooked and individuals who are connected with community groups or have fellow peers who are also in recovery have a higher chance of remaining clean. Quality of life can be limited for those battling to stay clean and is often routed in a lack of self -compassion or acceptance about themselves and their past using history and its ramifications. Vital therapy work may be omitted, and individuals may return to work or family life to make up for time lost in active addiction. It is essential in therapy to understand and make consideration for the lack of resilience brought on by years of addiction. Struggles to regulate emotions can be very difficult in early recovery. Self-compassion and selfacceptance are key in providing this platform of resilience as well as having loving relationships with people who understand and who those in recovery can share honestly with. Ongoing healthy recovery and happiness is increased for those who demonstrate self-acceptance, hold a compassionate view of themselves, can forgive others, manage resentments and also find a community or at least close friends and family who accept them for who they are and their past.",

It is all the more surprising therefore to find no trace of obvious danger in these accounts that mostly focus on seemingly mundane social events. The main source of threat looming is the possibly indifferent or demeaning reactions of others. Although these are not without practical consequences (in terms of social standing), at worst, the immediate prospective harm would be loss of face, not of limb or life. Irrespective of how likely such embarrassing incidents are to occur, the foreseen response to them seems exaggerated by any standard. Indeed, these individuals describe experiencing an almost unrelieved dread, uncertainty, and helplessness with much rumination directed towards guessing various conjunctures that may arise in the future while also brooding over their own awkwardness and incompetence. These are contemplated with a sense of pending doom. Periods of discouragement and loss of hope, especially in the face of setbacks, punctuate the uninterrupted sense of threat.",

      "title": "Positivity from the base to the roof",
      "abstract": "The problem overall: Now let me discuss about those positive minded people who sometimes losses their positivity. Who wants to lose? Who wants failure? Actually nobody, every person wants to be a winner at least in one field but if we don't have proper knowledge about our efficiency, power and limits then after the failure we will get extreme mental dissatisfaction and so no mental peace. Our consciousness is the main reason behind our peace or satisfaction, and who has so much consciousness about themselves? Actually most of the people do not have it and how can I say it firmly- because most of the people has more than one reason to be unhappy. The main problem now a day's are man's enormous thirst either for money or for fame or for both. Parents are busy to earn money so they both do job and there is no one to stand beside the child when she/he is afraid or depressed, there is no one to make clear her/his doubts and confusions and after coming back home those parents expect something good from their children. These types of parents suffers from fond of both money and fame and treating in this way they expect caring and respectful behavior from their children.There are some people also who are thirsty for fame according to them they are doing their best to guide their children and at the end what they actually and only want is only successful result, they want their children should be a winner in every step of their lives and also in every phase and that's why both types of parents mentioned above are giving their children best schooling ,best teachers and lots of facilities in every field but actually what they are doing is pressurizing and compelling their children to do according to theiifparent's) thought, a child is taking swimming class ,art class, dance, attending school and then tuition and they have to come first in every field and they have to be the best in every field. It's not at all bad to give our children the best things rather every parents want to do so but it become a problem when they never ask about their (children's) interest ,it becomes problem when they never try to understand or realize about the capabilities of their children and so the sufferers are those children who has these types of parents and these type of wrong and negative psychology of parents affect the life of children ,so what are the problems children suffer for the activity of those parents?-----when a child meets a failure these parents never ask their child the reason of failure, never discuss what problem the child is facing ? Rather they are busy to criticize their children for their failure.This was a type of negative psychology which can be observed in few parents.The life and society: Life has different stages and in every stage we have to fight or struggle for existence. We are growing up every day with increase of age and with experience and knowledge. It's true that good experience always gives good teaching and good lesson but life sometime gives bad experience also and generally it always left with a bad impact and sometime better to say changes our view point from positive to negative, but we have to understand that nothing is purely positive and nothing is purely negative and if we can't find out the positivity then it's our fault and it will be very impractical thought if we expect only positive experience or incidents in Ufe.Life has different meaning to different people and in most of the cases it can be seen that many people are suffering from fear of failure ,some students are reluctant to give exam due to fear of failure and some are spending their lives with huge tension during giving exam and till the results come ,so what is the reason behind this failure, because now a day's everyone studies for marks, nobody studies for knowledge ,actually there can't be seen a so called 'good boy' who does not have any tension before ,during and after exam ,this is the fact and who is responsible for this type of activity among students ? …",

Healing, said Rank, occurs in an empathic I–Thou relationship with another person who affirms our difference. As we become more aware of our difference from others, beginning to assert our difference may threaten separation from existing relationships, leading to a desire for likeness. In therapy, we can learn how to balance difference and likeness. If we are able to accept our difference in this microcosm, without too much anxiety or guilt-feeling, then living and loving more fully outside the therapy hour may also be possible for us. Becoming creative requires individuating and connecting, without succumbing to the anxiety and guilt-feeling that leads us to be whipsawed from one pole to the other.",

Depression leads to weight gain and weight loss, difficulty sleeping, loss of energy, difficulty thinking, improper communication, lack of concentration, feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, excessive guilt, and attempts to suicide. Depression is among one of the top mental health concerns, and the rate of depression among people continues to rise in their life depending upon the situations which occur around them and within them. The increasing rates of depression may be due to increased awareness or increased incidence not yet cleared, but it is leading to a serious problem in the life of humans. Students face new challenges in their academic duration, such as making independent decisions, about their lives, and studies, adjusting to the academic challenges, environment, job seeking and interacting with various range of new people in universities and hostels. For academic fulfilment, many students mostly leave their homes for the first time and stay in hostels, which distances them from their family &amp; friends' support and many of them fail to adjust to new situations. These certain life changes can affect the mental health and well-being of students.

Gradually, Graham began to explore whether his identification in the pornography was with the \"being done to\" and \"up for anything\" aspect, the recipient, not the perpetrator of the acts. This was a focus of exploration for several sessions, and on one occasion of thinking about whom he identified with in a particular image, he rather abruptly associated to a memory. The use of Internet pornography in an increasingly casual manner is common.

Through depression, Graham became angry, an expected phase of mourning loss and trauma. He continued to use Internet pornography, but felt increasingly uncomfortable with it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People strive for certainty due to an inherent desire for it. Uncertainty seems to be stressful in the same unconscious manner as anger and fear. We cannot really control this feeling, and we feel relaxed only when we feel certain about what we know or about what we should anticipate. However, our world is filled with uncertainty and so are most aspects of our life. Therefore, instead for looking for certainty where it does not exist, we had better learn to appreciate uncertainty and learn to live and deal with it. Education could play a major role here. But a major shift is necessary from the current educational practice of providing yes or no answers to one that would educate people to understand and deal with risk and uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "will let my caregivers know who am? We have come to fear frailty more than death. We imagine being put in a nursing home, like a jar on a lonely shelf. Will a parade of paid strangers take care of me someday? Such images have become focal point ofour fear. Frailty coupled with abandonment has become our most dire existential dread. Not everyone has a partner whose life would pause for an illness and for whom no other priority would compete. An otherwise loving son or daughter may be caught up in flurry of raising a family and earning a living. Friends may be preoccupied with their own troubles and endeavors. Anyone can end up living at mercy of strangers, having to count on kindness or ache from its absence. Ordinary life activities, distracting and hurried as they are, tend to obscure this truth. Beneath our many doings, time and damage accrue, but we avert our eyes. Asking ourselves, Who would take care of me if got sick? seems to threaten our other aims. We prefer to push such questions aside. But pushing aside what we fear only adds force to it. Aikido, Japanese martial art, teaches us to go with force threatens us, rather than oppose it. Without resistance, there can be no collision. Instead, there is fluid motion, more like rushing water than intransigence of stone. Going with question of our eventual frailty causes a cascade of meanings. AT THE MERCY OF STRANGERS Disability obscures individuality like a mask. When a doctor speaks to person pushing a wheelchair rather than to its occupant, utter negation occurs. How is she feeling today? The one who has been negated can always shout, I am fine, doctor, thereby declaring her continued status as a person, but harm has already been done. To be overlooked, to be discounted even for a moment, wounds even after apologies have been extracted or hasty recognition has been won. To have to fight to be seen -that is what causes damage. The end of my sours dominion will surely arrive on day find myself lined up in a hallway in a row of wheelchairs waiting to be loaded into an elevator, then transported to a dining room and positioned into a row of waiting mouths. may overhear one staff member say to another, I've got to cut this one's meat, then I'll feed one. At this juncture, 1 will have become an object rather than a subject. will have become that onewho must be acted upon, rather than a person engaged in her own life. will have become someone's task. will have become my needs. If do reach point where can no longer feed myself, hope hands holding my fork belong to someone who has a feeling for who am. hope my helper will remember what she learns about me and her awareness of me will grow from one encounter to another Why should this make any difference? Yet am certain my experience of needing to be fed will be altered if it occurs in context of my being known. will let my caregivers know who am? Unless can, eyes looking at me will merely reiterate my physical deterioration. They will perceive only my gnarled fingers and stark metallic fact of my wheelchair. Just another old lady. Much is presumed on basis of such surfaces. know will recoil from my helper's singsong voice, well-meaning tilt of her head, her every gesture exudes kindliness. All of this will consign me to a category, the frail, boundaries of which will be to breach. Are there ways to maintain self in such situations? Perhaps we have most to learn in places we least want to reside. The difficult people in nursing homes are those who refuse to be diminished. have watched them demand, threaten, and rage until their requests are heeded. Their dignity causes trouble in systems of care meant for efficiency. They insist on prickly assertion of self in places where idiosyncracy is inconvenient. …",

Co-operations between people that occasionally, possibly, do not work; how certain relationships, like certain materials, can have various breaking-points; that materials can be laden with numerous preconceptions, for instance what they should be used for.Beginning from the perspective of a feminist commune, I have explored the concepts of family, belonging, and loneliness. I have interviewed, observed, photographed, and through living in the commune during shorter periods of time, I have taken part in their every-day life. Through this investigation I have become more aware of my view on loneliness and belonging, regarding both myself and others. Can we as humans stand alone, or is interdependence necessary to reach our full potential? Can we experience loneliness in spite of co-existence? And can we feel togetherness in our loneliness?I have created objects in which I hope the observer can recognise themselves, in the emotions I wish to communicate. It may be about shame; shame for not fitting in; not belonging; a nagging sensation that you are not “right”. It may be the dark side which can arise through togetherness; like being situated in an environment where you are surrounded by people but still do not feel you belong; but also the feeling of release that a self-imposed seclusion can give.

      "abstract": "The death of a loved one can be devastating to those who remain behind. The sense of profound loss, pain, emptiness, and disorientation presents significant challenges to those who experience such losses, and even other types of losses. Although grief and mourning are normal responses to this, the process itself may be complex and challenging. This can be particularly true when the grieving process is disrupted, may be regarded as inappropriate, or even worse, when it is not legitimised at all. The article explores some of the dynamics of prolonged or complicated grieving related to the loss of a loved one, with particular focus on the notion of disenfranchised grief. The author argues that ignoring the existence and impact of grief-denying cultures and practices, due to social delegitimization, or other factors, may severely impact a person’s ability to regain a meaningful and balanced life after such loss. In discussing these the article inevitably reflects on the relevance and appropriateness of the notions of disenfranchised grief and prolonged or complicated grief.",

Aside from seeking psychotherapy or quitting one's job, there are five ways to deal with this anxiety.

Children away at school are forced to fend for themselves; whatever the help from peers and encouraging supervision from staff, the very process of adaptation that is so highly-regarded as character-building having to be independent, reliable, tough, on the outside at least carries a psychological price that can lead to life-long problems in adulthood, if not sooner.",

Among friends, playful forms of mockery allow people to express their suspicions or ill-feelings directly, without the fear of causing harm. Among relatives, by contrast, suspicions and ill-feelings are typically concealed. While people may talk about other minds when those minds are not around, they refrain from direct confrontation. To confront one's relatives is to make them feel 'pain in their hearts', and to do so is to risk losing them to sickness or damaging enduring arrangements of care. Ancestors and shamans, who can see and hear more than others, play a crucial role here in governing opacity: exposing suspicions and ill-feelings when people feel they cannot speak of them.",

Children are surrounded by potential dangers everyday, but when an event threatens or causes harm to a person’s emotional and physical well-being it becomes a traumatic event. Counselour can decrease the effect of disaster. the counselor can apply knowledge of psychological, sociological and developmental principles in emergency response. Research shows that in addition to parents, families and other caregivers, the school community plays an important role in helping children survive traumatic events. Children spend a large portion of their time in school and often think of it as the place they go to learn about the world. Because the memory of traumatic events can cause intense fear, anxiety and distress, people often want to escape or avoid anything associated with the trauma. Although avoiding reminders of the trauma provides temporary relief, it is one of the main reasons why some people don’t recover. When people rely on avoidance to cope, they don’t have the opportunity to come to terms with what happened to them or to develop skills that will help them feel safe when thinking about traumatic events.",

      "abstract": "The process of mourning is a reaction of affection when a loved one is lost generally through death but can also be felt in the case of a disappearance or final separation. Freud in 1917 defined it as ... an extraordinary painful reaction needing an intensive psychological working-through... where the function is to detach from the dead person the memories and the hopes of those who are alive. Pierre Rousseau [1] adds is the adaptive process brought about by the loss of a loved-one, an object, a situation, a project,... for which one has a value. From the moment one hears the fatal news, one experiences a sensation of extreme physical distress, an intense muscular weakness with a tendency to faint, digestive troubles, attacks of agitation together with uncontrollable crying and sobbing. With time, these acute troubles are replaced by chronic difficulties which do not disappear until the long process of internal assimilation of the mourning, which usually lasts about one or two years, is accomplished. These troubles are characterised by deep fatigue, weakness, appetite changes, cardiac palpitations, loss of memory, concentration difficulties, hormonal imbalances, decrease in the effectiveness of the immunological system. This decrease in the immunological defence is responsible for the increase in mortality and illnesses of people in mourning. It should be remembered, however, that the mourning process is quite normal and that its manifestations are not pathological. To block the process would be, on the contrary, a cause of pathology.",

This book highlights the emotional turmoil which, to a greater or lesser extent, accompanies these changes. It considers the nature of the anxieties aroused by a new situation and the ending of a previous state at various stages in life. Endings and beginnings are shown to be closely related, for every new situation entered into, more often than not, involves having to let go of some of the advantages of the previous one as well as losing what is familiar and facing fear of the unknown. The author shows how all these aspects of change evoke primitive anxieties, stemming from our earliest experiences of coming into this world. While beginning life outside holds the promise of a wider, more enriching existence it involves the loss of the known, relative safety of life inside mother's body. Moreover, the human newborn is at first utterly helpless, totally dependent on others to keep him alive.",

      "title": "Symbolic protest and calculated silence",
      "abstract": "The reasons for protesting a serious injustice are usually not hard to find. One wants to put an end to the wrongdoing, to prevent its recurrence, or at least touch some consciences in a way that may prove beneficial in other contexts. But sometimes there seems to be no reasonable hope of achieving these ends. The perpetrators of injustice will not be moved, protest may be inconvenient or risky to oneself, and its long-range effects on others may be minimal or may include as much harm as help. To protest in these circumstances seems at best a symbolic gesture. But is it a gesture worth making? Attitudes about this diverge sharply. Some say that, despite the consequences, protest is called for: “One cannot stand silently by.” To denounce injustice at a risk to oneself is morally admirable, they say, whether or not it produces a positive net utility. Others see symbolic protest as pointless and at times reprehensible. If the overall effects for others are not better and it entails harm or risk to oneself, is it not foolish? And isn't the motive simply a self-righteous desire to be, or appear, morally “pure”?",

      "abstract": "Abstract “Trust is the glue of life,” wrote the American author Stephen R. Covey about what he considered to be the most essential ingredient in effective communication. “It’s the foundational principle that holds all relationships—marriages, families, and organizations of every kind—together” (Covey et al., 1994, p. 203). This insight captures the essence of what this book is all about—an exploration into the critical role of trust. In our daily lives, trust is not only necessary when someone opens the door early in the morning and leaves the house to start the day; it forms the basis of our most routine actions and interactions. Without this fundamental trust, even the simplest tasks become daunting, underscoring the pervasive influence of trust in shaping our experiences. Trust dependence becomes even more pronounced in situations where individuals commit long-term resources, manifesting in forms such as marriage, pursuing higher education, purchasing a home, starting a business, or investing in one. Probably the most difficult investment decisions are those where past results cannot be used to make future predictions, either because circumstances have changed or because there are no available results upon which to project the future. The latter is especially true for startups ; these companies lack reliable facts and figures as they are, by definition, still young. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly perfect deepfakes , contributions to a better understanding of the mechanism of trust formation are poised to grow in importance. This book provides a language-related contribution to these efforts in a context where factual evidence on which to base trust is scarce.",

      "abstract": "If one wants to live, if there is something for which one wants to live, the will to live becomes a powerful force to fight the disease. The powerful will to live is intensified by the desire to create something, to discover something, to achieve something. A large number of patients who go from office to office are never improved, whatever treatment they receive. They complain about many and varied ailments. They feel weak; others can not sleep; some have pains in the legs, shoulders or back; others feel nervous and downcast. But if a disease is cured, the sick person can always somehow produce another. However, countless people carry out their work without fatigue if encouraged by enthusiasm and are interested in what they do. Physical illness is often something like an adjustment to the difficulties of life. It is a costly adaptation; but there are times when you really need to get sick: it is a truce in the struggle to reorganize your forces or to find new perspectives. There are two ways to get out of a situation that causes emotional tension: fight or flee. In almost all the difficulties that arise in life, it is not the external situation that makes us fail, but internal forces that we have not taken into account. Situations that have no possible solution are rare in life. Generally, we fail to discover the solution because it is one that we are not willing to accept: to make a positive adjustment.",

We listen to prepare our responses, whether to tell our own story or to offer advice. We need to talk to others to clarify our own thoughts. Most of us are preoccupied with the rush of our own lives and give little thought to the needs of others to be heard. We listen as though we are expected to respond. When we want to be there for someone, we listen for where we can help. When we are spoken to heatedly, we become defensive and either talk back heatedly or withdraw. Our lives become empty and we do not always understand why. We distract ourselves with entertainment or busyness that keeps us from talking to each other. It takes time and effort to listen. We do not know how to listen objectively. We react. Learning to listen takes time. There may even be times when we are not appreciated for listening until we develop more skill.

      "title": "No more buts",
      "abstract": "FigureHave you ever heard this reply to a suggestion you've made: “That's a good idea, but...” Or maybe a similar response to an accomplishment: “You did a great job, but...” Did you feel your heart sink? No matter what comes before the dreaded but, it's all ruined the instant after you hear it. If we're going to promote creative, innovative approaches to problem solving and improvements—as well as rid ourselves of what doesn't work anymore—we must do away with the dreaded b word. Years ago, in a Relationship-Based Care workshop, my team learned about the power of “yes, and” as an alternative to “yes, but” and we really tried to adopt it. The habit of but is hard to shake; it took attention, diligence, and constant peer feedback, and it did make a difference. (Notice the and in that sentence.) We felt affirmation instead of rejection, which inevitably led to more brainstorming and constructive discussion. Think also about the power of no more buts in terms of performance and conflict management. Instead of quashing someone's self-worth with one word, we can let people feel heard and supported by using and. For example, you may say, “On rounds today, your patient mentioned your excellent teaching skills, and couldn't remember his meds. Why do you think that is?” The concept actually goes back to comedians and actors using improvisation in their work, building on each other's words to create stories. Ponder its application in our workplaces: a conversation that once went like this “I'd like to bring in remote monitoring as an alternative to sitters” “Oh, that's a good idea, but we tried it before and it didn't work” could go like this “I'd like to bring in remote monitoring as an alternative to sitters” “That's a good idea and I'd like to know the latest options and benefits since the last time it was tried here.” Bam, you've delivered hope, trust, and value in one sentence. If eliminating but ushers in a safe environment for more ideas, will it help promote the opposite—exnovation, or getting rid of the old and useless practices that don't serve us anymore? Here's where a but may come in handy: “Pagers may have been a good idea 20 years ago, but now they're outdated with the advent of technology.” Now you're wondering if I'm living under a rock; we can't throw out the old so easily. There are barriers, regulations, politics, budgets, and challengers. Yes, and we can chip away at all of it using our leadership skills. No buts about it, as our parents would say. Keeping old policies and practices in place forever is another habit we can break. As a gift to the over 3.3 million RNs in the United States, let's eliminate the destructive use of “yes, but” and lead ourselves to innovation through “yes, AND.” After all, innovation is one of the American Nurses Association's three themes for Nurses Week this year: inspire, innovate, and influence. Suspend the urge to keep the old. Let the fresh air in and the stale air out. We can do this!Figure[email protected]",

      "abstract": "Notions of quality, standards and accountability are ever-present in many societies around the world and, arguably, we would be hard pressed to journey through life without appeals of one kind or another to these ideas. Our everyday interactions with people and things reflect the fact that standards of various kinds abound, from the relatively uncontroversial engineering properties of materials we rely on every time we drive across a bridge or use our cell phones (density, hardness, tensile strength, shear, electrical conductance etc.) to the more contentious understandings of what constitutes quality of life or quality of care. We depend, often without much thought until a crisis of some sort arises, on standards for food safety, automobiles, children’s toys, water quality, housing construction, and the like. Similarly, we make appeals to quality norms when recognising that some accomplishments or performances are better than others (exemplary behaviour, low standard of living, high ethical character), and some things are better constructed or more durable than others and thus provide greater value for money. Organisations operate with various notions of quality as core to their business whether in the widely appealing idea of quality as fitness-for-use (meeting customer expectations), conformance to specifications or requirements, or providing assurance of access to and effectiveness of services (Reeves & Bednar 1994). Accountability for finances, for fairness, and for performance (Behn 2001) are all longstanding concerns of public agencies charged with spending tax dollars wisely in contributing to the welfare of society. We think it important as citizens in democracies to hold corporations, governments and individuals accountable for human rights abuses and adherence to the rule of law.",

      "title": "Pen down your emotions-for a better you",
      "abstract": "Sir, Being able to share our feelings and emotions appears to significantly trim down the negative physical and mental upshots of arduous life events. In this fast-paced world, wherein we live in an isolation or alienation from others, we put ourselves at stake.[1] Negative emotions can drag us down, especially when helplessness kicks in. Risks of grievous mental and physical problems awfully increase; the longer we pent up our emotions.[2] Medical professionals work in a variety of settings, wherein they have a variety of interpersonal contacts. As they interact, they need to be quite conscious of own emotions and of others to ensure that it doesn't have any impact in each one's health. The cost of unresolved emotional upheaval takes a toll on caregiver. Although in many settings, employers support caregivers through highly qualified counselors, stigma is associated with seeking support. The stigma arises of a feel that it is in the same place wherein they have to work further. Herein, the importance of nonsocial modes of expression such as writing comes to the forefront for all those who find it hard or constrained to share their emotions with others. Writing has been an effective strategy used in psychology with a view that writing could furnish an outlet for individuals to evince unpleasant emotions and psychological distress. Writing gives a safe, cathartic release valve that lets us pour out all the suppressed emotions and feelings. Engaging in writing provides a possibility to foster expressing self and improves organizational abilities in addition to observational and descriptive skills. These soft skills are pertinent to clinical thinking and medical practice. SIGNIFICANCE FOR NURSES The nucleus of nursing is to strive for improving patient's quality of life. This is usually attained by means of nonpharmacologic, psychobehavioral interventions such as writing. This can be performed when and where the patient chooses it to perform. By means of writing, patients engage in a cognitive process, reintegrating experience in life. By jotting down, individual can secernate meaning, share meaning, reach out to others, and define them.[3] This is speculative of the holistic nature of nursing. Substantial rewards have been reported for such objective outcomes as students' scholastic performance, skipping work, and performance in extracurricular activities. It is also indispensable in social and linguistic behavior of those involved in writing about emotional topics. This kind of writing had significant and long-term improvements in illness-related visit to doctor, self-reported physical health ratings, immunity, grade point average, memory, and sporting performance.[4] HOW AND WHAT TO JOT? In accordance with the previous researches, those topics that involve shame or guilt are the most apt for disclosure, as these are the ones most often inhibited. Whatever is distressing to the individual can be chosen as a topic for writing. When writing, think of the deepest emotions associated with an event and write whatever comes into the mind, regardless of the spelling, grammar, or quantity. Writing even for four consecutive days for 20 min a day has produced significant effects in the life of individuals.[5] Writing down our emotions actually gives us an insight of our inner self. No matter what the rewards of expressive writing, it should be used as a complement to standard treatment and should not replace apt medical or psychological interventions in clinical populations.

      "title": "Two: Entitled and Demanding",
      "abstract": "There are patients who unconsciously choose to remain in the realm of the paranoid-schizoid position (Klein, 1946) as a method to avoid certain conflicts, anxieties, and disappointments encountered in the depressive position (Klein, 1935, 1940). They have a meager and reluctant foothold in the depressive realm of functioning, but this is often a perverse or corrupted grasp into the yet to be reached, more mature ways of relating to self and other. These patients have become convinced of the immediate or future benefit of believing in the idealized state in which self and object are united or re-united in a special and blissful state. They believe they will be saved, fed, rewarded, or finally bestowed special blessings and love that are owed to them.So, to give in to the whole-object world of the depressive position means to give up these visions of control, perfection, and fusion. The depressive position is not a world of love you because you are perfect and you love me because I am everything you wished for. It is a much more mixed bag of love you in spite of your flaws and you love me despite my problems. The patients investigated in this chapter instead want to continue on a childhood treasure hunt and are determined to find the pot of gold and the rainbow that leads to it. The nature of the psychoanalytic process is extremely difficult for these patients as it means they must give up this treasure hunt and realize that no matter how long they sit at the bus stop, there is no magic bus coming to pick them up. These patients dread the awful disappointment that comes with the reality of life, the often less than special status of life as life, without any magical cure or reward. The patients examined in this chapter use multiple and complex defensive strategies to force reality to bend to their wishes, be it an active or passive stance, a masochistic or sadistic move, a pleading and dependent cry, or a demanding and independent approach. As noted by Scharf fand Scharff (1992), some patients who face the anxieties and loss of the depressive position attempt to jump over it into a manic state of control, thus eliminating concern, loss, difference, remorse, or sadness. Due to these kinds of radical attempts at self-preservation and competitive hunger, many of these individuals terminate treatment prematurely or create a variety of treatment impasses. They are in a psychic standoff that often is played out in the transference and can greatly affect the counter-transference. Strong demands, either explicitly or subtly, are made of the analyst to instantly fix and heal. The patient insists on retaining the illusion of being great, special, or deserving to avoid a sinister, primitive state of persecutory loss.OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT AND APPROACHIn the moment-to-moment transference situation, the patient is either actively engaged or actively disengaged with the psychoanalyst on many levels. This aliveness or deadness within the total transference situation (Joseph, 1985) and the interpretation or non-interpretation of it is what can define a treatment as either analytic or non-analytic. The interpretation of the current state of the transference as well as the patient's phantasy experience of the object world (rather than interpretation of the past or external matters) is critical in general (Joseph, 1989), but even more so when the patient's phantasies, transference stance, and defenses have begun to shift the treatment into something less than analytic. Certainly, the analyst's own counter-transference enactment of projective identification dynamics or personal conflict can escalate this problem. Overall, the resulting loss of analytic contact (Waska, 2007) often occurs within the more interpersonal realm of the analytic relationship.The ways a patient tries to move the treatment away from analytic contact to something less object-related, less relational, less affect focused, and less self-reflective are numerous. …",

There may still be room for apartness, solitude and quiet contemplation (as much room as other commitments will allow) but generally we want to be with that person and we want to share things with them: activities, laughter, sex, time. We see them in the light of our own past as well as in the light of what we know about their past and, above all, we see them as unique and irreplaceable. They are beings whose loss would cause us to grieve and, at least in part, our grief when faced with their actual loss results from the fact that the everyday desires and concerns that we have for our own well-being have become entangled with our desires and concern for their well-being; the one has become bound up with the other. This is what sharing a life with someone is like. The prospect of never seeing them again, never being close to them again, is truly dreadful.

      "title": "Individuality and Loyalty to Truth under Tyranny",
      "abstract": "Individuality and Loyalty to Truth under Tyranny George Kateb (bio) a person can be loyal to a principle or betray it. a common criticism leveled at someone in authority, or in a position where people look to him or her for guidance or inspiration, is that this person has betrayed a principle that he or she had professed allegiance to and usually upheld but now, in especially difficult circumstances, has abandoned. My chief concern is with loyalty to truth, to the principle of seeking or holding on to the truth in difficult, indeed unusual or unprecedented, circumstances, where serious personal and external obstacles to understanding the truth exist. I am disposed to believe that only a small number of individuals in such circumstances can maintain loyalty to this principle. The burden of truth is always likely to be carried by only a few individuals, who thereby earn, in my judgment, a complex kind of honor, which I will try to delineate. I impute to these individuals the capacity for inner freedom; specifically, inner freedom of mind, which is necessary if loyalty to truth is to be possible, when one's responses to the conditions of society militate powerfully against seeking or holding fast to the truth. For a few persons, betrayal of truth would feel like a self-betrayal equivalent to suicide, to a loss of self. Let us notice that every conscious loyalty is to a principle, but not all principles are abstract as, say, an intense commitment to truth is. Yet when a principle is not abstract, it is nonetheless likely that imagination helps to shape it. So loyalty to family, for example, although it might begin in what seems to be instinct, will become under duress a conscious affirmation or rejection. The idea of the family [End Page 607] must play a role in the process by which loyalty to the principle of family solidarity emerges or endures betrayal. Correspondingly, the imagination helps to constitute loyalty to a country; or, at least there is no instinct to it. To be sure, there are many pragmatic concerns that sustain it, but the imaginary, even in the form of fantasy, often permeates pragmatism. Since I promote the concept of the inner freedom of individuals and tie it so closely to a commitment to truth in extraordinary circumstances, I wish along the way to place this concept in relation to other concepts of individualism, especially two others: democratic individuality and care of the self. From the perspective of loyalty to truth-seeking and truth-remembering as the highest loyalty, inner freedom is the kind of individualism that is central. This means that democratic individuality, the concept that I have tried to promote since the 1980s, can no longer figure in certain kinds of speculation about the future, nor can Foucault's idea of care of the self. However, in reflection on the present condition of society, the concept of democratic individuality still has work to do. If inner freedom of mind is an uncommon achievement, perhaps one should also say the same about care of the self and, almost paradoxically and more disappointingly, about democratic individuality. The almost insuperable obstacle to these kinds of individualism, when they are present as cultural possibilities, or any other kind, is the ease with which people everywhere fall into group identity. Ethnicity, patriotism, religious affiliation, nationality, race, and color are, singly or in combination, widespread forms of intense group identity. Individuality cannot coexist with strong group identity, which substitutes itself for reflexive and active personal identity. To think of oneself as, above all, a member of this or that group means that the group is the most important fact in one's life; group membership defines all the cultural possibilities of the self in the world. Such membership, which begins in imitation and often remains submerged beneath full consciousness, seems to give definitive answers to troublesome questions about personal identity and also makes the [End Page 608] questions it purports to answer the only questions about a person's identity that can possibly arise. Group identity hides existential questions that it does not want to recognize or is even afraid to recognize and makes...",

      "abstract": "Stress can either help or hinder one's effectiveness depending upon the stress level. When the level increases, personal effectiveness increases but, when the stress crosses the optimum level, the persons’ effectiveness declines. Too much tension in the string also yields very poor result and may break the string. A group can also be a potential source of stress. These group stressors can be categorized into three areas. They are lack of group cohesiveness, lack of social support and intra individual, interpersonal and inter-group conflicts. Among individual factors contributing to stress are personality, life and career changes and lift trauma. Job stress is becoming a day to day problem for many of our life. It's all because of the fast world evolution. Everyday we have to cope with the fast life and change ourselves into machine like objects. There is no time for relaxation, no time to take self care, no time to spend with our own family, no time to play with our children. All such agony's can accumulate and form a stress. Major causative agent for stress creation is our work place. Many of us always think about our office and sometimes bring office work to home also. Then there is no time for mind relaxation, so automatically a stress is created.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor:\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the issue of retirement is often a case of “the grass being greener on the other side.” When we are very busy with our profession, at least once a day, all of us think of the day when we could retire, relax, and do all of those things that we are not able to do right now due to a lack of time and due to our commitments. Retirement, pursuing our hobbies, spending time with family, taking up a just cause – all of these seem very alluring.\r\n\r\nOnce we are retired, within a few months the novelty of all of these things loses its sheen and we start to feel useless and purposeless. For any human being, having a purpose in life – something that gives us an identity, self-respect, pleasure, a chance to help others, and recognition in our community – is very important for survival. On retiring, very soon many people feel unwanted, for their friends and family have an agenda of their own.\r\n\r\nBeing a workaholic or being completely retired (the two extreme ends of a spectrum) are both imbalanced. And when something is imbalanced, it is bound to make you restless and unhappy. The best thing to do is to achieve some balance in your day-to-day life, even when you are young. Then, there is no question of boredom, fatigue, and daily dreams of retiring. It's only when one devotes too much time to one's profession that one starts craving to be at the other end of the spectrum, for life always seeks balance. Working very hard with no spare time, and retiring and having too much time, are both equally bad. It is my opinion that as doctors we should try and balance our lives so that the question of retirement becomes superfluous.[1]",

      "title": "Is Obedience Enough",
      "abstract": "J imagine: No arguments. No hesitation. Complete obedience. Every parent’s fantasy, right? Sure, it sounds good, but look again. Inspire obedience and what you get may be very different from what you actually want. Obedient kids may be great at taking orders, but they tend to be really weak at making independent, responsible decisions, important life skills you probably want them to develop. Lacking these skills, and the confidence to function outside your immediate influence, and your children become vulnerable to a host of problems ranging from susceptibility to peer pressure to ending up in relationships or situations in which their actual safety could be compromised. Given the choice between having their children grow up to be order takers or decision makers, most parents would select the latter. With all those influences a child might encounter in today’s world, who in his right mind would want children to be good at simply doing what they are told? Yet many of us create parenting environments that encourage just that. Despite the goal to raise independent, responsible children, we’ll usually admit that the kind of obedience described above sounds rather attractive at times. (This is especially true if we see our only other option as having obnoxious, disobedient children. This is not the case, as we’ll soon see.) It seems like it would make life so much easier, doesn’t it? Well perhaps for the moment, but not in the long run. While it may not be evident to the parent who is frazzled from repeating the same request 100 times, there’s a big catch to having an obedient child. Most of us were raised to believe that good parents have obedient kids. So why wouldn’t we encourage obedience in a child? After all, obedience is unquestioning compliance with the requests of people in authority, which is good, isn’t it? That’s a great lesson for kids to learn if the people in authority are bright, moral, caring and able to always consider the child’s best interests along with their demands or requests. But kids can give the same kind of power, value and importance to strangers, peers, dates or others who might not be quite as invested as you in your child’s well-being. Kids are often exposed to a variety of people in uncontrolled or unsupervised environments very early in their lives. It’s hard to predict which ones they are going to perceive as an authority. It’s likely to be a dedicated teacher, caring Aunt Harriet, or a concerned police officer, but it’s just as likely to be anyone who is big, strong, attractive, charming, persuasive or popular. Even well-meaning people can influence kids in negative ways. For example, what will happen when a conservative teacher tells your daughter that “nice” girls aren’t pushy? (There aren’t too many of those nice, non-pushy girls making it in Corporate America. And there are a lot of “nice,” non-assertive women being injured in relationships because they never learned they might have to stand up for themselves.) If your child is dedicated to pleasing and obeying, how well will she be able to evaluate the personal relevance of this information? What happens when Aunt Dorothy, for whatever well-meaning reason, tells your son to quit taking his vitamins because they aren’t good for him? What happens when the baby sitter tries to make your children do something they are uncomfortable with and then threatens them to keep quiet? When an older friend offers your child a cigarette? When your son’s girlfriend puts pressure on him to become sexually involved with her? When one of your son’s buddies suggests that to be a man he has to get high with the boys? When the popular crowd at school challenges your child to participate in victimizing a classmate in order to be a part of their crowd? What happens when it’s time to make a lot of decisions that will affect your child’s future and well-being and you can’t be there to direct his or her choices? Being a loving and concerned parent with the best of intentions, you probably answered those questions by saying, “I hope they’d make a good decision!” But how will they make a good decision, alone and under pressure, if they have only had training in doing what they’re told? Obedience, after all, is obedience. (And for the purpose of this article, this term refers to the tendency to respond, unquestioning, to another person’s request or command, either for the purpose of pleasing that person, or to avoid a painful consequence. Obedience to a set of internal principles or values is a whole other issue, a personal strength that rarely develops when kids grow up focused on pleasing others.) Since you cannot censor your child’s world or prevent him from encountering influences you might perceive as undesirable, why not shift the focus from encouraging obedience to arming your children with the skill and confidence to evaluate the people who can influence them? Obedience is motivated by the reaction of other people. Regardless of how righteous the authority, the authority is still the decision maker. In this type of relationship, the child’s only choices are whether or not to comply. When the child obeys, she does so either to please the authority or to avoid a negative reaction, such as anger, disappointment, punishment, shaming, disapproval, emotional abandonment or an outright verbal or physical assault. These are the techniques that most of us experienced",

Most psychoanalytically trained therapists worth their salt know this inside out. It's integral to their therapeutic being. Suffice to say that in any individual therapeutic relationship, there is a lot of feeling flying around between the two people involved, some consciously but more unconsciously. There are various theoretical ways in which we can understand our hatred, whether it be through the projection and externalisation of our patients experience into us or whether it be the terror that resides in ourselves. In the face of such extreme self-absorption in the patient, the therapist might well find himself bored, impatient, and ironically failing to keep attentive to the very selfish needs that are so pressing yet are driving him away.",

The dying process is simply terrifying; there is a fear of a loss of dignity, loss of self-reliance, and that dying will be a painful experience. This is all critically associated with a loss of control whereby the locus of control has shifted from the dying person to those who will be caring for him or her. With greater openness in society through the media, the majority of the general population wishes to have assistance to end their lives when they are close to death.

In addition to the death of loved ones, they often face the loss of independence, due in part to failing health, including eyesight and hearing.

      "title": "Safety : a commitment",
      "abstract": "Safety is a commitment; a way of life at work and at home. In the workplace and at home, the co mmitment begins wi th ea ch of us. We m ust of course ha ve t he su pport and commitment from those who direct our daily work. Likewise, we must lead by example, at work and at home. All of us have something we like to do that takes us away from routine, daily tasks. We must preserve our “quality of life” if we wish to participate in those things we like to do. A commitment, as defined in most dictionaries, is an obligation, a promise and dedication. The obligation to work safely is based in expectations we have for ourselves. It is human nature to try and avoid any situation involving pain, yet many times we take short cuts that increase the likelihood we will become injured. The reasons we take short cuts are varied but include pressure t o pe rform, recognition a nd one t hat can be a ddictive, for the adrenalin rush. The promise we make ourselves is that we are not going to be injured or hurt because we do not like pain. Particularly when we are younger, we have the feeling we are invincible. However, keeping this promise becomes extremely difficult when we lose our focus on the tasks at hand. Focus is most often lost when we are doing familiar tasks and become complacent, letting our minds “wander” or disengage. When our minds are disengaged, even repetitive, mundane tasks c an become hazardous. Finally, we must have the dedication to utilize thought processes that place our quality of life as the first priority. Such dedication will evolve i nto a lifestyle whi ch wi ll in t urn be come a foundation for establishing a culture where safe work practices and safe living habits just “happen”. In 2003, the supervisory, management and safety committee teams made a commitment at H ampton Lumber M ills Cowlitz D ivision. We committed to improving our s afety performance. We made that commitment because we believe it is our moral and legal obligation to assure we provide a safe work environment for all our teammates. Providing a sa fe work e nvironment pertains to the physical condition of our manufacturing operations as well as assuring all teammates are supported in safe work practices. We believe we have made significant p rogress in our q uest t o assist o ur te ammates to preserve their quality of life. At the end of the calendar year 2002 we had an accident incident rate of 10.88 in the Cowlitz Division. At the end of the calendar year 2005 we had an accident incident rate of 4.76. Many factors have contributed to our ongoing success to improve our safety performance. The initial effort for improvement involved, at that time, our Cowlitz Division Operations Manager, plant supervisors, safety committee members and myself, in the capacity as Division HR/Safety Manager. That initial effort began by addressing not only recordable accidents, but also any non-recordable injury, any near miss and any property damage.

They don’t have full-time jobs or mortgages or bills, and they certainly don’t have the responsibility of raising a teenager. Yet it turns out that adolescents, like adults, have plenty of things weighing on their minds—everything from grades and pimples to gangs and drugs to war and terrorism. Indeed, teens today face so many stresses and pressures that a little worrying now and then is perfectly normal and realistic. It’s only when the worry grabs hold of a teen’s mind and won’t let go that there may be a serious problem. The hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is exaggerated worry and tension that are unfounded or out of proportion to the situation. Teens with GAD always expect the worst. They worry about all kinds of things—schoolwork, appearance, money, friends, health, the future, and their performance in a wide range of situations, to name just a few common concerns. This state of constant, gnawing worry lasts for months or even years. After a while, it can start to take a harsh toll on a teen’s mental and physical health.",

La imposibilidad o dificultad para abrazar desemboca en soledad, soledad en multiples formas y versiones, soledad ante la ausencia del Otro en su forma mas proxima. \nAsi, podemos decir que concluiremos con una revision de las posibilidades de la Ausencia: por un lado, ausencia como oportunidad para tomar conciencia de en que consiste realmente la proximidad; por otro, ausencia como calvario de un existente que aun demanda abrazo, caricia, cuerpo.",

There are many transitions which happen without any shelter: some of them have been through very hard infancies, marked by the need of being precociously autonomous and responsible, other marked by solitude and abandonment, by the capability of care and careful attention, vigil. There are adolescences marked by the fragility and adolescences marked by the fracture of the family environment, of the social context where the poverty, the conflict and the lack of hope had already swallowed the future of the new born.\r\nIn the latest years Julia Kristeva has often spoken, in a worried way, of the (French and European) adolescents underlining how they are “the weakest ring where the bond among human beings appears disrupted in the collapse of the social pact”. And it’s worrying that in many of them there is space to a death wish, in its different forms, as a tragic and paradoxical answer to their need of belief. The transition to adult life is always an experience of uprooting and a discovery of the other. It has often been said and written that the very young meet coldness in the society around them, they do not perceive a presence of strong and significant bonds, they do not feel a blessing upon them, a blessing which is “a promise and a custody”.\r\nA way to recover the blessing is to establish relationship with suffering people, with unrecognized people. Through these experiences, these meetings we can experience a reciprocal blessing, just in the uprooting, in feeling on the margin.",

In our correspondence we want to acknowledge the following: that what is getting overwritten through communal and multi-perspective experience is always more promising (not yet better!) than what vanished the moment when it mismatched (our individual) ideas and lost its capacity of sense-making. Our conversation is a plea for considering mental images as going through a process of “getting born,” consolidating, dominating, corrupting and eventually losing any (convincing) agency altogether. Such a consideration is never free of devastating frustration, deep disappointment and the possible darkness of depression darkness of depression but has the power of freeing us up — moreover — freeing us from previously functioning ways of doing and thinking. Those ways might have held something in our place that freakishly doesn’t make sense in other places.

      "title": "Half Empty or Half Full?: Sociological Self-Explorations of An Aspiring Realist",
      "abstract": "As I reflect on my life and notice how much I have been affected by my surroundings, I realize that I often talk a lot like my father. My father is a pessimist, as judged by many of the statements he makes. As for me, I also tend to be a pessimist, even though I'd rather call it a realist. I look at the facts the way they are and state things the way I see them. This may make me appear pessimistic on some topics, but optimistic in others. In other words, I'm not a complete optimist on some things and I am not a pessimist on others. However, as I observe my life I often catch myself saying statements that would almost exactly sound like how my father would have stated them. Even when my optimistic nature comes out, I soon begin seeing things in a pessimistic light. I realize some of this have to do with the impact of my father's statements and actions on my life. My pessimism can range from those on topics such as economics and politics to even conversations about household issues. My mother, in contrast, is a lot more of an optimist than my dad and I. She is always finding the good in any situation. I find it peculiar that I often become self-conscious of and take on my dad's pessimism compared to my mom's optimism. I don't necessarily want to be so pessimistic at times because sometimes I feel as though it isn't the best way to approach things. Other times, though, I feel like it is the only way to handle situations. As I have progressed through this course, learning more and more about the social world, various ideas seem to shed light on and explain why I am more a pessimist than an optimist. Sociological mindfulness' is an absolute necessity for me in order to understand why I feel this way about my life. According to sociologist Michael Schwalbe sociological mindfulness is the practice of tuning-in to how the social world works (3). This is exactly what I have to do to understand my pessimist attitude toward life. Schwalbe goes on to argue how rare this sociological mindfulness is because of several reasons. One in particular is that many people don't believe that they can really make a difference in the world. Schwalbe states, Some smart and caring people withdraw from the world because they do not believe they can do anything to change it. They feel so powerless, as do many in our society (5). I feel this way a lot because of my attitude toward many different aspects of my life. I am so focused on the negative than the positive aspects and possibilities that many times I feel as though I am saying What's the point? If I wanted to reverse this way of feeling I should truly study the social world and grasp aspects of my life. I will then not be as pessimistic in every part of my life. As I analyzed my issue further in relation to the various chapters in Cahill and Sandstrom's book, Inside Social Life: Readings in Sociological Psychology and Microsociology, more and more aspects came to light of my pessimist attitude toward life. One basic consideration is that everyone goes through socialization. Whether or not it is primary socialization where you learn the basic principles of life in the intimate context of your family in your early childhood, or secondary socialization when you enter the world in order to make your various impacts on the world, every single person goes though it. As I was going through my socialization I always strived for the best, whether it was in school or at sporting events. As I got to college I had to give up one of the most important aspects of my life which was playing the game of soccer. I grew up with soccer; it was my own way of secondary socializing with other individuals. Then I came to realize, because of my pessimistic mentality, that I had to give up the sport to find a job to help with the financial strains of college tuition. Even though I feel as though I have continued socializing through my life and transitioning into my new job, the experience of giving up the game of soccer, which is one of my true passions in life, severely impacted me. …",

At any given period we find ourselves with many desires or preferences, yet we have limited resources, and so we cannot satisfy them all. Our limited resources include insufficient economic means, of course; few of us have either the funds or the material provisions to obtain or pursue all that we might like. More significantly, though, we are limited to a single life and one of finite duration. We also age, and pursuits that were possible at earlier points within a life may become impossible at later stages; we thus encounter not only an ultimate time limit but episodic limits as well. Because we must live our lives with limited resources—material and temporal—we are pressed to choose among and to order our preferences. Without some selection and ordering, few if any of them would be satisfied, and we would be unable to live lives that are recognizably good at all. Moreover, we would be unable to function well as the autonomous beings that we are. Our practical task then is to form a coherent, stable, and attractive ordering of aims—to develop a conception of our good.",

In other words procrastination means putting off important tasks to a later time. Procrastination is easy to do but hard to stop. This can be proved a major problem in your career as well as in your personal life. People sometimes attempt to control their procrastination habit by setting deadlines for them. Procrastination does not only attack one's quality of work or health, it makes one appear to be lazy and uninterested in his or her job. Procrastination also leads to the failure of accomplishing one's dreams. Procrastination is a cruel mistress that appears wonderful from afar, but the closer one gets to her the harder it is to escape.

The second part is helping one another add value to the relationship and the world. In this chapter we focus on the bonds we have with people close to us: family, friends, and fellow workers. If you want to experience mattering in a relationship it is essential to express, and not just think, positive things about your loved ones. If you want to matter in the inner circle you don’t have to avoid conflict – you just have to know how to handle it. Healthy relationships are characterized by effective management of conflict, not by the avoidance of it, as it is all but inevitable. Many people stay away from conflict because they think that it is the end of the world. They close up, shut down, and avoid addressing the conflict, leaving neither party satisfied. But well-managed conflict can lead to intrapersonal and interpersonal growth and to a stronger relational bond.",

There’s a general feeling of impotence fostered by some lack of care to the simple things in life. Behind the school walls a lot of people get sick, living with so much indifference. But... if education is a possibility of caring, of human encounters, why do we attach ourselves to non-encounters, to conflicts, to power disputes? Why are education professionals getting sick? What is aching? These questions started to surround us... and through some years of experiences, observations and studies some hunches appeared. The educators/managers/caregivers, through years, has been dedicating much time of their lives to care about each other, and as time passes they feel directly how painful is not taking care of of themselves. They also feel the indifference of the public policies to education and its professionals. Unsatisfied with all this frame of suffering, and knowing that sometimes we heal our pains taking care of each other, we created the project School management under the principle of caring. We wished the educators/managers/caregivers could recognize in themselves humans who need care; that they allow themselves to live the experience of taking care of themselves personally first to then take care of the others. Moved by circle dances, dialogic experiences, sensitized hearing, through intense encounters taking care of the caregiver, we could meet some surprises... and that’s what we want to share in this text.",

      "abstract": "When a person is diagnosed with a condition leading to vision loss, life cannot go on as before. As well as developing new ways to manage their daily activities, people must manage the shock to their identity and decide how they now wish to present themselves. These add to the cognitive load of people with who experience vision loss over and above that of their sighted peers. Our qualitative interview study used a thematic analysis to explore the experiences of people with a condition causing vision loss to understand the work they undertook to integrate this diagnosis into their identity (or not) and to decide how and when to communicate their vision loss to others. People often navigated between identities: their identity prior to the diagnosis, and \"the blind person\" – an identity forced upon them. Linked to this, but a separate task, was deciding how they wished to present themselves to the world – to fully acknowledge their disabilities, to completely cover them, or to choose a path between these extremes. Self-presentation also depended on the audience (family, friends, colleagues, strangers) and this decision was not a single event: most people faced the necessity of repeating this process many times as their vision fluctuated or circumstances changed, and the cognitive effort this required exacted a toll. We build on the work of the disabled identity, identity continuity and self-presentation theory to describe the experiences of people managing their sense of self when faced with the uncertainty of deteriorating vision and deciding how to present themselves to others. This work requires considerable cognitive effort, adding an additional cognitive penalty of disability to those already coping with the practical difficulties of vision loss.",

      "abstract": "• A friendship goes sour, and you can hardly tolerate someone who was once a close friend. • A colleague who once rankled you becomes your most ardent supporter. • A beloved relative did the unthinkable, and you furiously sever all ties. Whether it is love or hate, we tend to be “all in” with our strong emotions. We operate under the 100 percent rule, believing someone is totally terrible or totally wonderful. Yet the rule is not really a rule at all; it’s a fallacy. It misleads us. Citizens from countries once at war become friends. Beloved associates fall from grace and become nemeses. Swings in friend­ship can cause us to adore or detest wholeheartedly. Reality, however, provides the wisdom to question whether someone is ever totally unlovable or unhateable. When we see the 100 per­cent rule for what it is, a narrow view through a narrow lens, we can step back and consider a more balanced perspective. We can take another view of others and ourselves. Many different thinkers have told us that “what we resist, persists.” The more we resist something or someone, the more we strengthen that thing’s or person’s effect on us. We detest a co- worker; that emotion ties us to her. We believe the secretary snubs us; we begin spotting her other faults. We look for behav­iors to confirm our opinions. And we are so certain of our opin­ions that we often find that evidence, whether or not it exists. Letting go of our animosity frees us from negative thoughts and behaviors that can deplete our emotional health. We see our foe as unlikable, unlovable. Yet someone likes him. Someone loves her. Someone genuinely loves that person. Severely negative portraits we hold of others can fester like an abscess on our psyche. Are we willing to release someone from the 100 percent rule? Are we willing to reframe our perceptions? Imagine how it would feel to rid yourself of that infection. When we use our power to soften assumptions and broaden images, we contribute to our own good health. We release others’ hold on us. And we know someone loves them. We all know difficult people.",

Things are vastly changed since the passions of those who were strong by station or by personal endowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security. In our times, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, every one lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship; Not only in what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the individual or the family do not ask themselves—what do I prefer? or, what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow the best and highest in me to have fair play, and enable it to grow and thrive? They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and circumstances superior to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is customary in preference to what suits their own inclination. It does not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary. Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke : even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they like in crowds; they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes ; until by dint of not following their own nature they have no nature to follow: their human capacities are withered and starved : they become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own….",

      "abstract": "The cognitive abilities and emotions of homo sapiens lead to the desire to establish control over the temporality of its being, yet this desire collides with the randomness and transience human life. To live a human life is means mastering two opposing scales of time: the lucky and prosperous days versus the unfortunate and traumatic days. Both the individual as well as the collective can experience fundamental negative turns i.e. traumas, which directly cause personal or social instability, risk and uncertainty. Human beings have basic psychological needs for trust, security, order, love, approval, belonging, Self-actualization. When something happens that sharply undermines the fulfillment of those needs people feel traumatized, betrayed and become distrusting. The traumatizing event may partly or fully shatter identity and disrupt the continuity of awareness of the actor, who must launch the process of recovering and stabilization. Coping with trauma entails a series of narrations and discussions encouraging the resurgence of individual or collective memory for rebuilding an appropriate identity and making past usable. The renewal of identity mostly lies in becoming aware of a new, unusual way of bridging the gap between the present and the past, a special positive mode of discussion about events too uncomfortable to remember. For empirical analyze the idea of dialectics of trust and trauma in human lives we use a collection of biographies of Estonians narrating their stories through several rapid political collapses.",

      "title": "Nurturing our ideas",
      "abstract": "BRENDA S. GREGORY DAWES Was there ever a time when a new protocol or change in practice was directed, and you said to yourself, “I thought of that idea ages ago?” Your idea, which might have generated improvements and changes, did not get captured at the time you thought of it, so it did not become a reality. Acting on an idea in a month or a year is not as important as catching the idea when it presents itself and turning it into a plausible solution. Creative thinking is becoming more crucial as traditional methods of doing business fail. Creativity probably is one of the most important personal and business strategies for survival and success in our complex world, which has a multitude of issues that need solutions. In perioperative settings across the country, we continue to deal with unsolved issues (eg, unexpected cancellations or additions in the surgery schedule, turnover times, the need for productivity measurements). These age-old problems result in even more tribulations that add to our daily stress. Natural creativity becomes more difficult to accomplish as we experience the ups and downs of life. People sometimes are frustrated by the creative blocks that occur when they are stuck and cannot get a new idea or solve problems. Even when a new idea strikes, they are fearful of ridicule or criticism. They cannot accept that their efforts will not pay off if they never try. We all have attended meetings or sessions where games are played to encourage people to open their minds to new ideas and thoughts. These games, however, will not generate creativity if we do not allow ourselves that release. As children, we possess a creative spirit that lets us see things without boundaries. Then, however, children are taught to color within the lines. They sometimes experience criticism or embarrassment when their actions do not meet a certain level of expectation. Rules, procedures, and rote learning become a mandatory requirement and diminish the creative spirit. As adults, daily pressures sap our energy to the point of losing any creative whim. To maintain personal and professional creativity, it is important to retain and incorporate childlike qualities into our lives. Creativity is stimulated when you are able to see life from more than one perspective. Being able to separate ourselves from routine responses and behaviors helps us see and experience things differently. The human mind is a complex organ that can provide full understanding if we can explore what might seem unreasonable at the time and seek new perspectives. Alliances with other individuals expose our talents and creative inventiveness. Unfortunately, competition has increased to the point that potential partners and relationships often are overlooked as an opportunity for growth in this area. Today's technology also can interfere with forming solid alliances, which can stifle excellent ideas. Mingling with others and sharing ideas increases the information exchange and possible generation of new and unusual viewpoints. There are two types of people who use their creativity to turn ideas into reality—those who come up with ideas and those who come up with ideas and make them happen. After ideas are generated, the key is to turn them into goals. Selling ideas, handling objections, and getting a commitment require persistence. They also require the willingness to reevaluate an idea as it relates to responses. A creative idea is not necessarily a bad or inappropriate idea, but it might not be right for the time. If you have not opened your mind to creativity recently, I challenge you to explore the options you have to offer. If a persistent problem nags at you, question your own efforts and those of others to improve the situation. Creative efforts take time from a daily schedule, but what you discover might amaze you. Keeping a journal or diary, using free association techniques, learning something new each day, or seeking a challenge at least once per month are a few options that might help you develop a creative spirit. Most importantly, learn to relax. Find ways to separate yourself from the work environment and daily problems so your mind can open up to new options. If you believe you are creative but others are not receptive to your ideas, it is important that you recognize the barriers. Did you prepare and present a plan? If that plan was not accepted, did you reevaluate the plan, timing, or outside resources that might be needed? Did you align partners to help you fulfill the commitment so the plan would work? If the plan did not work, does that mean it is not a good plan, or does it need to be revised or presented at a future date? Creativity can add insurmountable benefits to the work setting. Presenting a creative idea can improve your beliefs about what can and should happen and how to approach problem solving. Forcing yourself to look at a situation that seems difficult and putting your creative talents to work could provide needed solutions during these difficult times. Our current health care settings are crying out for improvements and solutions. You can develop the creative spirit within yourself to become the person who finds new ideas and turns them into reality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The author reflects on life lessons drawn from a varied career in business, government service, and education. Examples of meaning and purpose are drawn from interactions with individuals ranging from a Morgan Stanley banker to Mother Teresa. Topics such as loneliness and isolation are explored, and statistics are cited about recent suicide rates. The author notes that “after four decades of working closely with leaders, observing them and listening to their deepest thoughts and concerns, I have distilled the pursuit of meaning and purpose into eight practices.” In brief, those practices are (1) know and live your own story, (2) maintain deep connections in your core relationships, (3) regularly express gratitude, (4) learn to forgive and serve, (5) define success and failure for yourself, (6) make sure risk continues to play a role in your life, (7) integrate your life, rather than compartmentalizing it, and (8) work to leave a legacy for others. Solitude is also essential and provides the space to reflect upon our lives, relationships, challenges, and blessings. Solitude differs from loneliness. Solitude fills our hearts with gratitude and renewed energy for living. Loneliness kills our very souls and often spirals into sadness and despair.",

This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "Coleridge's Capable Negativity in 'Dejection: an ode'",
      "abstract": "Coleridge's Capable Negativity in 'Dejection: an ode' Andrew Keanie Throughout his career, Coleridge often indulged his negative emotions memorablyand minutely: It is a most instructive part of my life, that I have been always preyed on by some Dread, and perhaps all my faulty actions have been the consequence of some Dread or other on my mind / from fear of Pain, or Shame, not from the prospect of Pleasure / – So in my childhood & Boyhood … imaginary fears of having the Itch in my Blood – then a short-lived Fit of Fears from Sex – then horror of DUNS, & a state of struggling with madness from an incapability of hoping that I should be able to marry Mary Evans (and this strange passion of fervent tho' wholly imaginative and imaginary Love uncombinable by my utmost efforts with <any regular> Hope – / possibly from deﬁciency of bodily feeling, of tactual ideas connected with the image) had all the effects of direct Fear, and I have lain for hours together awake at night, groaning and praying – then came that stormy time / and for a few months America really inspired Hope, & I became an exalted Being – then came Rob. Southey's alienation / my marriage – constant dread in my mind respecting Mrs Coleridge's Temper, &c – and ﬁnally stimulants in the fear and prevention of violent Bowel-attacks from mental agitation / then <almost epileptic> night-horrors in my sleep / & since then every error I have committed, has been the immediate effect of the Dread of these bad most shocking Dreams – any thing to prevent them / – all this interwoven withits minor consequences, that ﬁll up the interspaces – the cherry juice running in between the cherries in a cherry pie / procrastination in dread of this – & something else in consequence of that procrast. &c … 1 The above notebook entry illustrates atypically choking efﬂorescence of Coleridgean unhappiness. Taken at its face value, Coleridge's 'procrastination … & something else in consequence of that procrast. &c' meant that the poet considered himself incapable of producing great poetry. The point presents itself as a question: how should Coleridge's wealth of poetic activity in later years be regarded, given that he pronounced 'The Poet … dead in [him]'2 in 1801? I do not wish to state categorically whether or not the composition of 'Dejection: an ode' should be thought of as marking a decisive turning-point in Coleridge's career, shaping all his future activity (or inactivity); nor do I wish to decide whether or not the poem should be thought of simply as an important episode, only partially related to what came before or [End Page 281] after. To do either would impose on me a heavier burden of proof than I am able to assume in the space available to me here.But it is worth observing that in 'Dejection', Coleridge's thinking revolved around a prodigious paradox: the fact that even as he pronounced himself dead as a poet he was at the same time exhibiting his continuing poetic life by his verbal facility and imaginative play. With J.C.C. Mays's argument in mind, that Coleridge was capable of making his negative emotions poetically 'viable',3 I will argue that 'Dejection' involves the ﬁrst conscious, explicit and formal enactment of what I will call Coleridge's capable negativity, which shouldbe compared, but not confused, with Keats's negative capability.4 I will concentrate on the version of the poem published in the Morning Post, 4 October 1802,5 because, in my view,it marks how Coleridge ceremonially discontinued competing with Wordsworthas a poet,6 by displaying publicly his essential difference from (and possibly his superiority to) Wordsworth, despite the latter's productiveness. 'Dejection' is not simply the gesturing of a poet who is really dead. What, if anything, died? One may be inclined to answer that question with a shade of decadent humour if one recalls J.K. Huysmans' character, des Esseintes, hosting a sombre, formal 'dinner in pious memory of the host's (temporarily) lost virility'. Like Huysmans' knowingly 'regulation phraseology [in des Esseintes'] letters summoning relatives to attend the obsequies of a defunct kinsman',7 'Dejection' has an oddly persuasive life of its own. The paradox...",

Para afrontar una perdida es necesario crear un espacio para la renovacion realista que pase por el reconocimiento del problema y de nuestras propias fuerzas. Solo cuando las expectativas acerca de nosotros mismos y de los demas se acerquen a la realidad, nos desilusionaremos con menos facilidad y quedaremos mas satisfechos. Necesitamos aceptarnos tal como somos, sujetos perfectibles que podemos mejorar con la adquisicion de buenos habitos como el humor para tomarnos menos en serio algunas de nuestras cosas, la aceptacion de la ayuda de otros para evitar el aislamiento y el cultivo de una red social de apoyo, porque los indices de enfermedad aumentan cuando el hombre se ve privado de la compania de sus familiares y amigos. Los que han pasado por una crisis, particularmente por un duelo, ven la vida de otra forma, sienten que deben procurar vivir el presente de la mejor manera posible, cultivar la amistad y los afectos porque en la afliccion estos no solo previenen y amortiguan su impacto, sino que son su principal tratamiento. EnglishCrisis is a part of life. When facing the loss of a loved one, it is necessary to create time for a realistic renewal through the recognition of the problem and of our own strengths. We are not as easily disappointed and improve our satisfaction when our expectations of ourselves and others are ciose to reality. We need to accept ourselves as we are: individuais that may improve with the acquisition of good habits such as humour, avoiding isolation, accepting the help of others and cultivating a web of social support. The incidence of sickness increases when a person sees himself deprived of the company of his family and friends. All crisis survivors see life in another way and learn to live in the present as much as possible, and to improve their relationships and care for their relatives and loved ones, because in times of grief, not only are these ties the main way to prevention but also they reduce its impact and treat/cure the loss.",

      "title": "Acknowledging boundaries",
      "abstract": "We all have boundaries. The limit at which our yes turns to no defines our sense of “crossing the line.” Yet others may not have the same lines. Language usage, physical contact, attire, and academic integrity are some of the categories that can incite a sense of boundary violation. Yet we have an obligation to inform. “Knowing and showing” our boundaries can help pre­vent boundary violations that embarrass and wound. What boundaries do we take to school? What boundaries do our school policies expect from us? Do we enter school with sen­sitivities toward others’ personal spaces and preferences? Are we careful (full of care) about intruding on others’ beliefs and social comfort? For some, asking personal questions, sharing private infor­mation, using profanity, and name- calling cross the lines of acceptability. To function within clear boundaries, we may need to inform others of behavior that makes us uncomfortable. Depending on our level of discomfort, we may need to esca­late our responses from cordial conversations to matter- of- fact opinions and eventually to strong “cease and desist” stances. Choosing an appropriate level of intensity makes clear our expectations for boundaries. If we do not inform others, we can­not justifiably hold them accountable for what they do not know. When we know our boundaries and when we respect the boundaries of others, we have a much greater chance of prop­erly, sensitively, and comfortably orienting ourselves in schools. Knowing and living our boundaries develops a healthy trust in ourselves. We need not be haughty or apologetic when we reveal our discomfort with words or behaviors: “I won’t cross that line.” “I can’t be party to this discussion.” “I’m exceed­ingly uncomfortable with this conversation.” “She has a right to expect that conversation to be kept private.” “I believe there are some ethical issues to be considered with this situation.” Dubious behaviors can too easily become unexamined hab­its. Once a state of mutual trust is breached, returning to that state can take time, effort, and commitment. Knowing and show­ing school- appropriate boundaries can help everyone.",

Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "abstract": "Each day brings a new set of problems and challenges. When we encounter a problem, we have to think about the different ways we could deal with it and then make a decision about what we will do or say. Sometimes we make the right choice, while at other times, we seem to get it wrong. There are many reasons why we are unable to successfully solve our problems. Decisions and choices are sometimes made too quickly. Strong feelings like anger or anxiety sometimes take over and stop us from thinking problems through and making choices about what we do or say. The main reason why we can't solve problems is because we just can't think of another way of doing things. There will be times when although children know the best way of dealing with their problems, they slip back into their old ways as their new plans are forgotten.",

      "title": "Quality of Life Philosophy V. Seizing the Meaning of Life and Becoming Well Again",
      "abstract": "This paper presents a positive philosophy of life developed to support and inspire patients to take more responsibility for their own lives and to draw more efficiently on their known or hidden resources. The idea is that everybody can become wiser, use themselves better, and thus improve quality of life, subjective health, and the ability to function. To be responsible means to see yourself as the cause of your own existence and state of being. To be the one who forms your own life to your liking, so that others do not shape it in the way they prefer to see you. Seen this way, taking responsibility in practice is one of the most difficult things to do. One of the greatest and most difficult things to do in this context is to be able to love. To be the one who loves, instead of being the one who demands love, care, awareness, respect, and acceptance from somebody else. Since almost all of us have had parents who maybe loved us too little and mostly conditionally, we all harbor a deep yearning to be loved as we are, unconditionally. A lot of our energy is spent trying to find recognition and acceptance, more or less as we did as children from our parents, who created the framework and defined the rules of the game. But today, reality is different. We have grown up and now life is about shaping our own existence. So we must be the ones who love. This is what responsibility is all about. Taking responsibility is, quite literally, moving the barriers in our lives inside ourselves. Taking responsibility for life means that you are willing to see that the real barriers are not all these external ones, but something that can be found within yourself. Of course there is an outside world that cannot be easily shaped according to your dreams. But a responsible point of view is that although it is difficult, the problem is not impossible; it is your real challenge and task. If there is something you really want, you can achieve it, but whether it happens depends on your wholehearted, goal-oriented, and continuous attempts. This paper describes the philosophy about seizing the meaning of life and becoming well again, even when there is little time left.",

      "title": "Reciprocity in Crisis Situations",
      "abstract": "Crises, by their very nature, are characterized by a feeling of being over-whelmed, as we are faced with situations that call for responses above and beyond those which we normally have to face and for which we have developed the coping skills and strategies we need to deal with them. In times of crisis we are taken outside of the “comfort zone” of our experience and competence, and so there is the potential for the sense of self-esteem which comes from that competence to be compromised if we are left floundering and unsure of ourselves. In this article I explore how reciprocity—being able to give back as well as to receive—can contribute to the rebuilding of our self-esteem, but I also suggest that its potential for empowerment is often overlooked or undervalued when there is a high level of pressure to deal with situations quickly. Those of us who work in the “helping professions” derive some of our own self-esteem from being able to competently remove people from danger or despair. If, however, in responding to our own desires to be useful and valued, we create or reinforce dependency in others by denying them an opportunity to feel valued and useful too, we run the risk of reinforcing the feelings of helplessness and powerlessness that crises can so readily engender. This article therefore argues the case for developing a fuller and clearer understanding of reciprocity and the dangers of it being neglected in the heat of the crisis moment or in the aftermath.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the experience of existential regret, defined as a profound desire to go back and change a past experience in which one has failed to choose consciously or has made a choice that did not follow one’s beliefs, values, or growth needs. The person experiences a combination of existential anxiety and existential guilt. Existential anxiety stems from confrontation with existential givens, including the finitude of past choices, inability to change the past, and the finitude of freedom in the past. With existential regret, the object of regret is an experience in which one failed to make a conscious, wholehearted choice and instead has made a choice in a moment of bad faith or lack of authentic presence and subjectivity. One’s sense is of having abandoned and betrayed the self, thereby feeling deep existential guilt. A paralysis of action and choice may follow. Distinctions, examples, implications, and recommendations are also discussed.",

      "title": "Correspondence with the Deceased",
      "abstract": "Continuing bonds, by their nature, are personal and individualized, and like imaginal dialogues of a spoken variety, can invite a response from the other. Thus, many grievers use letter writing to initiate an ongoing correspondence \"with\" the deceased, letting the conversation evolve as their life does. Others use such writing to begin a therapeutic journal, designed to branch out in a variety of literary directions. Still others take advantage of contemporary online media by opening an email account in the loved one's name to which personal messages can be sent, or by continuing to share postings to or about the deceased loved one via Facebook or other social networking sites. Although the bereaved can continue such dialogues indefi nitely, I fi nd they commonly taper off after a few months, and sometimes after a signifi cant exchange in which the client completes \"unfi nished business\" refl ected in anger or guilt in relation to the deceased. The common tendency for such written exchanges to fade over time into a more internalized dialogue with the loved one accords with evidence that such attachments take a more psychological or spiritual form as they become more secure (Field, Gal-Oz, & Bonanno, 2003), although writing may continue to prove useful on signifi cant anniversaries or other occasions as therapy (or life) proceeds.",

It is suggested that insults involve aperpetrator, a target and, often, an audience. The intentionto insult is not necessary, as some insults are theresult of misunderstanding or accident. However, theexperience of being gratuitously offended and the corresponding feelings of shame, guilt, andanger are fundamental to insults. Several types ofinsults are observed, such as exclusion, stereotyping,obliteration of significant identity details,ingratitude, scapegoating, rudeness, broken promises, beingignored or kept waiting. Even more potent insults resultfrom the defamation or despoiling of idealized objects,persons, or ideas. Different insult dynamics are noted; these include an apology, acommensurate retaliation, a disproportionate retaliationand possible escalation, a retaliation against asurrogate and weaker target than the perpetrator of theinitial insult, an affected indifference with apossible delayed retaliation, or more commonly aresigned tolerance which may fuel subsequent insults.Insults as well as retaliation and resistance to themare part of an organization's political process whichestablishes, first, lines of domination/subordination,second, finer gradations of status and power, i.e., apecking order, and third, opportunities for building coalitions and alliances.

      "title": "Conflict between Self and Society in Romen Basu’s The Tamarind Tree and Aravind Adiga’s Last Man in Tower",
      "abstract": "The desire for security, acceptance and meaningful existence has been an innermost part of human nature. The history of man reflects his journey from cave to luxurious apartments to secure better and comfortable living for himself and his near and dear ones. This quest seems to have originated from man’s fear of death – devoid of any secured place for living, man used to spend the darkness of the night under the looming dangers of getting devoured by the predators. Aligned with this central fear is an array of different fears and apprehensions – the fear of rejection, of loneliness, of joblessness, of old age and helplessness, of diseases, of carrying on bed ridden life, of financial insecurity, of rootlessness, of alienation and so on. To alleviate this fear man has turned to the institution of marriage and family and to a larger extent to one’s caste and community. With a desire to earn a respectable living man trains himself and his wards academically, socially and intellectually and targets his activities toward his self and his personal problems or orients himself to the problems of the society at large. The choice that is made ends in different types of consequences. The self-absorbed dream for betterment mostly proves to be a mirage and pushes the man into a quagmire of degeneration whereas by channelizing one’s efforts to cure the ills of the society, an environment of greater good is established, creating a life of fulfilment and happiness for one and all. This quest offers an interesting study of human character. Literature of any nation or age mirrors man’s quest for betterment in a realistic manner. The present research paper proposes to investigate the lives of characters coming from different age, backgrounds and cultures, their motives and orientations, their idea of happiness, the choices that they make to materialize their idea, their engagements and the fruits that they taste of the seeds that they sow in Romen Basu’s The Tamarind Tree and Aravind Adiga’s Last Man in Tower.",

So much of what we have taken for granted is no longer possible. Our daily life is in pieces. Our hopes and dreams are shattered and we feel disconnected from others and no longer at home in the world. Our pain cuts deeply. We sense that we can never be the same persons we were. It can seem as if our hearts are broken. A profound change in our world calls for profound changes in us. The death undermines our sense of security. The enormity of the event and the challenges it presents make us fearful and anxious. The death clarifies how tenuous our hold is on the world and what we care most about in it. How vulnerable we feel! We long for safety and stability in the midst of chaos. We want security and order in our lives. A temporary retreat from our new world can provide stabilizing refuge-a time and place to feel and express our grief and be comforted. It offers an opportunity to take stock and ready ourselves to shape, and move into, a new order in our lives.",

      "title": "Being a beneficent observer",
      "abstract": "Beneficent observers reframe others’ behaviors to become more open to a range of possible meanings. Instead of assuming rudeness, we consider that the other person has a har­ried schedule. Instead of assuming coldness, we consider that the other person is painfully shy. Instead of assuming insult, we consider that the other person has no idea this is a sensitive topic for us. Instead of assuming disrespect, we consider that the other person knows little about our classroom expertise and achieve­ments. We choose to think “What else could it be?” rather than assuming a deliberate affront. When we are beneficent in the ways we see others, we change how we feel about and speak to them and the ways we speak to others about them: 1. We contribute to our own sense of calm and stability, our own good health. 2. We feel less like an adversary and more like a strong, compas­sionate, generous- of- spirit member of the school community. 3. We let them be them without taking on the negative views we have of them or that they have of us. 4. We essentially demagnetize ourselves. We are no longer pulled into others’ drama. We leave their anger, jealousy, and rude behaviors with them. 5. We realize that our own thresholds for tolerance and pre­ferred behaviors may be causing our suffering more than any intentional action by the “offending” person. 6. We are willing to give the other a moment of grace and the benefit of the doubt to see behavior as simply that: behavior 7. We devote ourselves to helping rather than hindering goodwill. 8. We ask ourselves: “What could I say, do, and think that mod­els compassion?” 9. We sometimes offer a silent benediction to those who rankle us: “May you be well, may you be happy, may you be free from suffering.” These habits of mind happen neither quickly nor easily, but they are worth the effort, inch by inch, step by step, healthy habit by healthy habit.",

      "abstract": "As persons, beings with a capacity for autonomy, we face a certain practical task in living out our lives. At any given period we find ourselves with many desires or preferences, yet we have limited resources, and so we cannot satisfy them all. Our limited resources include insufficient economic means, of course; few of us have either the funds or the material provisions to obtain or pursue all that we might like. More significantly, though, we are limited to a single life and one of finite duration. We also age, and pursuits that were possible at earlier points within a life may become impossible at later stages; we thus encounter not only an ultimate time limit but episodic limits as well. Because we must live our lives with limited resources—material and temporal—we are pressed to choose among and to order our preferences. Without some selection and ordering, few if any of them would be satisfied, and we would be unable to live lives that are recognizably good at all. Moreover, we would be unable to function well as the autonomous beings that we are. Our practical task then is to form a coherent, stable, and attractive ordering of aims—to develop a conception of our good.",

The same attributes that make heroes appear strong also make victims—who lack them—appear weak: a soft or feeble physique, small size, a lack of experience, intelligence, wisdom, wealth, offices, or special skills. Victims cannot protect themselves or maneuver in the political realm or other strategic arenas. They must be good, and are therefore also innocent. Victims can arouse pity, horror, and indignation in audiences. But those very emotions can make them seem something less than human. Victimhood creates a gap between viewer and viewed, objectifying the victim and freezing her outside the possibility of will or reasoned action. They lack agency. Victimhood is thus a risky self-presentation, as with victims of rape or abuse who are sometimes criticized for not having done enough to save themselves.",

      "title": "Tired of Being Tired: Managing Auditory Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Harry meets a friend but after an hour, he wants to sit alone in the quiet for a while. Beth goes to a doctor's appointment and by the time she leaves, she is ready for a nap. Carter goes to an event with family. As the event continues, he finds it more challenging to understand what everyone is saying and starts to daydream. These people likely experienced auditory fatigue. Auditory fatigue is real and is experienced on occasion by many people with hearing loss, whether deaf or hard of hearing in one ear or both, or whether their hearing loss is mild, moderate, severe, or profound.www.shutterstock.com. Auditory fatigue, listening break.WHAT IS AUDITORY FATIGUE? Auditory fatigue presents in many ways. It can be challenges with paying attention. For others, it may be the feeling of being tired or unable to listen any more after a listening effort. Some experience a strong desire to be in a quiet space or away from other people or sounds. Auditory fatigue can happen regardless of age and is experienced by infants, children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Auditory fatigue may be known by different names, including listening fatigue, ear fatigue, concentration fatigue, or cognitive energy fatigue. WHY DOES AUDITORY FATIGUE HAPPEN? When you have a hearing loss, your brain uses more areas to try to make sense of the sounds and words you are hearing and to figure out the words you did not hear. Your brain works harder to hear and understand a message if it is not clear or if you are listening in noise. The brain has a heavier processing load to figure out messages that are missed, tuning out noise in the room, and other listening tasks. The brain works harder to hear and understand and that increases stress and the feeling of fatigue. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I EXPERIENCE AUDITORY FATIGUE? When you are fatigued, whether you are aware of it or not, your body responds. Some changes are hidden, such as increased cortisol, a stress hormone, but there are some warning signs that are easier to identify, including: headaches, especially after listening increased feeling of stress after listening increased feeling of being tired or wanting to be in quiet after listening challenges with concentrating as a conversation continues challenges with performance at work or school, especially at the end of the day. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF AUDITORY FATIGUE? In children, fatigue is associated with reduced performance in school, increased absence from school, sleep disturbances, and changes in social relationships. For adults, fatigue is associated with higher need for sick days at work and health complaints such as headaches, and increased stress hormones. People may experience these adverse reactions due to auditory fatigue and not know auditory fatigue exists or recognize that their fatigue is due to listening. WHAT CAN BE DONE? Recognize auditory fatigue is real and consider auditory fatigue when you notice changes in the behavior or energy of yourself or of someone, adult or child, who is deaf or hard of hearing. Recognize the warning signs. Anticipate it and prevent it when you can. PREVENTING AUDITORY FATIGUE Use appropriate amplification, which reduces listening effort. Consider assistive listening devices which can improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Consider using captioning and speech-to-text services. Strategically select where you sit by situating yourself near a key speaker or those you most want to hear, and away from noise sources like music speakers, kitchen noise, and heating and cooling systems. Plan listening breaks. WHAT ARE LISTENING BREAKS? Listening breaks are times when you are not accountable for what you are hearing. These can be times spent in quiet without others talking. Length varies by individual but may be effective even after a few minutes. Listening breaks can be helpful in advance of listening situations such as a break before an appointment, a quiet ride to work or school, or a rest before a party or social situation. Listening breaks can be built into a lengthy noisy situation by planning a few minutes of quiet into a work or school day, such as a quiet break before lunch and recess. Adults might take a brief step outside as appropriate in a meeting or social setting. After events, plan for some down time, such as going straight home after an appointment versus a noisy restaurant, time after work or school to decompress before evening activities. Such breaks may only need to be a few minutes to achieve rejuvenation, though some people may require more time. By acknowledging, identifying, preventing, and managing auditory fatigue, people who are deaf and hard of hearing may increase their ability to participate in activities longer, stay more engaged, and feel better after.",

      "title": "Some Bad",
      "abstract": "Abstract Despite its virtues, empathy-induced altruism can at times harm those in need, other people, and the altruistically motivated person. Specifically, it can hurt those in need when acted on without wisdom and sensitivity or when a cool head is required. It can produce paternalism. It is less likely to be evoked by nonpersonalized, abstract, chronic needs. It can be a source of immoral action, leading us to show partiality toward those for whom we feel empathic concern even when we know that to do so is neither fair nor best for all. Indeed, when our behavior is public, empathy-induced altruism can pose a more serious threat to the common good than does self-interest. Finally, it can at times jeopardize our mental and physical health—even our life. Any attempt to call on empathy-induced altruism to build a more humane society needs to take these problems into account lest we do more harm than good.",

      "abstract": "For rewilding projects to be successful, individuals will need to personally rewild and connect or reconnect with all sorts of other nature from deep within themselves. The feelings that arise can then go on to lead to various sorts of actions and reactions on behalf of the nonhumans who are involved. That’s what rewilding from the inside out and rewilding our hearts is all about. Compassionate conservation plays a key role in successful rewilding projects. Along these lines, killing nonhuman animals ‘in the name of rewilding’ or ‘in the name of conservation’ in general should not be an option. Each and every individual matters because they are alive and have intrinsic or inherent value. One individual’s life should not be traded off so that another individual of the same or another species may live. I fully realise that in some places I am penning some broad and general statements that will raise many different and difficult questions, and on occasion some reader’s hackles. However, space does not permit me to do much more, and frankly, I am sure that many of the queries and including disagreements, will make for better discussions in the future that will help heal our wounded planet and its inhabitants.",

Addiction and drug use are only a side show activity—merely a way of evading the problems of every day living. With drugs, the user finds a way of escaping, conforming, or rebelling. There must be an emphasis on self-reliance and the courage to be imperfect and not live by the curse of perfection. Also, there is nothing wrong about the mobilization of inner resources but we must not only turn inward but also outward especially since we are socially embedded. The need is for equality and mutual respect. The promise for our salvation and growth is in social cooperation. Although we may have no control over the vicissitudes and circumstances of our life we do have control over our reactions to these circumstances. Thus, each person with his freedom of choice chooses between alternative actions. One can choose a life of Walter Mitty who finds daydreaming more exciting than real life or search for a Walden Three.",

Both sentiments are fundamentally concerned with maintaining a public appearance of power or importance. A person has honor to the extent that he occupies a socially recognized status by which he can expect to be taken seriously by others, either as a potential compatriot or as a competitor. To feel shame is, in its most basic forms, to be painfully aware that this status has been threatened or compromised, if not altogether lost. Such shame involves a sense of the diminishment of our self‐worth through the thought that we have been exposed to others as appropriate objects of derision, contempt, or pity ( see Self‐Respect And Self‐Esteem; Worth/Dignity). A disgraced person is no longer someone who can be admired, loved, or feared, but only something to be turned away from and forgotten.",

The client's newly emerging story—previously untold even to himself—consists of a seemingly endless series of rejecting messages of how you are is unacceptable, don't be that way, beginning on the first day of kindergarten. Many sessions were needed for him to register the full impact of receiving that message from all quarters throughout his life; to directly feel how terrifying that message actually has always been for him; and to become mindfully aware of his own self-protective strategy—\"I must not be myself, I must not reveal myself\"—that had shaped his personality from outside of awareness. His success at shedding that strategy and that fear of being visibly himself is an inspiring story of resilience in the face of lifelong societal homophobia.",

But people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may spend many hours a day checking and ordering/arranging. This behaviour arises in an attempt to counter the anxiety provoked by intrusive thoughts about, for example, harm happening to themselves or their loved ones, or about chaos in the workplace or at home. These obsessive thoughts or images and so-called compulsive behaviours may become so extreme that they take up a significant number of hours per day, cause terrible distress and significantly interfere with normal life. For individuals with these symptoms, it may feel like no matter what they do, they just cannot get rid of them.",

      "abstract": "Why do I go from one relationship to another without finding what I yearn for? Why am I restless or critical with those I love - and uneasy with my own company when I'm alone? Is it possible to be close to someone else - and still be myself? Being alone. Relating to others. Both have the potential immense personal satisfaction. Both can seem painfully elusive to balance - or achieve. As Stephanie Dowrick, a writer and psychotherapist, shows, intimacy and solitude are not opposing experiences. They are different expressions of our same self. We cannot usefully address our difficulties in relationships without also considering how we spend our time alone. Nor can we take on self-awareness in any meaningful way without questioning what we expect from others. Solitude is a very different experience than loneliness, and sex is only one way to express intimacy. In understanding our self, we must explore the roles of men and women. In understanding how to care, we cannot ignore who and how we desire, and where we look meaning. Bringing intimacy and solitude together allows each of us to unravel why we need others and want to be free; why we want to be understood and guard our secrets; why we want to be loved for and yet may have difficulty accepting who we are. Intimacy and Solitude is a self-discovery book with a rare breadth of insight, and a gentle insistence that we can and must take responsibility ourselves in order fully to express our care and love others. Dowrick draws from a wide range of psychoanalytic and spiritual sources to trace the development of the capacities to be comfortably alone and with others from infancy onwards. But as Dowrick emphasizes through a variety of moving, personal stories drawn from her own and others' experiences, no matter how far from ideal our early experiences were, nor how fearful we might at this moment be, to the end of life it remains possible to develop the self-acceptance essential to solit",

As children they are asked to disavow reality: to live as if they were born to the adoptive parents who raise them and to repress their yearning for the lost mother and father whose identity is denied them. To survive, the adoptee splits. He/she forms what I call an Adopted Self, which is made up of a False Self and a Forbidden Self. The False Self tries to adapt to what is being asked of it, at great cost to its own integrity. The Forbidden Self, the self that one must not express, goes underground to seek authenticity in fantasy or rebellious behavior. Adoptees may shift back and forth between their false and forbidden selves while growing up. To become whole-to form an authentic sense of self - they must be able to integrate the truth about their lost heritage with their adopted identity.",

As people age, they amass obligations. Callings mean, by definition, mounting entanglements. To agree to this job or to love this or that person means suddenly bearing unexpected duties. Unexpected callings can also emerge at any time of life, however, when duties arise within callings that they didn’t anticipate but must assume, often imposed from outside themselves. The chapter explores what it means to assume unexpected callings, discerning not just desire or talent but the need for service. It considers how to maintain the fine balance between self-care and appropriate sacrifice or sacrifices that are chosen and motivated by love, not forced, that rest on communal support and grace, and that require practice over time.",

When in love, for example, or when supporting a particular religious or political doctrine or party, one can readily become disillusioned if the focus of one's love or support brings about unwanted outcomes instead of promised ones. In the long run, the benefits of temporary disillusionment, in the form of “lessons” to guide subsequent projects, are often felt to outweigh the costs, in the form of emotional pain, even if these costs are high owing to the energy invested in the illusion. In contrast, chronic disillusionment appears to offer no benefits, since, for the sufferer whose life space is engulfed by hopelessness, change seems impossible and learning pointless.",

Those who have been chronically traumatized sometimes have internalized a painful dialogue that makes their emotional expression flat and lifeless.

By ‘faith’ I have in mind the attitude described by William James: Suppose … that I am climbing in the Alps, and have had the illluck to work myself into a position from which the only escape is by a terrible leap. Being without similar experience, I have no evidence of my ability to perform it successfully; but hope and confidence in myself make me sure I shall not miss my aim, and nerve my feet to execute what without those subjective emotions would perhaps have been impossible. But suppose that, on the contrary, the emotions of fear and mistrust preponderate; or suppose that…I feel it would be sinful to act upon an assumption unverified by previous experience,—why, then I shall hesitate so long that at last, exhausted and trembling, and launching myself in a moment of despair, I miss my foothold and roll into the abyss.… There are then cases where faith creates its own verification . Believe, and you shall be right, for you shall save yourself; doubt, and you shall again be right, for you shall perish.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "abstract": "When young persons, aged 16–18, had the possibility to write in their own words about fear, this resulted in a wealth of short accounts concerning just about anything and everything from dog poo to murder. In this article, I focus on the fears of sexual abuse. This is done because it seems that the ways to write about this kind of fear are quite limited, at least if the accounts focus on fears of sexual abuse in the future. This script is spelled out 'I am afraid that I will be raped by a strange man when I am out on my own, and there will be no one to help me, and I will feel ashamed, although I know I should not'. On the other hand, if the account is about fear originating from something in the past, the script is the opposite. Now the actor is known—it could be a neighbour or a classmate. And the alleged abuse takes place in someone's home, in daylight, in an everyday situation. The borders between these types of accounts and the different contents make it possible to draw the conclusion that they are constructed by and construct different discourses. What it is possible to write about in one's account and 'still be a boy or a girl'? What does this result tell us about what kind of questions are suited to be put to youngsters in surveys that focus on fears of sexual abuse, abstract or concrete ones? My suggested answer is that the more concrete the question, the more possible it is to have accounts that seem to be outside the most narrow discourse on fear of sexual abuse. Maybe it is possible to let this alternative discourse of perpetrators of sexual abuse challenge the main discourse.",

The day admitted had an anxiety disorder was the first day of a new life for me. am ready to free the emotions that lay trapped in my mind and have haunted me to this day as an adult. In his essay titled Why Is P Afraid to Love a Woman (2002), Peter Dai reflects on a personal dilemma he faced while growing up. He describes how if no one knew he had anxiety they would think he was self-confident and self-assured. also was able to conceal my fears and anxiety. Peter spoke of the surge of tension that went through his body when he was around girls. Similarly, there would be times when would black out because situations became so difficult to handle. just turned off. would sweat in class dreading that a teacher might call on me and would not be able to answer. had a choking feeling when took a test, and my grades reflected that stress. How can a person effectively take a test when they can not hold a pencil, can not breathe, and can not focus their eyes? It was impossible. All of these symptoms had become normal to me. My anxiety peaked when arrived at SUNY Oneonta. felt the pressure of success and began to realize strive to please others, not myself. felt the need to fit into some niche on campus. There were sororities and fraternities all around campus. felt uneasy when walked around campus. The bar scene was an uncomfortable experience for me as well. soon became afraid to go out to the bars for the fear something bad would happen. This led to my Agoraphobia which has lasted almost two years. My mother thought that it was awkward that a twenty-year old college student would stay home on Friday and Saturday nights. was terrified to leave my home or dorm room for the fear that something horrible would happen. missed out of a lot of great experiences in college because was afraid to tell anyone that had anxiety attacks. did a great job of hiding my anxiety in front of my friends. always had an excuse for not going out; I have a lot of work to or I do not feel well were most common. When did agree to go out would get excited thinking that everything was going to be great. But the excitement did not last long. would become very agitated and soon a choking feeling would surround me. was unable to swallow and felt short of breath. The problem continued to the point where dreaded going out to eat for the fear that would have an anxiety attack in the middle of my dinner. have lived two lives. One is the confident Megan Murray who can handle anything that is thrown her way. The second is the Megan Murray who was afraid of the world and broke down at the onset of stress.

Back stage was angry inside, always thinking of who could blame for the latest crisis was facing. felt that my identity was missing. was never confident of myself and who was. Identity is the one thing that makes each of us unique and was unable to establish that. connected with the movie we watched in class on Multiple Personalities in that felt like was two different people. was a child at heart who was afraid to be alone and make decisions; and yet, had another self who could take over when things became difficult. …",

His contemplations of the deaths he encountered as a child add a level of spiritual meditation. Like Spinoza’s free man, the narrator aspires to think about life, but is stuck with memories of deaths of friends and family members: suicides by hanging, shooting, drowning, a stillborn child, a child who dies from illness. For the narrator, life is more frightening than death. Holding on to the Christian beliefs that his grandparents turned to amid the chaos of China’s twentieth century, the narrator counts himself among those who admire death as an aspect of God’s sublime wisdom. By sharing his memories of death and desire under a regime where these topics are not always speakable, he hopes to move a little closer to freedom.",

      "title": "Ecological Trust",
      "abstract": "A ConfessionWhen I was a child, I lied to my mother about something. It matters little what it was; I can't even remember. What is seared into my memory is the acute helplessness I felt when she informed me that I would now have to earn back her The idea devastated me, in part because I did not yet know how I earned her trust in the first place. The process was foreign to me. It was difficult for me to fathom what trust-earning would take. All I knew was that it would require a sincere effort, and that it would probably be a long time before the bond of trust that I had carelessly broken was forged again. My mother was disappointed in me. Even more, she said she could no longer rely on me, and the resulting affect burdened me in a way that I had never before experienced. Our lives afford us many opportunities for such carelessness, disappointment, and betrayal. Relationships bear within themselves these possibilities-some more than others. But it is not just human relationships, or even the relationships between living creatures, that carry the fragility of trust within them. Trust is a much more universal bond, and one that we often take for granted. This essay will illustrate some of the ways that trust crisscrosses our lives unbeknownst to us.Of course, my mother's disappointment in my dishonesty probably seemed more intense than it actually was. In retrospect I can see that she was teaching me a lesson, not so much about lying, but about trust and reliability, as well as their significance and danger. What I could not see then-too worried as I was about my own fate and my mother's esteem for me-was the dimension of vulnerability that lurks within the bond of trust. When someone puts their trust in you, they open themselves to disappointment, manipulation, exploitation. To trust is to put your fate or desire in someone else's hands, precisely not knowing what they will do with the entrusted. It would probably be overstating the case to say that my dishonesty took a risk with my mother's vulnerability, or that the white lie I had told put her in a more precarious position. It remains true, however, that I manipulated her. And this was made possible by my mother's fundamental ignorance about who I was and what I might do with her trust. Trust is not only an ethical phenomenon; it is also an epistemological problem. It is a problem of knowledge that is at once a promise, a promise of security or of danger. It is as volatile as any promise, and just as precarious.Most disturbing to me was the realization that someone was relying on me without my knowledge, that they were invested in me in a way that placed them in the position to be disappointed, manipulated, betrayed, or harmed. Someone was vulnerable because of me. Someone was invested in my reliability and I had no idea. Even in our most intimate relationships, trust can remain hidden.A Thesis About Trust in the AnthropoceneTrust is often regarded as a distinctly human phenomenon. My contention is that while trust in other persons is without question important to civil society and human flourishing, the reach of trust extends throughout the entirety of the human and nonhuman world. In fact, on a daily basis we place our trust much more in things, in objects, than we do in persons. Most of the time we are profoundly ignorant of the extent of our trust, which means that we are largely unaware of the extent to which we have invested the security of our wellbeing in the world and rendered ourselves susceptible to its accidents. This is the necessary condition of ecological life, however; it could not be otherwise. I will refer to this pervasive and unknowing trust in animate and inanimate objects as ecological trust. An understanding of ecological trust requires us to think the personal, institutional, as well as interobjective forms of trust, along with the dangers attending each. It forces us to recognize our inescapable ignorance of just how prone we are to the contingencies of existence, whether broken promises, faulty infrastructure, or metaphysical instability. …",

By hurting, it reduces its victim to profound depths of anguish.

      "title": "Confident leadership",
      "abstract": "FigureHow many New Year's resolutions have you thought about for 2017? I don't know about you, but some of my resolutions start out full of positive intent and never quite make it to the finish line. Here's something we can all stride into 2017 vowing to embrace—confidence. Yes, confidence. Not confidence that's arrogant or built on unquestioning inflexibility in our opinions; rather, true self-belief in our abilities and contributions. This is integral to successful leadership. What does confidence look and feel like? First, image and impression matter, including stance, eye contact, demeanor, and ease with written and spoken words. These capabilities may seem like a tall order, but they're absolutely doable... and half the battle. And we haven't even touched on knowledge and skills yet. Combine nonverbal and verbal poise with solid comfort in your content, and you can't help but be confident. What if you don't feel self-assured and are afflicted with \"imposter syndrome?\" High achievers can sometimes be full of self-doubt, not believing that they're capable when faced with new challenges. You can do it! It's quite doubtful that you're actually living the Peter Principle (rising to the level of your incompetence). You wouldn't have been promoted or given the opportunity to lead if you didn't already demonstrate the skills. You don't have to be a genius or perfect—both lofty self-expectations of high achievers. Having room to grow shouldn't fatally rattle your self-reliance; ideally, it motivates learning and can be a positive force. Recently, a consultant told me that if I could only pick one leadership development topic for managers, it should be sales. Sales? That's a job I thought I'd never want. After reflection, I realized that this suggestion was brilliant. We're actually \"selling\" every day: selling our organization's vision, goals, and initiatives to our staff, and selling our ideas to our bosses and colleagues. And what makes a good salesperson? Confidence! Knowing your stuff, having persistence, staying focused, and being able to paint the picture of why you want and need the change. A winning salesperson also loves the product while caring about you, too. These are admirable qualities. So, is confident leadership a sales job? Your knee-jerk reaction may be \"no.\" So was mine, although selling is clearly part of the role. There are myriad issues we encounter and decisions we make every day that don't revolve around selling, but they do demand sound leadership. We can't approach these issues timidly and with uncertainty, which isn't to say that as a new leader, or when faced with a first-time situation, you can't ask for help. You can be confident and questioning at the same time. Asking for team input gives your staff members confidence in themselves, and you as well. Understanding when to get help and knowing your limitations seem to go hand-in-hand with being confident, avoiding the rabbit hole of self-doubt we just discussed. Confident leaders exude positivity and courage. They believe in their teams, and those relationships make for an affirmative work environment. Their decisions are solid, their direction strong, and their approach open and welcoming. Confident leaders \"push the envelope\"—my first editorial exactly 3 years ago. My New Year's wish for all of you is to get rid of self-doubt, think big, use your \"sales\" skills for positive influence, and enjoy being a leader. Confidence is one of the factors that will help make you love going to work every day, in 2017 and beyond.Figure[email protected]",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hope lets you breathe a little easier. It gives you a chance to live a more peaceful life, one that is defined by a deep sense of trust, a strong feeling of support, and considerably less fear and worry. Hope can also help you to transform experiences of loss and rise above the gloom and doom of a death that appears devoid of honor or purpose. These might be considered valuable gifts in any era, but they are particularly prized in our time, an age of anxiety fraught with war, disease, and a host of other threats. These threats have of course been a part of the human experience since the beginning of recorded time. But things are different today. The weapons are more deadly, the spread of disease more rapid, and our awareness of danger more thorough. Moreover, these are only the more proximate or obvious sources of our unease. We are faced with other, more covert problems as well, such as diminished community, disengaged families, mistrust of institutions, and a sense of nihilism manifest in the widespread lack of faith in God or a higher power. Given all these stresses and uncertainties, is it at all surprising that anxiety disorders have become the world’s most prevalent form of psychopathology, affecting roughly one in every nine individuals?",

But this is obviously no answer at all: not only is it circular, it ignores the unhappy truth that, while intolerable conditions are common, rebellions are rare. Suffering alone is not enough; it is a necessary but not a sufficient cause for revolution. Before they rebel, those who suffer must believe, if only for a short time, that their rebellion will lead to a better life for themselves or their communities. Only in this belief can people find the courage to act, the strength to break the bonds of habit and run the risks rebellion inevitably involves. By itself, suffering will not provide this strength and courage; indeed, suffering is more likely to weaken and demoralize than to incite and inspire. Revolutions are rare because they require an unusual conjunction of suffering and hope, a sense of outrage and an act of faith.",

      "abstract": "Boredom is a characteristic of today's society. At the individual level and at the social level, the Western countries suffer from boredom. There are extrinsic and intrinsic causes that can lead to boredom. In general, the state of boredom is reached when there are no problems to solve, when the profession does not demand our actions, or when we feel disappointed in realizing that the achievements of life do not give us sustained satisfaction over time. Boredom, especially if it becomes chronic, can be considered a negative thing. But it can also have something positive. The silence, stillness and inaction that define boredom are also characteristics that define the initial state of the person before meditation. This study aims to reflect the possibility of getting out of boredom through meditation. We can abandon boredom if we start a path of personal growth through increasing attention and perception; coming out of ourselves, leaving our own reflections and thoughts, reaching personal emptying and a voluntary impoverishment of our exteriority, which opens the door to us to encounter with being.",

      "title": "... Simply Because You're near Me: Love, Chungking Express and in the Mood for Love",
      "abstract": "It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away. --Opening of In the Mood For Love And all the while it rains. On too many days it seems as though life is comprised of picking up the pieces of things gone wrong and trying to move ahead, continuing on with hope ... I had no idea that the hopes and aspirations of people could shatter into so many pieces, all of them sharp and dangerous to handle once broken. That this whole process may never end only makes each piece that much more lacerating. All around our own bodies exists a time and place wherein individuals make promises to their selves and another about the love between them, only to experience the huge complexity and daunting aura of this love directly. The ways in which one faces this complexity often makes possible which sort of love can flourish, and/or fade away. For better or for worse our promises within love--and to it--hinge upon these moments. One reason intimacy tends to shatter so easily is because we are, many of us, afraid of that aforementioned moment during which we must face and admit the equally important strength and weakness of what it is we are feeling for another person. As such, many people are afraid of love. Afraid it might leave; afraid it might stay. Above all, though, they are afraid of themselves and the fact that access to their heart now also lies with someone else--someone who sees right through them, if they indeed love that other. This perceived vulnerability could lead the most sure-footed hero to crumble under the pressure they put upon themselves. Many individuals in this present world are immune to this malaise. They can still maintain stability while in love. Many are not so immune. As our world continues to become the place it somehow already is, this latter group grows steadily. And all the while it rains. Yet there are so many beautiful moments left in the world, moments where the enduring strength of what we all share together shines through the physical and existential garbage which piles up in between us. The films of Hung Kong director Wong Kar-wai are quite sensitive to this tension: That the world becomes darker, faster and more confusing and at the same time precious moments abound, if one knows where to look. In Chungking Express (1994) there are quick glimpses of it: a stranger cleans off another stranger's scuffed high-heels in a hotel bathtub with his necktie. In both Chungking Express and another of Wong's masterpieces, In the Mood For Love (2000), forlorn individuals sway gently within a teeming, flowing crowd. They have lost out on love for the moment, and the shot composition in these sequences gives the impression that the individuals are living at a different speed than the rest of the modern world, their faces of glazed infatuation somehow thrusting them into a sort of suspended animation. These people who appear 'slowed down' are in love--for better, and often for worse. Do they move at a different speed because the nuances of love fail to fit in, or keep up with the blur of the modern world? In both Chungking Express and In the Mood For Love it is as though intense feelings of love pull the films' protagonists into a complex state, one that feels neither comforting nor disastrous. Instead, it feels like both at once. This is the enigma of love; that it can take us in both divergent directions, seemingly simultaneously. Wong's characters are pulled thusly--apart, and together--precisely because they are in love, the most complex emotional state within human experience. Following from this, Wong's films are almost equally complex because they are about love. Utter despair dances with triumph, and neither seems clearly in vision until they are gone. Lovers, or lovers to be, fumble about, trying to connect with each other. 'Coincidences' are rife in Wong's work, in strange ways. …",

You're left feeling confused, asking yourself what just happened. Sound familiar? If you are an adult, and you have been (or are currently) in a romantic relationship - that is, an intimate, non-platonic, heterosexual relationship - you will almost undoubtedly have had this experience. If you experience this situation only occasionally, it may be no cause for concern, but over a period of time, repeated miscommunications may spell doom for any romantic relationship. Sadly, we all know the heartache involved when our relationships do not Work out as we hoped. Relationship counsellors see the people who suffer from broken relationships every day, and attempt to help these people pick up the pieces and move on with their lives, by making sense of what went wrong. How odd that something as small as not washing the dirty dishes, or leaving your socks on the floor when you take them off, can cause a rift in a relationship.

This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Life itself mandates that human beings have an awareness of self, that is, the ability to form an identity and then attach worth to it. So performers must define themselves as persons and then decide whether they like those identities or not. Yet the human propensity to be judgmental creates a problem. In the same way that they would protect themselves from a physical wound, human beings protect themselves from self-rejection by avoidance of anything that might cause pain for the self. Judging and rejecting oneself can be a very painful experience. Under such circumstances, one may avoid taking risks, such as meeting with other people; one may find it difficult to be the center of attention or to even hear criticism. Present in the performer, these factors soon interfere with the performance itself. The performer has to learn to take from the person all positive strengths and qualities so as to use them in performance when necessary. “To avoid judgments and self-rejection,[performers] erect barriers of defense, perhaps[invent] blame and get angry, or bury themselves in perfectionistic work” (McKay and Fanning, 1992, p. 2).",

      "title": "Self-Compassion and the Art of Overcoming One's Inner Critic",
      "abstract": "can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. BuddhaWhile searching topics for my article I read a lot, thought a lot, but what got my attention was a write up talking about self-compassion. I am a person who's non-judgmental when it comes to others, but I am my own critic. And there are many like me. There are number of people who have problem of over thinking, rumination and anxiety, which many a times lowers their self-esteem and self-confidence. There's always a voice in the head criticizing oneself. We all develop an inner guiding voice depending on the environment we have been brought up in and it can be both positively motivating and harshly self-critical. During our early years we were conditioned by our parents and guardians. We all have learned rules of from them. Their manners, their style, with little modification. Depending on which values they lived by, we are most likely to adopt the same ones as a blueprint for understanding the world. Values are a collection of guiding principles and they determine what we deem to be correct and desirable in life (Schwartz, 1992).Values create our subconscious representational map through which we assess and rate others and ourselves as worthy or ideal. For instance, values such as responsibility, openness and respect have the tendency to strengthen relationships and provide a basis for well-being and creativity. We are likely to take the values we grew up with. If our perception of what we are does not correlate with our values, like for example our performance, if one feel one has not done well enough, one will tend to deem oneself unworthy. The subjective and self-critical perception that we have has an impact on our sense of self-worth and that determines whether the voice in our head will be kind and supportive or destructive and devaluing. Also, our perception of ourselves influences our behavior, which means we create our own self-fulfilling prophecy (Schwartz, 1992), never living up to the good enough value. This not only lowers our self-esteem and self-confidence but also compromises our well-being. We all know it's difficult to change deeply rooted values, but we can lessen the impact they have on us by learning to change the view we have of ourselves. This can be achieved through self-compassion.Self-compassion is basically accepting oneself for what you are and treating oneself with warmth and understanding. Its human nature to lose hope and confidence during difficult time and self-blame is common but during these difficult times its utmost necessary to understand and recognize that making mistakes is part of being human (Neff, 2003a). Self-compassion has three main components and it represents a warm and accepting stance towards those aspects of oneself and one's that are unpopular, disliked (Neff, 2003b). First is self-kindness versus self-judgment, second, common humanity versus isolation, and third, mindfulness versus over-identification.If individuals are self-compassionate then, when confronting suffering or failure instead of self-criticism and belittling oneself, they'll offer themselves warmth and non-judgmental understanding. This process of realization also requires one to understand that failure and difficulties are part and parcel of life, it's okay to be imperfect, everyone makes mistakes, it's something that we all go through rather than being something that happens to me alone. Self-compassion requires one to take a balanced approach towards one's negative experiences so that painful feelings are neither suppressed not exaggerated. One should not get carried away by negative emotions otherwise self-compassion will turn into melodrama and all perspective will be lost. Instead, self-compassion requires one to have the right amount of distance from one's emotions so that they are fully experienced while being approached with mindful objectivity. …",

Usually a complaint leads to feelings of guilt and shame. Shame about who you are when you are complaint-worthy and guilt because you are accused of having done wrong. A healthy way of dealing with a complaint is to take it seriously, but to experience the additional shame and guilt and view angry feelings towards the patient as bypassing emotions. This is hardly possible for healthcare professionals with an overvalued, inflated self-esteem or with a chronically low self-esteem. The way in which we deal with a complaint is of course strongly linked with our personality: do we punish ourselves for (alleged) mistakes, do we deny the circumstances, or do we appropriate them?",

      "title": "This Is the Beginning of Writing",
      "abstract": "This Is the Beginning of Writing Lauren Elkin (bio) To know that one does not write for the other, to know that these things I am going to write will never cause me to be loved by the one I love (the other), to know that writing compensates for nothing, sublimates nothing, that it is precisely there where you are not — this is the beginning of writing. — Roland Barthes, A Lover’s Discourse 1 I often come across writers I love talking about the beginnings of what they do. Why and where it starts, what gets in its way. It’s a preoccupation of the essay, you might say. A trope. I suppose I’m only now noticing it because I’m at the beginning of a few projects, trying to decide which to devote myself to first. Each has its own hold on me; each requires the exclusion of the others. If I make a decision in any of several directions, that’s the next few years of my life. I’m at the beginning of another kind of project too, a more personal one, a project of self-definition or self-assertion. It comes [End Page 641] down to asking for more than I’ve had in my marriage, wondering if perhaps what I’ve been settling for is enough. Again: my future, and someone else’s, hang in the balance, here at the beginning—or is it somewhere toward the end? There is someone off to the side, making it difficult to see what I have or could have, generating work that I didn’t count on or allow for. I won’t go toward this person, except in writing, but in writing, I am willing to go very far. I think. The beginning of writing, like the beginning of love, is a period of risk. 2 Roland Barthes wrote a whole book about being kept in a state of unfulfilled longing by his erstwhile lover. He writes that it is futile to write to this lover, because the utopia or atopia of language (as he calls it) can never bridge the gap between them. He tries anyway. Like Barthes, I do not believe that writing will cause me to be loved by this person on the side, but the attempt both reveals and conceals an impulse, a going-toward, that we all share: me, Barthes, and the side-person (that is, you). Knowing you will read what I write gives it a tension, tightens the pitch, the sail of it. This is one of the laws of physics, and desire: directionality will always condense energy. If I write with you in mind, if I know you are reading, the cast of the wrist will be taut with what I feel for you. The focusing audience: the friend, the lover, the stranger. We pitch it differently, depending on who we imagine is reading us. [End Page 642] But you’re the strangest audience of all: not friend, or not only; not lover, or not yet. You and your ambiguities, you draw me out. You make me write. “Writing for nobody? Impossible. You fumble, you stop,” writes Félix Guattari in the Anti-Oedipus Papers. For Guattari, someone known or idealized strings the lines across the page. Somebody draws them out of the writer. Spiders do something similar: when they weave, they produce their own silk as they go; they just need a prompting, it can happen in a split second and they’re off on their lines.

Or they will climb to a high point, raise their abdomens to the sky, spin a strand into the air, and let themselves be ballooned off into the world. Writing doesn’t require any more than that—a suggestion, an impulse—to weave and wrap a veil of desire around an idea, or to release a thread into the air, so the breeze might carry it off. But this impulse can also be a lack, a longing, that drives us to the page. Hervé Guibert, in Ghost Image: If I...",

Susan Omondi and Alexandra Lang illustrate why personal responsibility really is the best thing that can happen to you in life. But why don't we take our great personal responsibility? Why do we rely on the decisions of others? This book provides the answers. Personal responsibility means creating your own space. To do this, we need clarity about our needs and desires. On the other hand, it is essential to be aware of them. Only then can we take responsibility for our decisions and actions. These are the first steps from external control, the role of victim, to self-determined action. The authors clearly show you how to recognize and eliminate your inhibiting beliefs. They illustrate how you can create new freedom through small changes and expand your sphere of influence both privately and professionally. No more excuses! You decide, you do your thing",

Consider seeking professional help when you recognize that you are unhappy—lonely, depressed, anxious, agitated, distressed over difficult relationships at work and at home, stuck in your life, losing ground, losing your enthusiasm, giving up more and more often, feeling helpless and passive. A good time to seek professional help is when you wish you felt more vital and alive, more joyful and purposeful, and less down all the time. Before active therapies were available, people didn’t have the opportunities we have today to learn how to change their outlook on life but had to accept their view of the world as normal. This situation is analogous to life before the invention of glasses. You usually could get by, but life was often out of focus and much more difficult to cope with, yet normal. Normal swiftly changed, however, to 20/20 as soon as glasses were invented.",

Although a multiple might not be visibly different from anyone else, the way he or she thinks is incredibly different, at least as different as the way someone thinks who comes from a completely different culture. Many well-adapted multiples, whose parts cooperate well, prefer to stay as a community of coordinated selves rather than become a single self. They feel that they would be lonely without insiders to talk with. Alter personalities hold memories only of the experiences in the person's life which those parts have actually lived.

      "title": "PROTECTING PRIVACY IN FOREIGN FIELDS",
      "abstract": "********** The one by whom the abject exists is thus a deject who places (himself), separates (himself), and therefore strays instead of getting his bearings, desiring, belonging, or refusing.... Necessarily dichotomous, somewhat Manichean, he divides, excludes, and without, properly speaking, wishing to know his abjections is not at all unaware of them. Often, moreover, he includes himself among them, thus within himself the scalpel that carries out his separations. Julia Kristeva, 1982 And you may find yourself in another part of the world And you may ask yourself well, how did I get here? Talking Heads, Once in a Lifetime, 1980 Privacy is an ambivalent and multifaceted question when fieldwork is conducted in Africa by a non-African scholar. Assuming that the researcher makes a conscious and political choice to live among the people whose thoughts, lives, and cultural practices are being studied, the first great difficulty appears to be protecting private space and a sense of self. Shortly, though, additional questions arise about the privacy rights of others in our conduct of research and our writing about it. Each side of the privacy issue is complicated. In this essay I examine privacy questions that I experienced on various projects in Tanzania and Malawi from 1991 to 2000, most of them in the city of Zanzibar. I start, as does fieldwork, by examining myself. A number of geographers have become captivated by the opportunities opened up to humanistic geographical inquiry by various modes of psychoanalysis (Pile 1993; Bondi 1999). I do not wish to sidestep these opportunities entirely, but I also do not want to make this essay entirely about what goes on in my head, as Julia Kristeva does in the lead epigraph, mainly because I hope I am a better storyteller than a psychoanalyst. Still, fieldwork for Western-trained academics is foremost a private, inner exploration. Kwame Anthony Appiah distinguished the general strategy of Western fiction writers from that of African writers, suggesting that westerners engage in a search for the whereas African writers embark on a search for a culture (1992, 74). His conception, generalized though it is, also works to differentiate the Western field-worker, as bourgeois intellectual individualist, from how he or she appears to the surrounding city-dwellers or villagers, as a new player in a social collective. Selfishness is inherent in individuated Western fieldwork in non-Western settings, an arrogant assumption that somehow one person develops explanatory powers. One quickly learns that selfishness must give way to a sharing, an open-ended identity enmeshed in a community. This giving way of self, however, also has its limits. Certainly I have felt there were parts of my soul that I needed to hold privately out of the field of play in fieldwork. To negotiate the boundaries between selfishness and selflessness addresses how I go about casting within [my]self the scalpel that carries out [my] separations as Kristeva put it (1982, 8). The literal translation of the Swahili word used to describe a white person, mzungu (pl. wazungu), is stranger. As one of two wazungu in the Kikwajuni ward of Zanzibar city in 1991 and 1992, the stranger label remained mine until I was known by my middle name, Andrew, by what sometimes seemed to be all 4,000 people in the ward. Children were especially fond of calling out Andrew! as I walked by or rode through the alleys on my bike, and I grew fond of their voices. In ordinary life identity is, to a considerable degree, a gendered performance (Butler 1997, 258). Although we cannot control entirely how those who see us performing interpret the performance, at most times what appears outwardly is an installation of what we inwardly deem an acceptable appearance, beyond our unconscious selves: It is an act. In foreign field experiences, totally immersed in another language, this can be a performance I feel I am watching, an out-of-body experience. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

Like all self‐conscious emotions, pride is experienced when individuals direct their attention inward and make a self‐evaluation. As a positive emotion, pride occurs when these self‐evaluations result in positive views of the self, that is, when individuals realize that their current self‐representations fit with their goals for their identity—the kind of person they want to be. Thus, students experience pride after receiving a good grade, children after succeeding at a new task, and adults after finding a mate. Adults feel pride in response to a promotion at work, their child's first steps, or their partner's love. Indeed, pride seems to fuel several fundamental human pursuits: the desire to achieve, to attain power and status, to meet an attractive and intelligent romantic partner, to feel good about one's self and one's social group, and to raise successful and well‐behaved children.",

      "abstract": "Q My night and day staff members hate each other. They're constantly complaining about the conditions in which patients are left. Do you have any suggestions to improve this relationship? Hate is a strong word, and I hope their feelings aren't actually that intense. These staff complaints about failed expectations have to be addressed from many perspectives, including quality, safety, and a healthy work environment. The nurse manager can sometimes ignore a passing interpersonal staff conflict, but not when it affects patient care and staff relationships as you describe. If you have access to a facilitator to help with the team improvement process, make use of him or her. You should get the two shifts talking to each other so the conversation isn't triangulated through your attempt to solve the problem yourself. You'll need ground rules and representatives from both shifts. Staff members may choose the representatives and/or you may need multiple joint meetings. Don't let them attack each other; input must be objective, factual, and respectful. Find out what the problem really is by having staff members tell their stories. Don't assume anything or have any preconceived beliefs until you hear all sides. Surprising results may unfold, and you want to make sure you've identified the right problem(s). Maybe it's as simple as not having the supplies and linens needed to change patients, or maybe it's a failure of communication about patient needs, or maybe you have some underperforming staff. Each of these problems has a different solution and there are probably a dozen or more possibilities for failed expectations.FigureEnd with a plan. Define expectations that are mutually agreeable, as well as the feedback mechanism. Bedside shift report offers an opportunity for both shifts to do a check on patient condition and provide feedback to each other. If it's known that expectations aren't going to be met, such as after a “crazy night,” then the oncoming shift must be informed about the reason for this up front. Charge nurses and evening/night supervisors are the key to coaching and supervising, as well as communicating progress to you and the staff. When achievements are made, thank your staff with specific and timely feedback. This is a very fixable problem. Your own expectations for both staff behavior and performance must be clear. You're accountable for patient care and the practice environment on your unit; to be successful, your staff members must work with you to resolve this issue ASAP. Q Two of the nurses who work on my unit have been dating for the past year and they've recently announced their engagement. Should they be allowed to work together after they're married? You'll have to check with your human resource (HR) department for your organizational policy on relatives working together. Most likely the answer is no and one of them will have to transfer to another unit, or at least to a different shift on your unit. Some organizations even prohibit dating in the same department. The predictability of personal carry-over into the work environment is surprising; staff dynamics change, as well as working relationships. The potential for conflict or staff discomfort is high, which is what drives typical HR policy against relatives working together. For example, something as simple as coordinating time off requests can become burdensome, with resultant partiality complaints. After you've confirmed your facility's policy, your engaged nurses will have to decide who transfers. If they don't voluntarily decide, then HR will assist you and may advise based on reverse seniority. The second set of issues is whether there's a vacant and desirable position for the displaced nurse and whether there will be preferential treatment due to the situation in the event someone more senior wants the vacant position. Plan in advance to ease the transition and deal with any roadblocks early.",

Sometimes we may question our ability to succeed, get in a slump, or fall victim to imposter syndrome. Our confidence is a critical component in leading others to success. It's time to believe in yourself. Yes, you can! Being aware of how you're feeling is an element of both emotional intelligence and relational nursing leadership. Of course, being aware of how others are feeling is part of it too, but we're not focusing on others now; we're talking about you. Self-confidence, with a touch of humility and curiosity, is key. It helps to surround yourself with people who inspire you. Being around negative, punitive, or apathetic people can bring you down and erode your confidence and positivity. I know you can't avoid some of those folks who are in your immediate circle, but can you spend less time with them and more with those who bring you joy and hope? For a good shot of inspiration and learning, go to professional meetings or conferences. Listening to motivational books, podcasts, and videos helps too. Phone a friend. Reframe situations. Embrace gratitude. You need to believe in yourself and the future, and with that comes the motivation to lead others. Yes, you can. Believing in yourself is good for your well-being. Confidence and well-being influence each other: more of one usually means more of the other and vice versa. All those well-being strategies you're doing (or meaning to do) don't only benefit you, they also help you become a better leader to others. If you don't believe in yourself, your team won't either. Their achievements are hugely contingent on your leadership. \"Fake it until you make it\" may sound disingenuous but may help you convince yourself you can do it and push yourself toward success. It's one way to counteract the \"imposter syndrome\" that sets in when we feel we aren't good enough or smart enough. Set new goals, even small ones. Welcome \"failures\" as positive—you've learned from them, and they most likely generated a better you. You wouldn't be in your position if you hadn't demonstrated good work and high potential. Acknowledge what you've accomplished, revel in it, and believe in yourself. Without knowing yourself, knowing what people are thinking, and being true to your own values, it's hard to be certain of what you're doing and why. Being curious and asking questions is a way to combat feeling overwhelmed and inspire confidence in others and yourself. It takes an element of humility to be curious. Curiosity is a strength, not a weakness; although you'll find a point on the arrogance-to-humility continuum that's your sweet spot: too far either way isn't helpful for your leadership. With all the challenges you face, it's sometimes hard to stay positive and trust your abilities. Acknowledge this but don't let it take over. Replace it with a positive mindset and self-compassion while drawing on your inner strength. There's inspiration everywhere, and your team needs your infectious confidence. It takes time and practice to get there. Believe in yourself and believe in the future. Yes, you can!Figure[email protected]",

The news regularly reports acts of violence unleashed by long-festering anger, a hidden desire for revenge, or a sudden, impetuous fit of rage. Anger plays a central role in assault, child abuse, murder and many rapes, and in interethnic and international violent conflict. Of the seven deadly sins, anger is the most pervasive, injurious to self and others, and most responsible for unhappiness and psychopathological behavior. It is also inextricably linked to the other cardinal sins, particularly pride and envy, as well as to hatred, and it is regularly aroused by frustrated greed and lust.

In Middle English romances, fabliaux, dream visions and drama, untimely sleep is dangerous, with risks to reputation and/or well-being. These genres share their interest in untimely sleep as a mode of admonition, but generic expectations also shape the consequences in distinctive ways. Across these genres, an appetite for sleep, especially when linked to other appetites – for food, for drinking to excess, for sex or sloth – marks a neglect of duties (ranging from chivalric endeavour to Christian labour and prayer), a lack of perception (of right conduct or religious truths) or a lack of vigilance (against attacks or abduction). Moments where characters sink into untimely sleep shape their identities and reputations, offering readers reminders of what not to do, and exempla of the dangers of transgressing expectations.",

As a result, adolescents confront feelings of uncertainty and insecurity daily. When they enter a group, these feelings often intensify and can easily develop into paranoia. At this stage, the leader employs humor to defuse their anxiety and tension. Never use humor in anger or force humor in inappropriate moments. Teenagers are easily hurt. In addition, mocking or ridiculing a group member, by a leader or fellow member, is never acceptable and will destroy the spirit of the group. It may appear harmless but in time, attendance will taper off and the group will fall apart.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY I have said that pets can satisfy our psychological needs in a number of ways, some not especially selfish and others extremely so‐they give us physical tactile comfort, they natter us and make us feel important, they help us to drop our social facades and to be ourselves, they give us a feeling of companionship and security, especially at night, they can boost our egos as extensions of ourselves or as compensations for our weaknesses. We can gain satisfaction from showing off our pets to others, they increase our self‐confidence by submitting to our authority and sometimes, alas, they relieve our hostilities by acting as our scape‐goats‐ they pander to the tyrant in us by becoming our slaves. They also play with us and so allow expression of the eternal child inside most adults, they can play with children and allow the child to develop his fantasies and thoughts, and they can act as go‐betweens in human relationships, often facilitating the flow of emotion between human beings. Above all, pets allow us to love and to be loved‐ the experience of feeling loved and needed is the greatest psychotherapeutic service which they give to us. To each member of a family they can become something different‐another child to the mother, a sibling to the child, a grandchild to the elderly. As companions for the isolated they are particularly supportive‐ especially for the old and lonely. As psychotherapists they can be useful.",

      "title": "Voice: Some Principles of Self Healing",
      "abstract": "Viewing trauma treatment and training from a long-term, including intergenerational, perspective, elsewhere I have introduced extensively [ 1, 2] the following general principles of self-healing, designed to help protectors and providers to recognize, contain, and heal their emotional reactions to trauma, and thought that they may benefit the readers of this volume as well: To recognize one's reactions: Develop awareness of somatic signals of distress—one's chart of warning signs of potential reactions, like sleeplessness, headaches, perspiration. Try to find words to name accurately and to articulate one's inner experiences and feelings. As Bettelheim commented, \"what cannot be talked about can also not be put to rest; and if it is not, the wounds continue to fester from generation to generation\" [3, p. 166]. To contain one's reactions: Identify one's personal level of comfort in order to build openness, tolerance and readiness to hear anything. Knowing that every emotion has a beginning, a middle and an end, learn to attenuate one's fear of being overwhelmed by its intensity to try to feel its full life-cycle without resorting to defensive reactions. To heal and grow: Accept that nothing will ever be the same. When one feels wounded, one should take time, accurately diagnose, sooth and heal before being \"emotionally fit\" again to continue to work. Seek consultation or therapy for previously unexplored areas triggered by patients' stories. Any one of the affective reactions (i.e., grief, mourning, rage) may interact with old, unworked through experiences of the therapists. Protectors and providers will thus be able to use their professional work purposefully for their own growth. Establish a network of people to create a \"holding environment\" [ 4] within which one can share one's trauma-related work. Protectors and providers should provide themselves with avocational avenues for creative and relaxing self-expression in order to regenerate energies.",

      "abstract": "Optimistic people have a better insight into the positive side of every situation, they \r\nsmile more and appear accessible, confident, friendly, kind and leave a good \r\nimpression. Every bad situation or event, optimistic person attributes to\r\ncircumstances and the current situation, never their own incompetence. It seems that \r\nthe optimists are in fact true realists who are willing to accept negative feedback and \r\nto hear bad news. Pessimists attribute failures to their own incompetence, believe \r\nthat bad events will be long-term and tend to see the negative traits in other people. \r\nPessimists are more likely to feel depressed, insecure, they are unaware of their own\r\nvirtues, appear worried and grim. Because of their traits and appearance they are \r\ninaccessible, so they fail to achieve probable success. High or low self-esteem can be \r\na trait of both optimists and pessimists because self esteem is an image of ourselves \r\nthat we build through life. A person of high self-esteem has a positive opinion about \r\nthemselves while low self-esteem people underestimate themselves. Self-esteem is \r\npersonal opinion so other people can have great opinion about a low-esteem person. \r\nIntelligent people and people that are aware of their own abilities and shortcomings \r\nhave a good sense of humor, and are satisfied with their actions and themselves in \r\ngeneral. This diploma thesis carried out a research in order to examine: whether there \r\nis a connection between optimism / pessimism and self-respect and the use of humor \r\nin the classroom with teachers of primary schools; and to check whether the use of \r\nhumor in the classroom depends on the place of residence town / village and years of \r\nservice. The study found that pessimistic respondents use humor to a lesser extent \r\nthen optimistic respondents when teaching. It was also shown that optimistic people \r\nhave more self-esteem. Respondents with more than 11 years of service typically use \r\nmore humor in the teaching then those who have less seniority.",

One difficulty has to do with the limits of the situation itself: the kind of demand it addresses to people passing by.

The paradox here is that giving goes in pair with promising (to give again, to give more) and therefore, people, sensing that, sometimes don’t feel able to give at all.",

After articulating some of the main contributions to this debate, I defend the position that we are sometimes morally permitted to spend our time and resources satisfying our own interests and needs rather than using them to aid others who are in desperate need. I argue that the duty to aid the needy should not always take priority over every other end we have. Whatever else we value, we most highly value the ability and opportunity to live our lives on our own terms; this grounds both our obligation to aid others and places limits on how far these obligations ought to extend. Persons ought to respect others and fulfill their moral obligations but they must also be given the moral space to set ends and pursue those ends just because they are theirs.",

But if the mission succeeds then a range of novel possibilities may arise, and most entail risks. For at base, the leader's mission is a means to an end, a program to reinstate the emotional life that he enjoyed in his formative years. But everything comes at a cost. Success may have cost the leader dearly; there may exist little or nothing of his former life left to reinstate. If so, then he may be tempted to remain with his mission, pushing it ever further in pursuit of some elusive redemption. He may become lost in it, believing totally in the role he has created, and dependent upon the narcissistic supply it brings, all the while becoming increasingly frustrated and empty, although never knowing why.",

Their brightness, sensitivity, and idealism make them likely to ask themselves difficult questions about the nature and purpose of their lives and the lives of others. As bright children hear the evening news, they see that the idealistic world does not exist. Instead, there are stories of intolerance, assault, robbery, and murder. It is not uncommon to hear reports of people hurting or taking advantage of others.

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

Certainly, today's youth lace many difficulties and misfortunes that can become overwhelming. Far from being protected from the stressors of adult life, young people are often exposed to a whole spectrum of adult realities well before they are emotionally equipped to deal with them. Take, for example, the very real adversities of losing a friend seeing parents divorce, moving, failing a subject, being sick, not making the team, being fired from a job, and being sexually or physically abused, injured, cheated, lied to, betrayed, rejected, bullied, or humiliated all of which young people face.

      "title": "SERIES INTRODUCTION",
      "abstract": "Extract This series is built on a simple presupposition: that it helps to have a book recommended and discussed by someone who cares for it. Books are not purely self-sufficient: they need people and they need to get to what is personal within them. The people we have been seeking as contributors to My Reading are readers who are also writers: novelists and poets; literary critics, outside as well as inside universities, but also thinkers from other disciplines—philosophy, psychology, science, theology, and sociology—beside the literary; and, not least of all, intense readers whose first profession is not writing itself but, for example, medicine, or law, or a non-verbal form of art. Of all of them we have asked: what books or authors feel as though they are deeply yours, influencing or challenging your life and work, most deserving of rescue and attention, or demanding of feeling and use? What is it like to love this book? What is it like to have a thought or idea or doubt or memory, not cold and in abstract, but live in the very act of reading? What is it like to feel, long after, that this writer is a vital part of your life? We ask our authors to respond to such bold questions by writing not conventionally but personally—whatever ‘personal’ might mean, whatever form or style it might take, for them as individuals. This does not mean overt confession at the expense of a chosen book or author; but nor should our writers be afraid of making autobiographical connections. What was wanted was whatever made for their own hardest thinking in careful relation to quoted sources and specifics. The work was to go on in the taut and resonant space between these readers and their chosen books. And the interest within that area begins precisely when it is no longer clear how much is coming from the text and how much is coming from its readers—where that distinction is no longer easily tenable because neither is sacrificed to the other. That would show what reading meant at its most serious and how it might have relation to an individual life.",

      "title": "Burnout",
      "abstract": "When working in an office with someone in person, over time you start to understand their typical mood patterns and learn to pick up on certain behavioral cues that convey their current mental and emotional state. For example, you might recognize when they're stressed out or tired because of the subtleties of their interactions with others or the amount of coffee they're drinking; or you might notice when something must be going really well in their lives too. When working remotely, those cues don't exist in the same way and are much more subtle: you typically aren't seeing how someone carries themselves throughout the day, and interactions are limited to text-based messages or meetings. This can be a very good thing, especially for those who don't necessarily want to be sharing how they're feeling with those around them at work or bring attention to themselves if something is wrong. But it can also have its downsides, because when we aren't able to pick up on the fact that something is going wrong, we can't help out.",

If a person demonstrates knowledge about mind control, ritual abuse, dissociation, or abuser networks that he or she would not normally be expected to have, one need to be alert and cautious. Sometimes people \"pad\" their resumes to appear to know things they do not really know. In other cases, people know far more than they want to let on that they know. Cult insiders may want to appear ignorant of such matters. Many factors, including illness and fatigue, can contribute to forgetting. Higher-up perpetrator-identified parts in victims have been trained to have no emotions, the emotions being held by hidden child parts. Perpetrators who are in cahoots often pretend to dislike one another.",

      "abstract": "Men can become crushed under the weight of the losses involved in committing to a loving relationship with a partner, combined with the losses associated with midlife and aging. These losses generate a narcissistic sting, which can trigger a mad rush to deny, minimise, withdraw, overcompensate, desperately seek reassurance and gratification, and blame others. David Wexler illustrates how the most powerful treatment path in clinical work with men can necessitate a journey toward personal authenticity and emotional intimacy. A primary pathway out of a man's dysfunctional system develops when he accepts responsibility for his emotional distress and takes steps to deal with it without projection of blame. Men often find that the genuine authenticity and intimacy that they develop in this process are incompatible with depression and relationship dysfunctions. Get real, get close, and a lot of the other issues fade into the background.",

They have shared bedrooms, bathrooms, holidays, family milestones, meals, and a way of growing up that those outside the family can never fully understand. The bond is intense, complicated, sometimes difficult, often wonderful and absolutely irreplaceable. When death interrupts what might have been a lovely, lifelong connection, the impact is tremendous. And yet, this loss is rarely the focus of research and is not well understood or recognised within society, leaving many siblings searching for appropriate support and validation. This book gives readers the opportunity to experience the intensity of this relationship through the eyes of three bereaved siblings. Their experiences, both before and after loss, are powerfully presented using a narrative style that allows the complexity and depth of their individual relationships to shine brightly. The author, a bereaved sibling herself, artfully weaves her story throughout, adding to the richness of the text. Through these collective stories, readers are invited to explore their own reactions and reflect on the many ways siblings affect each other over the long term. Bereaved siblings, clinicians, medical professionals, therapists, social workers, funeral directors, religious leaders, bereavement groups, and anyone who supports or knows a bereaved sibling will find benefit in this book. This highly readable text will both touch and inform readers.",

But when the relationship is \"asymmetry\" between preachers and congregation, it could be lead to burnout that debilitates the spirit in preaching. However, only some preachers suffered from burnout due to the differences in individual characteristics, work environment, and emotional involvement with the congregation. Burnout is triggered by external factors and might be accumulative. This condition could be healed but it requires a long time. When this condition ignored, it can interfere with the performance and pressthemselves, their relatives and congregation.

And it touches all parts of their lives from one end of the spectrum (the more sedate employment revolution) to the other (a death-defying belief in themselves leading to increased risk-taking and little regard for authority). The increase in numbers of participants and difficulty of BASE jumping (a 'sport' that involves leaping unattached from a Building, Antenna, Span and Earth) is considered an indication of the tendency among people to take more control of their lives. The feeling of complete independence from authority figures may lead some young people to even more gratifying anti-authority stunts in the future, or perhaps may simply lead others to choose different self-controlled ventures such as self-employment.",

      "abstract": "Many people do not like to hear pronounced around them retirement and/or old age. Some dread the word; some fear the time. This is probably a reaction caused by recent development in the country whereby people were summarily' and unexpectedly retired or sudden sickness that incapacitate some individual thereby making it impossible for them to work. This subjects the individuals to unexpected old age. Apart from the unexpected, the fact that we will definitely retire from service or business is a reality and must be prepared and arranged for. But the truth is that many of us do not really take time to think of retirement or old age for business people, neither do we sit down to plan for it. I believe that every worker or potential worker and businessman know what retirement cum old age is. But because most people perhaps, being aware of it have taken it for granted, intema1ised its value and possible talk casually about it, there is difficulty to understand it adequately. Whether we believe it or not retirement/old age is a person's life and must come when it will come. Just as we prepare ourselves for employment and gainful work as an important stage in our lives, so it is important to plan and prepare for retirement because eventually we must cease to work or do business either through old age or other circumstances. And, if one magazines what most retires and their families go through or how many of ;them ide after retirement because of lack of money to maintain themselves and their dependants then one should really prepare for retirement so as to avoid such problems. Simply put, you should take care of retirement so that retirement can take care of you. If you fail to plan then you have planned to fail. A plan give you focus, it gives you targets and goals that you strive to achieve.",

      "abstract": "Thinker and writer Richard Whately once said, ‘Lose an hour in the morning, and you’ll spend all day looking for it.’ People arriving late are often stressed and find it difficult to focus. Being on good time makes you confident and allows you to prepare well.Research shows that the way a conversation starts has a big influence on the way it develops. So, make it a point to begin one by smiling, paying a compliment, finding something to comment positively on. Your partner(s) will feel good, relaxed and creative, and enjoy being with you.You’re totally involved in an activity. Time flies. You’re focused on reaching your goal. You know you’re making progress. Everything's easy, and you do not allow yourself to be diverted by any distractions. The more you practise this, the easier it becomes, and the more success you have.Studies show that it's not stress itself that defeats people; it's the fact that they do not take the time needed to recover from stressful phases. Family and friends are important, play sports, have a hobby, sleep enough. And do not constantly think of what you have to do. Relax!When someone criticises you, don't become defensive. Maybe they want you to improve? Take their feedback seriously. But learn to filter out the feedback that comes from people who want to demoralise you: avoid spending more than the minimum necessary time with them.One person alone is limited in what they can do. So spend time socialising with people. Join clubs (or form your own), go to student meetings, support campaigns that you think have a good cause etc. This will help you make new friends and meet interesting people who’ll support you when you need them.Do good for others. When you help someone or volunteer for a job, don't expect to get something for it in return. When you do something good for someone, you will make them happy, and that in turn will make you happy, and â¦ remember that, and be grateful for all the good things in your life!",

At any given period we find ourselves with many desires or preferences, yet we have limited resources, and so we cannot satisfy them all. Our limited resources include insufficient economic means, of course; few of us have either the funds or the material provisions to obtain or pursue all that we might like. More significantly, though, we are limited to a single life and one of finite duration. We also age, and pursuits that were possible at earlier points within a life may become impossible at later stages; we thus encounter not only an ultimate time limit but episodic limits as well. Because we must live our lives with limited resources—material and temporal—we are pressed to choose among and to order our preferences. Without some selection and ordering, few if any of them would be satisfied, and we would be unable to live lives that are recognizably good at all. Moreover, we would be unable to function well as the autonomous beings that we are. Our practical task then is to form a coherent, stable, and attractive ordering of aims—to develop a conception of our good.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "Remembering as communication: A family recounts its past",
      "abstract": "Remembering can be viewed as an act of communication. People remember their life stories by writing autobiographies, conversing with relatives, friends, and strangers, or even by talking to themselves. Their autobiographical memories emerge out of these varying forms of discourse. We cannot divorce the act of remembering from the act of communicating, nor can we treat an autobiographical memory as something distinct from the discourse itself. Recollections arise not from the depths of a storehouse in the head, but from a desire to communicate with others about the personal past. What is remembered and how it is remembered are functions of the resulting discourse. People remember the same episode differently when writing an autobiography, speaking to a group of strangers, reminiscing with a close friend, or conducting an internal dialogue (see Barclay, this volume; Pillemer, Krensky, Kleinman, Goldsmith, & White, 1991; Pillemer, Rhinehart, & White, 1986; Robinson, this volume; Tenney, 1989). The social conventions of autobiographical writing or speaking, the role of the audience, ordinary language assumptions, the embeddedness of meaning in context, the social interactions between speaker and audience – all shape the form and as well as the content of remembering. Othello reports that Desdemona's father \"questioned me the story of my life,\" but the story Othello remembered and told to the father was surely not so \"passing strange\" and \"wondrous pitiful\" as the tale that provoked in Desdemona a \"world of sighs.\"",

I have loved my own family life with husband and children, but have perhaps expected each of them to spend too much time by themselves; have directed the cross or cryful child to his own room, not as a punishment, but, knowing solitude to be a solution rather than a problem, have felt it the best way for the child to get back his own emotional equilibirum. I have the utmost pity for the political prisoner in solitary confinement, the earthquake survivor standing alone outside the rubble of his home ... indeed for all the miseries of enforced isolation, but I find it difficult to understand how so many people find being left alone itself a deprivation, giving way to loneliness and boredom. Enjoying oneself, enjoying working alone, enjoying the things of one's surroundings - these simple pleasures of life are perhaps the province of those who have an aptitude for solitude, a quiet addiction to it...",

In many cultures and religious traditions, December is a time for the gathering of friends and families, festivities, celebrations, gift-giving, and contributions to charitable causes. My mother always taught me that it's better to give than to receive. I'll admit that as a young child, I found that advice hard to believe. I wanted presents. Fortunately, as I grew up and gained a more mature perspective, I found that the simple joy of giving was a gift in itself. I also learned that gifts weren't limited to the material things that could be wrapped in pretty packages for special occasions. My nursing career showed me many other avenues to gift-giving that are intrinsic to professionalism. Gifts take many forms. They come from our connections to others, the relationships that we forge, the good work that we do, and the enrichment and satisfaction that result. The act of gift-giving includes mentoring, freely sharing knowledge with those who might benefit, providing support during challenging times, offering empathy and compassion even when it's difficult, and volunteering for meaningful causes. None of these benevolent actions necessarily comes with a hard-and-fast promise that a favor will be returned, that the effort will be acknowledged, or that a material reward will be offered. It may seem unfair, but not everyone will be grateful for the gifts we give. Nurses who maintain an expectation of gratitude will likely experience many disappointments in life as well as in their nursing careers. For some individuals, those disappointments strongly influence their decision to avoid involvement without a guarantee of compensation, reward, or recognition. This approach is akin to giving a holiday present to someone only on the condition that the person will give a gift in return of equal or greater perceived value. Those always seeking tangible returns on their investments might want to consider a broader perspective about what constitutes a valuable return. The best of giving doesn't involve a scorecard. The real reward is the knowledge that it's the right thing to do. So, in this season of giving and beyond, think about the gifts you can give to others as a nurse, and let the spirit move you.

      "abstract": "This article proposed there is more than happiness to life. People desire meaning. From a place with a remarkably low level of happiness a concentration camp that quickly executed most people who arrived there he observed that whether people survived or not was related to whether they could find meaning. The evolutionary perspective raises difficulties for the assumption that people pursue happiness and meaning. Being happy has no obvious or direct contribution to either survival or reproduction, and finding life meaningful offers even less. Further an article can sum up these findings as follows. The happy but not meaningful life involves seeking pleasure and satisfaction in the immediate present, getting others to do one's bidding, and avoiding stressful entanglements. The meaningful but unhappy life is a matter of striving and struggling to express oneself, to contribute to the welfare of others even to one's own detriment, guiding one's actions in the present based on past and future, experiencing the highs and lows associated with challenging involvements in ambitious projects with uncertain outcomes that involve things much bigger than oneself.",

      "abstract": "Many Baby Boomers are finding (or may be finding) themselves in a difficult transition, as they lose their jobs in this listless economy. For most of them, not yet ready to retire, finding a new, equally well-paying job in their field will be extremely difficult. How can they go through the initial disbelief, anger, sadness and fear that come with losing their jobs; and rediscover their sense of direction, purpose, security and identity? As 8,000 Baby Boomers turn 60 each day for the next ten years, this question takes on enormous proportions. Positive psychology offers many insights and interventions for individuals who are facing such a challenging time. By identifying and focusing on their inherent strengths; developing ways to reflect more deeply; amplifying their optimism; enhancing their resilience; and connecting more genuinely with others, they may open themselves up to new possibilities – discovering a new sense of purpose and meaning in their next chapter. From there, they will be able to craft a compelling new vision of themselves, connecting who they are with what happened, where they are going, and how they plan to get there. The intention of this work is to provide hope, solace, insights, and direction for individuals who are feeling lost – helping them find their own compass, pointing in a new, more positive direction.",

And rather than an acute reaction it is a chronic condition. The effects of fear are pervasive and insidious in Guatemala. Fear destabilizes social relations by driving a wedge of distrust within families, between neighbors, among friends. Fear divides communities through suspicion and apprehension not only of strangers but of each other.2 Fear thrives on ambiguities. Denunciations, gossip, innuendos, and rumors of death lists create a climate of suspicion. No one can be sure who is who. The spectacle of torture and death and of massacres and disappearances in the recent past have become more deeply inscribed in individual bodies and the collective imagination through a constant sense of threat. In the altiplano fear has become a way of life. Fear, the arbiter of power-invisible, indeterminate, and silent. What is the nature of fear and terror that pervades Guatemalan society? How do people understand it and experience it? And what is at stake for people who live in a chronic state of fear?

      "title": "Follow Your Bliss and Other Lies about Calling",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book challenges superficial ways people use the word calling, providing a revolutionary way to approach it, not as some glorified word but as a complicated, ambiguous, and even painful reality. Shallow renderings of calling in trendy self-help literature and religious circles (“follow your bliss”; “God has a plan for your life”) greatly diminish the power of the word and are not only inadequate but sorely misleading, especially given the complexity of life and the reality that callings always demand a great deal from people. Lofty expectations that a person can (or must) find the perfectly fitting job, the one and only special life partner, the ideally balanced life, or the one-time summons from God are deceptive and destructive. Calling means so much more than seeking gladness, job success, or God’s will. To truly grapple with calling requires consideration of how it evolves amid the constraints of life. Drawing on stories from memoirs, novels, cultural figures, and everyday people, the book looks at six difficulties in early, middle, and late adulthood, from leaving paths untrodden (missed callings) and running into impediments (blocked callings) to having competing callings (conflicted callings) and failing in one or more area (fractured callings) to managing unwanted demands (unexpected callings) and giving up what one has done and loved (relinquished callings). By insisting that callings have benefits and burdens across adult life, the book hopes to make the idea of calling more useful and real for all those who aspire to live meaningful, purposeful lives.",

Such a spectacle is clearly problematic. It may even be that this is the only spectacle capable of posing a specifically moral dilemma to someone exposed to it. In fact, when a spectator is faced with any other spectacle that he judges to be without interest, or even indecent, he has the easy option of withdrawing his attention: leaving the room, stopping reading, turning the television off, etc. But when he is faced with suffering such behaviour is not self-evident because in this case he could be accused, or may accuse himself, of indifference. Now, as we have seen, having knowledge of suffering points to an obligation to give assistance.

This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "abstract": "Trauma and Belief Julia Tanney (bio) We undergo a traumatic experience, such as a life-threatening accident or a brutal attack. We survive a period of relentless stress, perhaps because we are in a war zone and witness or commit atrocities. Raised by parents who are alcoholic or mentally ill, we endure traumatic experiences on a daily basis. Or, we are ignored, neglected, or treated as playthings by narcissistic parents, who themselves were ignored and neglected, and on and on through generations. To survive these experiences, perhaps we dissociate. This can take various forms. In the extreme form, we remove ourselves, psychically speaking, from the situation (because we are unable to do so physically), perhaps by adopting the role of a witness to, instead of the object of, the cruelty. In many cases, because we depended for our lives on those who brutalized us, what would have been normal reactions to our plight—fear, rage, or indignation—could never be expressed or perhaps even felt. But these emotions do not go away; instead, they become misdirected, perhaps directed at ourselves in self-harming patterns, or (sadistically) toward others who have no responsibility for our suffering. To an onlooker or therapist, it makes sense to suppose that such odd behavior is triggered by memories, but these memories are all but inaccessible to the traumatized; indeed, that is one aftermath of the dissociation. Later in life, we see the effects in our relationships with others, in addiction, other forms of self-harm, and in serious illness. In the case of early trauma, it is sometimes only by working backward from these unhealthy patterns that we can be brought to see any connection between how we now act, react, sense, and perceive situations, to what we experienced as children. In this description, the use of ‘memory’ is a clear extension from the ordinary one, because what we are counting as memories here are ‘all but inaccessible.’ A person is usually considered authoritative about what she remembers; but the justification (or criterion) for the application of the concept of memory in these circumstances is the unusual behavior of the one who has been traumatized; not her avowals or other natural expressions. A similar story could be told about the use of the umbrella concept emotion and of the particular uses of ‘fear’, ‘rage’, and ‘indignation,’ for here too a person is authoritative unless the pattern of her actions, reactions, and expressions in the circumstances are so salient that they override what she says and emerge as the considerations by which we would, if called upon, justify the applications of these terms. We extend the concepts further by basing our ascriptions of ‘unfelt emotions’ or ‘inaccessible memories’ on something other than ‘characteristic expressions in behavior.’ For the behavior evinced in both simple and complex post-traumatic stress disorder is hardly characteristic in this sense. The decision to diagnose this range of post-traumatic behavior as involving repressed memories and unexpressed emotions is at the same time a decision to extend the relevant mental concepts so as to accommodate new conditions (or criteria) that would justify their application. [End Page 351] Our ordinary mental concepts, like all non-theoretical ones and even a very large number of theoretical ones, have elasticities of significance that permit these extensions when new problems, discoveries, or considerations make it practical to do so. Is the same not true for the concept of belief? It ought to be. But, before looking into extensions of the concept, it is worth reminding ourselves how we would justify its application in central cases. It depends, of course, on the circumstances. Sometimes, I may use the expression to talk about my principles or opinions. On other occasions, when I say ‘I believe that such and such,’ it may be because I do not want to commit myself fully to its truth. (When I am willing to so commit, I will often simply make an assertion.) In less central cases, ‘I believe’ may be used, not to express an opinion, principle, or withhold one’s commitment from an assertion, but rather as an attempt to understand one’s own actions and reactions, as if one...",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "Even without Hair: Finding Myself by Letting Go in my War with Alopecia",
      "abstract": "Even without Hair:Finding Myself by Letting Go in my War with Alopecia Melissa S. Rex (bio) As social creatures, we humans have an innate sense and desire to belong somewhere and to surround ourselves with others with whom we can relate. As a child I felt as though I was far too different on the outside to fit in with everyone else. On the inside, I wanted to feel like all the other kids around me: happy, free, and invincible. That’s how I saw them anyway. Looking back on that time of my life, I realize that many of my childhood friends and classmates had plenty of their own issues, but it was never apparent to me that they had anything to worry about. It is amazing how naturally self-involved we become when we are young, unintentionally disregarding the problems of others around us and what they may be dealing with in their own lives. My own problems were deeply rooted in something so fine, so fragile, yet resilient enough to crack my very being. I grew up in the eighties when hair styling was all about volume, frizz, perms, and excess of well, everything. Everything about that time seemed to have been created with one ideal in mind—the bigger and more colorful the better. I look back and consider myself fortunate to have lived my childhood in a time when the more individually and extravagantly you styled yourself, the more fashionable you were. During this time, I felt as if I had a bit more freedom to be different than children do today. Still, no matter how seemingly free we were to express ourselves with our hair then, an excessive degree of perfection in the artfully crafted coifs could be found on the crowns of the eighties children. Toy-maker Mattel brought to us the Lil’ Miss line, Barbie started an all-girl rock band complete with enormous rocker hair, and My Little Pony dolls were so elegantly coordinated with their own flowing manes complete with matching brushes and ribbons. I had my own collection of Barbies but my time spent with them was short-lived. They all came fresh out of the box with the trademark long, shiny blond hair, yet I was more interested in creating magnificent [End Page 157] wardrobes for them and making sure the horses were fed and watered. With my younger brother and the neighbor boys I played GI Joe, He-Man with the oozing Castle Greyskull, and shot BB guns in the woods where we built forts and treehouses. I was more interested in creating and living in my own fantasy world than living in the Barbie Dream House. Everything for me seemed to always manifest and exist one end of the scale of extremes—at one end pure fantasy and at the other blatant reality. The fantasy was that I could be me inside and out without ridicule or judgment. The reality was that my hair was an issue for everyone else, and an enormous one for a small child and her tireless mother. I felt like everyone around me wanted to find a cure and fix the way I looked, but I remember just wanting to feel accepted for the way I appeared naturally. My struggles with hair began in 1978 at the early age of eighteen months when I was diagnosed with alopecia, which back then was considered a rare disease. For years, the nature of this disease was a mystery, and in 1994, a study confirmed that alopecia is in fact an autoimmune dysfunction as normal human antibodies significantly alter hair follicle development (Tobin 723–24). After I was born, my hair growth appeared to be normal and was considered so until my body began to develop a more regular hair cycle and began to display thinning and balding areas. It’s possible that I was born with congenital alopecia, which is difficult to diagnose in newborns and infants because in many cases the child’s hair is not fully developed. Some exit the womb with a full head of hair that is thin or very light in color, while others are born with...",

When I look back at my fifty-four years, I'm appalled at the proportion of my time I've passed lying on couches, smoking, dreaming, sometimes reading. Disinclined to plan, incapable of self-advancement, I've spent much of my life like a child waiting to be given a gift. My deepest wish has never been to achieve, attain to, or possess any particular object or state; instead it has been to receive something. To tell the truth, I find it hard to believe people when they claim to have a goal. Do they really want to become pharmacists, learn languages, play instruments, start small businesses? Privately, I suspect they're being disingenuous, and what they really want is to be surprised. I don't mean to complain, as so many feminists have, that I've suppressed my own ambitions in the support of those of others. I know what it is to do that, but gender has never been at the root of my condition. What I'm diagnosing in myself is a syndrome that afflicts the self-involved rather than the self-abnegating. There's a miserable sense of impotence associated with it, and an arrogant exceptionalism. It's a disease of writers and would-be writers. Kafka had it, and Walter Benjamin, and countless others too minor to mention.",

People with depression are often given labels such as: lazy, mad, lack of occupation, lack spirituality or just a matter of not having positive thoughts, focusing on their inner energy, looking inside. What everyone does not know is that within us there is only anguish, despair and loneliness. The difficulty of approaching people, the fear of making mistakes or being badly received or mistreated, the fear of asking for any information; I have faced all this over the years. And for all these experiences and overcoming, I had the opportunity to become a Facilitator of mutual help and support groups. Listening to other people's life stories, providing even minutes of joy after crying, and watching the hopelessness dissipate, all of this brought hope to my own life and made me see mental health with a new vision. With the isolation caused by the pandemic, it was as if they had taken all the people with psychic suffering and left them in the desert to fend for themselves. For this reason, mutual aid groups are like water to the thirsty. How calm on a stormy day. Like the hint of a gentle breeze to our suffering lives. Had it not been for this support received and shared through mutual aid groups, I would not have realized that, despite all the suffering, I am not alone.",

When they think that it is possible to change their destiny, they do so by uniting, organizing, consciously acting, struggling, and sometimes by fleeing away from their lands. When people think that their undesired conditions and place in the world can be changed by their actions, then hope emerges. Hope is an \"ontological need\"; we can not survive without it. It is produced in very different contexts and by different means, such as individually, socially, religiously, economically and politically. Increasing critical consciousness is helpful in creating hope in order to escape immiseration. It is also important in becoming \"hopeful subjects\" instead of falling into hopelessness.

      "abstract": "In my paper, I develop and reflect on a method that is close to writing therapy, in which writing is used to cope with difficult experiences including mental and physical illness and is partially inspired by the principles of narrative medicine. The method which I am proposing is about combining own experience with the body and with medical encounters with supernatural horror (horror movies/books/one's own horror stories) to tell a story that can ease anxiety. More importantly, to combine own experience with the body/medical encounters with supernatural horror could be a way of telling the body's stories to oneself and of translating the body language to oneself to reach an understanding (if ever possible), to cope with the body unknown, and to advance communication skills when faced with the medical personnel. To produce such a story does not mean giving in to the neo-liberal culture of an individual who is able to fix every problem on their own. It also does not mean that doctors should be released from the responsibilities set by their profession. In fact, such storytelling, such narrative competence has to do with the need of the embodied, embedded, relational, and multiple self to regain and/or maintain its agency in the flux of life in general and when opening the doors to the medical centres in particular.",

      "abstract": "When you are a teenager, pretty much everything feels like the end of the world. A change to seating arrangements in art class might signal the demise of a carefully orchestrated social strategy. A mean look on the face of a usually reliable ally might prompt a spree of self-annihilating introspection and paranoia. A fragile universe can fall to pieces with the intervention of well-meaning yet idiotic parents. The day-to-day life of a teenager involves meticulously balancing complex social hierarchies with a program of education that spans areas as diverse as cave painting, early modern poetry, and cutthroat physical competition. Failure on any level is unacceptable but success also has its pitfalls. Excelling in trigonometry might negatively impact social standing, and a high rate of social participation might have negative consequences in other areas. Every misstep is met with a painful and often times obscure punishment. One can be 'detained' for spending too long in the bathroom or wearing ostentatious earrings. Greater infractions are punished via suspension or, worse, expulsion from the carefully arranged competition that pits teen against teen in a quest to win. Transgression negatively impacts your final score which, as any well-meaning adult will tell you, can determine your future.",

      "title": "Invisible battle scars",
      "abstract": "FigureOur nation's soldiers are called on to stabilize volatile governments, assist with military maneuvers, and provide humanitarian aid after natural or manmade disasters. During these efforts, they're frequently exposed to traumatic events, such as intense combat, hostile isolated locales, and situations in which loss of life or catastrophic injuries occur. These veterans may suffer from long-term emotional distress, such as adjustment disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and survivor guilt. Anxiety and depression are also common. In fact, these disorders have affected over 300,000 veterans in the last 6 years. We know how to care for soldiers' physical injuries, but how do we treat the mental injuries we can't see? After the battle: Adjustment disorder After a combat tour, veterans may have difficulty adjusting to a life that's different than when they deployed. It can make their long-awaited return home stressful and unpleasant. They may feel as though they no longer “fit in” with their family, friends, or coworkers, and they may struggle to regain control over their life and resume a sense of normalcy.Figure: Difficulty adjusting to civilian life after deployment is common for veterans.Family, friends, and coworkers may observe that the veteran acts differently, is more socially isolative, has difficulty enjoying social functions, and struggles to resume responsibilities both at home and work. Family and friends may notice that the veteran is easily agitated. Common events that normally would've been disregarded or found humorous may now cause intense anger, and frustration tolerance may be low. When these emotions and behaviors persist for longer than 1 month after a soldier returns home, it's often a sign of adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorder is the inability to resume a social or professional role after a stressful event. The veteran may be happy to be home, but returning from the deployment may be intensely stressful and evoke feelings of anxiety, frustration, and anger. Because deployments can be for short or long periods of time, ranging from weeks to months, the veteran may return to major family changes, such as the birth of a child, the death of a parent or grandparent, or relocation to a new home or town. In addition, his or her employment status may have dramatically changed. After the soldier is deployed, roles within his or her household will also have changed. The veteran's parents, spouse, or children may assume responsibilities that he or she used to handle. After the veteran returns home, he or she may have difficulty switching back to a daily routine that's very different from the lifestyle experienced in a combat zone. Adjustment disorder can create tension between the veteran and his or her family, friends, and coworkers. After returning from combat, veterans may experience: anxiety, worry, or fear about being left behind by their family, friends, or the civilian world in general a hard time focusing at work or in school (feeling “out of it”) sadness, anger, or resentfulness over what changed while they were deployed a short temper leading to frequent arguments or lashing out at others trouble talking to or getting along with their family, friends, coworkers, or employers a sense that they don't fit in at home feelings of isolation from others (staying home alone instead of being social) problems falling or staying asleep, or sleeping much more than normal loved ones telling them that they're acting distant or they're different than they were before deployment. Adjustment disorder is often treated with counseling. This involves the veteran talking to a trained professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, about his or her problems adjusting to life at home. Together, the therapist and the veteran will develop new ways to cope with changes so that the veteran can regain more control over everyday decisions. Therapy may be one-on-one or it may entail a group of veterans who are facing the same types of challenges. Family or couples counseling may also be suggested. Depending on the veteran's situation, medication may be prescribed to help with depression, anxiety, or sleep. With time, veterans can fully recover from adjustment disorder and resume a healthy lifestyle with their family and friends. The things I've seen: PTSD PTSD can occur after a traumatic event, such as war, assault, or disaster. In a war zone, soldiers are taxed physically and emotionally because of harsh environmental exposure, separation from family, intense experiences, and observing traumatic events. These experiences can result in a cluster of behavioral and emotional symptoms caused by continuously circulating norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol (stress hormones), which sustain the body's alarm reaction to a perceived threat (see PTSD by the numbers). The parts of the brain that are most involved in PTSD are the amygdala, hippocampus, medial frontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that converts threatening events into memories. Recent research studies have shown that the hippocampus appears to be smaller in some people who were victims of child abuse or who served in military combat. Symptoms of PTSD include: alertness hypervigilance narrowed attention span nightmares loss of appetite insomnia irritability or anger a surge in heart rate or sweating when remembering a traumatic event visual flashbacks of a traumatic event difficulty experiencing positive feelings, such as happiness and love feeling constantly “on guard” as if danger is imminent feeling emotional distress when reminded of the event feeling distant from others feeling as though one's life span may be limited. In the last year alone the number of diagnosed PTSD cases in the military jumped 50%. Up to 11% of all returning Afghanistan veterans and up to 20% of all Iraq veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. Studies estimate that one in every five military member returning from Iraq and Afghanistan has PTSD. PTSD can negatively impact a veteran's return to civilian life by limiting or avoiding interactions with family and friends that were previously enjoyable. It can limit the veteran's ability to transition into a more relaxed employment role and may also cause a strain on the veteran's social support system, such as spouses, family, and friends, as they struggle to deal with the veteran's emotional fluctuations. Common pharmacologic therapy for PTSD consists of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antianxiety medications. Cognitive behavior therapy is the most effective type of counseling for PTSD. There are two types of cognitive behavior therapy that have been found effective in PTSD patients: cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy. CPT consists of 12 sessions and has been shown to be effective in treating patients who've witnessed or been victims of a traumatic event, such as combat veterans with PTSD, sexual assault victims, and refugees. The theory behind CPT addresses the erroneous beliefs that the veteran holds about the causes and consequences of the traumatic event, which produce strong negative emotions and prevent accurate processing of the trauma memory and natural emotions originating from the event. PE therapy allows the veteran to recall or relive the traumatic event in a safe atmosphere, with the goal of becoming desensitized to the event and identifying triggers that can cause anger, fear, and anxiety. PE therapy produces clinically significant improvement in about 80% of patients with chronic PTSD. Counseling for family members may also be beneficial, allowing them to identify triggers that can be avoided and healthy coping skills. In family therapy, each person can express his or her fears and concerns. By participating in family therapy, family members will be better prepared to help with the veteran's recovery and treatment plan. Ensure that the veteran and his or her family are aware of all the benefits offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that can assist in the successful transition to civilian life (see VA benefits). Surviving survivor guilt Survivor guilt is a feeling of persistent anxiety or remorse following a traumatic event that resulted in the injury or death of another. It's common in survivors of combat, natural disasters, epidemics, and among the friends and family of those who've committed suicide. Adult survivors may exhibit excessive guilt that can lead to mental health concerns, such as depression, apathy, or generalized anxiety. Survivor guilt has been linked to feelings of low self-esteem, shame, and thoughts of suicide. Survivor guilt can affect a veteran's return to civilian life by causing social withdrawal, insomnia, depression, and physical illness complaints. The veteran may be plagued by an overwhelming sense of guilt that can be paralyzing and prevent him or her from engaging in enjoyable activities. Veterans may struggle to fulfill their roles both at home and work, and they may feel like they aren't worthy of experiencing joy after comrades have lost their lives. Veterans may avoid engaging in activities at work that could result in a promotion because they feel they're “unworthy” of a positive reward. Consult with the healthcare team if you suspect the veteran is experiencing survivor guilt to ensure he or she receives a prompt clinical risk assessment and interventions. When caring for a veteran who's coping with survivor guilt: Acknowledge the veteran's feelings and recognize that these feelings are part of a normal reaction to uncommon circumstances. Encourage him or her to seek out other people for support; sharing feelings with a peer, friend, or family member or joining a support group can help with healthy coping skills. Encourage the veteran to turn his or her feelings into positive action, such as making a contribution, holding a fundraiser, giving blood, or participating in any volunteer action that serves the greater good. Formally remembering fallen service members can also help with recovery. If survivor guilt continues, the veteran should be encouraged to consult with his or her healthcare team. Common treatments are the same as for PTSD. Not all right: Anxiety and depression Anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent and unrealistic worry about everyday tasks or events. Common forms of anxiety that veterans experience are generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by chronic anxiety and persistent, exaggerated worry and tension, even when there's little or nothing to worry about. Veterans with generalized anxiety disorder feel continually worried or anxious about a range of events or activities in their daily lives and have difficulty controlling or stopping this worry. They may worry a great deal about being on time or running errands, work or school, money, their relationships with others, their own health or the health of others, and events going on in the world around them. People with generalized anxiety disorder are usually acutely aware that their persistent worry is abnormal. Along with feeling worried about a number of things, veterans with generalized anxiety disorder experience symptoms of tension, such as restlessness, feeling on edge or keyed up, being easily tired, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep difficulties. When screening a veteran for generalized anxiety disorder, ask questions, such as: “Have you been feeling continually worried or anxious about a number of events or activities in your daily life?” “Have you experienced this worry for at least 6 months?” “Do you have trouble controlling your worry?” “Do worrying and symptoms of tension slow you down or keep you from doing the things you need to do?” Social anxiety disorder is characterized by intense anxiety during social gatherings. Veterans with this disorder feel extremely anxious or nervous in one or more social situations. Although most people feel anxious some of the time in some social situations, for those with social anxiety disorder, the anxiety is strong and long lasting, interfering with doing things they want to do, such as attending major social or family events. Veterans may experience an increased prevalence in social anxiety disorder if they've been repeatedly deployed, are separated from family and friends, or experience unsteady public support for the military effort or reduced troop morale. New research suggests that waning public support and lower morale among troops may predispose returning veterans to mental health problems such as anxiety disorders. Social anxiety disorder can affect the veteran's return to civilian life by causing social isolation and unjustified anxiety about participating in any social or professional event. Without treatment, the veteran may retreat from all social interactions with family, friends, and coworkers. It may take a prolonged period of time for a veteran to be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder because he or she may hide feelings of anxiety and instruct family and friends not to disclose how these feelings are truly impacting activities of daily living. Veterans can utilize a self-evaluation assessment tool to determine if they have social anxiety disorder (see Social anxiety disorder assessment tool). Treatment of generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder may consist of cognitive behavior therapy (group or individual) and medication therapy. Common medications used to treat anxiety disorder include antidepressants, anxiolytics, and benzodiazepines. Common reasons for depression in veterans include long deployments, separation from family and friends, high-stress working environments, and increased expectations from national and international leaders. Depression can impact the veteran's return to civilian life by increasing social isolation and causing increased stress and anxiety for the veteran's social support system. Symptoms of depression include: persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” feelings feelings of hopelessness or pessimism feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness irritability and restlessness loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies fatigue and decreased energy difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping overeating or appetite loss thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts somatic complaints (aches and pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems). Treatment for depression includes medications and psychotherapy. Veterans often benefit from group counseling in which they can share their stories and current situation with others who've been through similar experiences. Healing the hidden When caring for a veteran, consider these tips: The military helps its members and families adjust when moving to a new base or post. However, this structure is often not automatically in place when someone separates from the military. The veteran and his or her family may have to find new ways to join or create a social community. Suggest strategies to increase social interaction in the community, such as attending events. The veteran may have never looked for, applied for, or interviewed for a civilian job, especially if he or she had a career in the military. For this reason, the veteran may benefit from employment preparation services, such as professional resume services, or guidance from local Veterans of Foreign Wars agencies. The veteran may experience anxiety when returning to previous employment to find his or her job role has changed. This may include learning new faces, acquiring new job skills, or adjusting to a new position. During the transition back to civilian work, many veterans also experience worry and fear about possible job loss. In the military, veterans don't leave until their mission is complete. In the civilian work sector, an employee might be expected to stop and go home at 5 p.m., whether the “mission” is complete or not. This may not be apparent to all veterans and can cause distress. Families may have created new routines during the veteran's absences and both the family and the veteran will have to adjust to changes. In the military, the environment is very structured—from living situations to food choices. The veteran often has little choice. When reentering civilian life, the veteran may find the multitude of available choices overwhelming. He or she may function better when slowly introduced to small selections. With early intervention, you can assist veterans with beginning their recovery path and initiate the healing process of their invisible battle scars.Figure. Be: aware of the benefits available to veterans.PTSD by the numbers Research on Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans found that 10% to 18% of OEF/OIF troops are likely to have PTSD after they return. In addition to PTSD, OEF/OIF military members are at risk for other mental health problems. Although studies vary widely in terms of methods used, estimates of depression in returning troops range from 3% to 25%. 62% of military members reported receiving some kind of mental health care since returning home from Iraq or Afghanistan to assist them with PTSD and depression.

VA benefits The Department of Veterans Affairs offers the following medical services to veterans: Honorably discharged veterans are eligible to receive free or deeply subsidized medical care at any VA hospital or clinic within their state. These facilities provide management of acute and chronic illnesses, inpatient surgical care, emergency services, medical screening, and counseling. Veterans are entitled to prosthetic and sensory aids, including respiratory therapy, artificial limbs, orthopedic braces and therapeutic shoes, wheelchairs, powered mobility units, crutches, canes, walkers, special aids, appliances, optical and electronic devices for visual impairment, and other durable medical equipment and supplies. Veterans who are approved for a guide or service dog may also receive service dog benefits, including veterinary care and equipment. Nursing home care is available through three national programs: VA owned and operated community living centers, state veterans homes, and the community nursing home program. Eligible veterans may be financially reimbursed for their mileage to and from medical appointments when traveling by private family vehicle or by wheelchair van or ambulance when traveling for approved VA medical care. Financial assistance is available for veterans who've been disabled as a result of their military service. The amount of disability compensation varies according to the disability rating and whether the veteran has dependents. Hospice benefits may be granted to a veteran who has either enrolled or was not required to do so and has been determined to be eligible for VA benefits. Respite care services for up to 4 weeks per year are available, which provide 24/7 inpatient care of the veteran. The 4 weeks can be taken days at a time or in a single 4-week stay. The following services are available to veterans and their spouses: In-home private duty sitters are available for veterans and their spouses who meet specific income eligibility requirements. This program pays for licensed home health personnel to stay with the veteran or the veteran's spouse if his or her health deteriorates. Bereavement counseling is available to all immediate family members (including spouses, children, parents, and siblings) of military members who die while on active duty. This includes federally-activated members of the National Guard and reserve components. Bereavement services may be accessed by calling (202)461-6530. The Vet Center Combat Call Center (1-877-WAR-VETS) is an around-the-clock, confidential call center for combat veterans and their families to talk about their military experience or any other issue they're facing during their readjustment to civilian life. Each VA medical center has a caregiver support program, which includes caregiver education and training opportunities (such as predischarge care instruction for traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury/disorders, and blindness rehabilitation) and family support services, such as family counseling, spiritual and pastoral care, and family leisure and recreational activities. The VA Caregiver Support website (http://www.caregiver.va.gov) provides tools, resources, and information to family caregivers. key points Nursing considerationsFigure When providing nursing care to veterans, consider saying “Thank you for your service.” Utilize caution when approaching veterans with PTSD who are sleeping. Announce your presence and only touch the veteran when he or she is awake and aware of your presence because the veteran may perceive you as a threat and cause injury even if he or she is semi-awake. Consult with the healthcare team if you suspect clinical depression, generalized or social anxiety disorder, or PTSD to ensure that the entire team can formulate an appropriate, optimal care plan for the veteran. Ensure that the veteran is aware of the benefits available to him or her. Ask about potential environmental exposure if the veteran has a suspicious clinical presentation, such as difficulty breathing, abnormal serum labs, or a rash. Many military members have been exposed to toxic environmental agents during the course of their military, strategic, or humanitarian duties. Common past environmental exposures include asbestos, radiation, and herbicides such as Agent Orange. Social anxiety disorder assessment toolFigureDo you feel very nervous or anxious in any of the following situations? Do you feel a need to avoid any of these situations? — Parties — Participating in meetings or classes — Talking in front of a group — Speaking with unfamiliar people — Using public restrooms — Writing in public, such as signing checks or filling out forms — Attending major family events, such as weddings, funerals, graduations, or holiday gatherings — Talking with people in authority — Dating situations — Initiating a conversation — Maintaining a conversation — Other social situation If the patient answers yes to any of the above, encourage him or her to discuss social anxiety disorder with the healthcare provider.",

      "title": "My Father, My Self Employing a Sociological Imagination to Transcend the Imaginary in Both Self and Society",
      "abstract": "Liberation, then, depends first upon the realization of the truth about our condition. --Kathleen Riordan Speeth I became angry recently when my father tried take my dog my sister's room for the night. To me, he was insinuating that I would neglect take him my own room, and allow the dog run amuck during the night. I became intensely angry at him and at everyone else I live with, though this time, I internalized the anger and said nothing. I have, on occasion, reacted in a much more volatile fashion. In reality, his decision take the dog was probably based on past instances in which I had forgotten do as needed. He most likely intended no personal slight toward me in taking the dog, and did so without malice. The perceived slight stems from my own disappointment with myself for not living up my own standard of responsibility and for allowing my actions or inactions present a self which does not measure up that which I desire be. Erving Goffman tells us that ... the individual may deeply involve his ego in his identification with a particular establishment, and group, and in his self-conception as someone who does not disrupt interaction or let down the units which depend upon that interaction. When a disruption occurs, then, we may find that the self-conceptions around which his personality has been built may become discredited. These are consequences that disruptions may have from the point of view of individual personality. (quoted in Farganis, 362) Because of the nature of human perception, and its tentative relationship reality, many of our perceptions are in part imaginary. This is because they are constructed from within a socio-historically situated biographical nexus of needs met and feelings created through our primary and secondary socializations. is imperative, therefore, for one gain self-knowledge through a critical investigation of one's own biography in order gain awareness of the imaginary aspects of the way one tells one's own story both oneself and and how it determines his or her motivations and consequent actions. Autobiography itself is a type of social interaction in which one tries influence others (Bjorklund, 17). This being true, the writer of an autobiography, in choosing what he or she will write goes through the same role taking process that goes on in any symbolic interaction. In selecting the content of the narrative the same forces apply. Life histories are accounts, representations of lives, not lives actually lived, Bjorklund adds. Our conceptions of our own lives are subject our own interpretation and definition. We define our own roles, and assume the role of the audience when we write; the purpose of the tale we tell is contingent on our perception of each. It would indeed be a nice problem in the descriptive geometry of narrative, Ralph Keeler writes, to determine the exact point where the lines of the two interests meet, that of the narrator and that of the people who have endure the narration (Bjorklund 16-17). These facts will inevitably affect the content of this very essay. The individual is the implement of change. If one can recognize the imaginary aspects of one's own perceptions and through this awareness try better form one's actions in the best interest of a definition of the situation that is grounded in the real then one will be better able discern the real needs of self and other and act in an appropriate proximity where the two intersect. By doing so one contributes the chain of individual actions that make up society as a whole in a constructive way. Therefore reduce the reliance on the imaginary in the individual is reduce the imaginary in society as well. The desired outcome of course is still a compromise between many selves and but one that is located closer the needs of the situation at the place where self and other meet. …",

      "abstract": "Conflict occurs daily in our experiences. It may be in­ ternaI or interpersonal in nature, may manifest itself in confusion, frustration or depression. Helping in­ dividuals and families often involves resolution. This article will lists some assumptions I make, and strategies I have used to help clients achieve peace in their hearts and in their homes by resolving intraper­ sonal and interpersonal conflict. ASSUMPTIONS: I believe that conflicts occur as in­ dividuals come together in a relationship. I think that because two people have different perspectives, dif­ ferent beliefs, different attitudes, they must resolve dissonance as they try to achieve unity. The word dissonance can be illustrated by picturing a duet in which each is singing in a different key. The two voices do not harmonize but are in competition with one another in dissonance, being out of tune. Conflict is the result when you and I are not in tune, not in agreement, and it occurs as we try to achieve unity and intimacy. Second assumption: the counsel that some give to forget about conflict is, I believe destructive to uni­ ty. I do not believe you can achieve unity by pretending that is not there, or by forgetting about it. -I think, rather, that you need to examine conflict, you need to understand conflict, and it is only through ex­ amination and understanding that you can then remedy conflict.",

      "title": "Character Traits in Explanation",
      "abstract": "i. Suppose you have four colleagues, one of whom is in trouble. The other three each want to help. Of these three would-be helpers, one wants to help out of kindness, one wants to help to gain favour, one wants to help simply out of a general desire to aid the distressed. Since kindness may be considered a trait of character the first of the three, the one who wants to help out of kindness, wants to help due to a trait of character. How, if at all, does motivation based in a trait of character differ from the other two types of motivation in this example, that is from desiring to help to gain favour or from desiring to help simply out of a general desire to aid the distressed? It's odd that a clear answer isn't readily at hand. Traits of character, such as kindness, cruelty, callousness, courage, cowardice, recklessness, impartiality, and tolerance, are indispensable parts of our common sense psychology. Without using concepts of specific character traits we would be unable to continue to talk as we do presently about our colleagues, students, relatives, friends, lovers, and pets. We would also be unable to understand most films, novels, short stories, plays, and biographies. We constantly give common sense explanations of behaviour in terms of character traits. But what exactly are traits of character and how can they serve this explanatory role? First, let me make one point concerning terminology. Many of the character traits I discuss are taken to have moral significance. Indeed, like kindness, cruelty, courage and cowardice, some are considered virtues and some vices. I am interested here in discussing character traits, however, as they might figure in explanations of motivation and behaviour in general. I am not interested in the use of virtues and vices, and hence of some traits of character, in moral justifications. I am also not interested here in considering how virtues and vices, and hence some character traits, contribute to explanations of moral motives or behaviour as such; I am not here interested, for instance, in explanations that ascribe the virtue",

      "title": "Inviting Children to Grieve.",
      "abstract": "Children in the United States today do not have the experiences with death to which children were exposed years ago. Contrasted with the past when death and illness were dealt with in the home by the family, experiences with death are very much removed from contemporary, everyday life. The elderly and terminally ill are sent to live in long-term care facilities or live far away from the family's young people. When death occurs, the body is sent immediately to a funeral home to be taken care of by specialists. These factors, combined with the idea that our society is fearful of death and avoids the subject whenever possible, lead to the conclusion that direct death experiences are no longer a normal part of a child's life (Despelder & Strickland, 1983). In addition, adults try to shield children from the realities of death. Many people think little children won't understand death and will just become confused and upset. They want to protect children and think talking realistically about death with them will cause the children to suffer unnecessary pain or make them grow up too fast. Some people often believe that because children may not have a realistic understanding of the concept of death, they don't grieve or become upset when a death or loss occurs (Wass, 1991). No matter how hard society tries, it is a futile endeavor to hide death from children. Death often occurs in a child's life although he or she does not usually directly experience or witness the dying process. Any child who has the capacity to feel emotions can experience grief-related pain. When people do not talk to children about death, children become confused and distressed. While it is impossible to protect children from the hardships of death-grief, mourning, and bereavement-it is possible for adults to create an inviting environment in which children can express feelings and ask questions about death and loss. Children will benefit from understanding and will then proceed more effectively through the grieving process (Wolfelt, 1983). Definitions and Clarification of Terms To define and distinguish the terms that are related to loss experiences is necessary, as these terms are often confused and misused. Bereavement is the state of being that is caused by a loss (Wolfelt, 1983). When speaking of bereavement, people often assume that it is related to death. However, losses for children pertain to other experiences such as divorce, moving away from home, and a parent's termination from a job (White, 1993). For the purposes of this article, is discussed as loss due to death. Grief is defined as the emotional suffering caused by a death or bereavement (Wolfelt, 1983, 26). Grief can be conceptualized as a process that involves a constellation of different emotions and manners of expression. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross (1969) describes as involving these stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. A bereaved person does not progress through these stages in an orderly fashion; instead, a person may feel all of these at one time, some of these, or none of these things. Grief is an individual experience and is, therefore, experienced in unique ways. Mourning is often described as grief gone public (Wolfelt, 1983, 27). This process refers to the actions people take following the death of a significant person in their lives. Mourning involves societal rites such as funerals and memorial services. Different cultures have many various customs and traditions for mourning. Finally, work constitutes the activities that are involved in working through a loss (Wolfelt, 1983). There are tasks a grieving person must complete in order to continue their lives in a healthy fashion. There are four main tasks in work: * Accepting the reality of the loss * Experiencing the emotions associated with the loss * Adjusting to the environment in which the significant person is no longer there or change has occurred * Withdrawing the energy used dealing with the loss so it can be reinvested in new relationships and life events (Worden, 1991) Just like adults, bereaved children need to conduct their work in an inviting environment that is understanding of this need. …",

      "title": "Critical Vulnerability: An Imperative Approach to Educational Leadership",
      "abstract": "When I dare to be powerful--to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. --Audre Lorde, (n.d.) I have come to believe over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood. --Audre Lorde, 1984, p.40 Proper to right thinking is a willingness to risk, to welcome the new, which simply cannot be rejected simply because it is new no more than the old can be rejected because chronologically it is no longer new. --Paulo Freire, 1998, p. 41 [I am] not afraid to condemn the exploitation of labor and the manipulation that makes a rumor into truth and truth into a mere rumor. To condemn the fabrication of illusions, in which the unprepared become hopelessly trapped and the weak and the defenseless are destroyed. To condemn making promises when one has no intention of keeping one's word, which causes lying to become an almost necessary way of life. To condemn the calumny of character assassination simply for the joy of it and the fragmentation of the utopia of human solidarity. --Paulo Freire, 1998, p. 23 Introduction When the concept of vulnerability is discussed, often images of harm, threat and potential abuse are evoked. These images are not without substantiation, as one may be able to readily provide examples of past experiences in which individuals were placed at risk of physical, psychological or spiritual injury. For example, in Looking White People in the Eye, Razack (1998) examines the ways in which minoritized bodies were made vulnerable through colonial practices of brutality and exploitation. Smith (1999) also discusses the vulnerability of indigenous communities at the hands of Western researchers seeking to commodify Aboriginal knowledges and life practices. In each of the former contexts, thinking of vulnerability as a negatively imposed term is aptly appropriate as it describes the ways in which individuals were placed in danger and made susceptible to imperialist forces. While this perspective of vulnerability is most relevant and advantageous to the discourse of imperial domination, it does not speak to the discursive practices of resistance that opposed these acts of violence. More importantly, vulnerability as the consequence of subjugation fails to provide a telling account of individuals who willingly and consciously choose to place themselves at risk in order to counter, diffuse and transform these detrimental conditions. In this regard, I speak of individuals like Nelson Mandela and Steven Biko who willingly endured imprisonment and torture in order to expose the genocide of apartheid. I also speak of the legacy of Kwami Nkrumah who despite substantial legal fines, unremittingly published The Accra Evening News in an effort to subvert the imperial myth of African inferiority and motivate Ghanaians to continue their pursuit towards liberation. In naming, I would be remiss to forget individuals like Edward and Irvin Carvery who in conjunction with members of the Africville (1) Genealogical Society, publicly protested the demolition of the Africville community, the forced relocation of its citizens and the municipal expropriation of land by the former city of Halifax. The Carvery brothers' decision to speak out against the Africville atrocity placed them continually at risk of reprisals and often in violation of civic ordinances and statutes. Quite similarly, it is integral to recall the gentle efforts of Viola Desmond, (2) Hazel Roett, (3) and Calvin Woodrow Ruck (4) who courageously assumed vulnerable positions in order to contest domination and further the materialization of critical democracy (5) within their own communities. I sincerely question whether a passive connotation of vulnerability describes their passionate commitment and dedication to social change as this passive assertion fails to reflect the purposeful and strategic engagement that was demonstrated by each of these individuals. …",

      "title": "‘It Makes Me Feel Old’: Understanding the Experience of Recovery From Ankle Fracture at 6 Months in People Aged 50 Years and Over",
      "abstract": "Ankle fracture is a common injury, and depending on injury severity, treatment may be a support boot, cast or surgery. Older people, particularly those with severe injuries who are asked to restrict weight bearing, struggle with early recovery. To elicit older peoples’ experience of recovery 6 months after injury, we drew on a phenomenological approach using interviews. Findings revealed that getting on with life was a way of accepting what it feels like to ‘be vulnerable’, needing to ‘be safe’ while determinedly working hard to ‘be myself’. Being vulnerable identified endurance of inactivity, loneliness and dependency in the non-weight bearing period of recovery, followed by a struggle to weight bear while lacking confidence and being fearful of falling and causing further damage. Being safe conveyed fragility where sensations, pain and stiffness acted as bodily reminders of injury. Lack of function and awareness of danger led to carefulness where planning or curtailing of activities ensured their safety. Being myself showed a determination to push away from a disrupted self-identify of being older or disabled while being challenged by the continuous process of learning to be more mobile. A lack of readiness for old age created a drive to age well. Despite loss of ability, participants hoped to regain their pre-injury way of living. This study challenges practice that disregards the hard work required to recover from ankle fracture. As comorbidity increases with age, failure to consider this aspect may contribute to frailty in this group of older people.",

      "abstract": "A DREAM-LIKE INTRODUCTIONMost of them arrived well before it began, a few did so just in the nick of time, and one or two even after it had started. They had seen the publicity through professional networks and ostensibly wanted to learn from direct experience. The promise was a level playing field- there would be no lectures or theories to feel inadequate about, participants would all be the same, equally open to one another. The prospect of five long days to come together seemed very exciting and also frightening. Some had been warned by well-intentioned acquaintances that these events foster violent and dangerous situations, that people go mad (with anger and desire), relationships are made, broken, and reshaped, but also that it would be an enlightening experience-and that, once over, being with others (at work, in friendships, relationships, family) would never be the same.A small group had been selected through a secret process by the leader and his close associates to play a particular role as experienced performers. They had arrived a day earlier to introduce themselves to each other, expose their vulnerabilities, and tell of their dreams and apprehensions. They had carefully planned their deployment, ending their long discussions with a communal dinner that made them feel readier to come into contact with the participants the following day. They had agreed to dress in a considered style of restrained celebration-most (but not all) of the men in formal attire, while the women would wear elegant outfits and some casual garments but no jeans. The women would appear more different from each other than the men did, even if one man might wear an extraordinarily colourful or amazingly crumpled shirt.It was now close to the starting time, and the participants had been directed on arrival to gather in the largest room, where they were surprised to find almost a hundred chairs in row after row in straight lines, facing another row of chairs at the front. They began to take their places, mostly in the middle and back of the room, though some sat singly and daringly on their own, confronting the eerily empty row facing all the others. Some had a vacant expression, some appeared to read the boring handbooks they had been given, and others watched with apparent interest the entrance of those who might be known from different contexts.And now the performers started coming in, in ones or twos. They seemed to know their allocated seat in the row facing all the others, and took their place without hesitation. A grave-looking person for whom a seat had been left unoccupied in the centre came in just before the very last performer, who walked in exactly as the wall showed the starting time, closed the door, and took the last seat in that front row.The room seemed now complete (even if a few chairs were still empty). The person in the centre of the front row stood up, introduced himself as the director, welcomed the participants, invited those seated at either side of him to introduce themselves as staff, and proceeded to read from a script explaining-in terms that did not make immediate sense-the intention and the process of what would follow each day, asking those in the facing row who seemed in charge of a particular aspect of the whole event, to say a few words about their respective areas of responsibility.They did so, standing up to speak. This appeared orchestrated since they all seemed to do it in the same way, waiting to be called, with a similar deference to authority. At some point, the one who had come in last spoke about administrative and practical arrangements. Beyond the security announcements there seemed to be quite a few instructions-what should happen if one wanted to communicate something to the staff, the way to communicate to the rest of the participants, and a quaint preoccupation with time in respect of absences, lateness, and the precise location of a master clock from which all the many activities would be accurately timed through the five days. …",

      "abstract": "We all have a story; doesn’t it make a difference when we know them? As I get older and as I see my own children grow, I’ve noticed the fast pace we are living. Society has a self-destructive addiction to faster living and the world will tell you to always move forward and there are no limits to how far you can get. Don’t pause, don’t reflect. Over-scheduling and double booking as you juggle ten plates in your busy week. We are seeing an alarming increase in stress-related disorders at all ages, beginning with elementary school-aged children who are struggling with obesity, depression, anxiety, attention disorders, and all kinds of learning disabilities, and a list of problems for all ages (Brown, 2015). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an increase in the number of socially isolated people and an increase in loneliness, fear, and other mental health factors (Murayama et al., 2021). World pandemics, the pace of society, and increased academic expectations have had an impact on our schools, and on the relationships students create when they have the opportunity to get to know one another. Our stories, when shared, make a difference to everyone who listens to them. These stories provide a space for us to build a relationship. In our fast-paced, performance-driven, ever-changing schools, we lose the time and importance of sharing our stories. The loss of time we spend with each other face to face has impacted our empathy with each other (Konrath et al., 2011). Is it possible to implement narrative storytelling that provides a place where students can share their stories to ensure that more relationships and empathy among a class would grow as a result? When we create an intentional space in our schools, will barriers be broken between students and teachers? In this study, relational data from teachers and an administrator who implemented a narrative storytelling curriculum, the Front Porch Initiative, in their school building were gathered using a survey design and analyzed. The findings from the study suggest students need a gathering place to reconnect with those around us and to re-establish a space for conversation, commonality, and community.",

Readers are challenged to accept death as well as life, and that happiness in the later years is embodied in one's capacity to embrace health or sickness as a powerful lesson.

From the author's own experiences, living over eight decades, ritual has always been accepted as a rite of passage that marks a person's transition from one status to another, including birth, coming-of-age, marriage, and death. The hunger, either conscious or unconscious, for an experience of closure at the time of separation becomes so great that group members often create some form of ritual. These may be helpful toward the group goals, or simply ease the anxiety of separation. It is possible that in the outpouring of emotion that takes place in the farewell ceremony, any unresolved issues might burst forth, leading to very painful or destructive situations. Although some practitioners feel that there is a particular value in the ritual being developed by the group itself, the author believes that these are more likely to fall short of the desired goals.",

Generativity springs from love, both literally and figuratively. Under the banner of love, young adults care for each other, which prepares them to care for the next generation. Yet, the author would argue that the full expression of generativity, including features fraught with ambivalence and psychological complexity, typically awaits the midlife years. Generativity springs from necessity, too, in the hard work of caring, in paid and unpaid work itself, in volunteer activities, through leadership, and in a host of other activities, opportunities, and burdens. And generativity sometimes simply happens, by accident, chance events, bad luck or good, and in situations that defy the best efforts of human agency. Accepting the limits of human agency, and the inevitable constraints on generativity, becomes an increasingly urgent task as adults move into their later years.",

      "abstract": "It seems it would be helpful for all impasses to be “recollected in tranquility.” In the thick of impasses, however, when we are experiencing pressure, defensiveness, vulnerability, and the responsibility to come up with a quick solution, it can be nearly impossible to think clearly. Time may take us to a place of greater calm and fresh awareness. But it may also provide an illusory calm, leaving us stuck circling in old familiar grooves, grooves rimmed by our own unconscious vulnerabilities and limitations. At such times, we may operate in a perceived state of calm, but with a set of powerful, yet ineffective, unseen or outgrown, concretized beliefs and perceptions, creating a perception of calmness. Some of these may even silence or damage the cooperative or struggling patient, who remains or dares to return (out of a longing to connect or make things “right”). I wondered whether what Dr. Pizer's patient said at the end of Rebecca's second therapy with him was true (that she no longer needed a hug from him, finding it more mature to proceed without one), or if this was merely what she felt she should say in order to leave a key relationship she valued—also in peace and tranquillity.",

      "abstract": "Extract This series is built on a simple presupposition: that it helps to have a book recommended and discussed by someone who cares for it. Books are not purely self-sufficient: they need people and they need to get to what is personal within them. The people we have been seeking as contributors to My Reading are readers who are also writers: novelists and poets; literary critics, outside as well as inside universities, but also thinkers from other disciplines—philosophy, psychology, science, theology, and sociology—beside the literary; and, not least of all, intense readers whose first profession is not writing itself but, for example, medicine, or law, or a non-verbal form of art. Of all of them we have asked: What books or authors feel as though they are deeply yours, influencing or challenging your life and work, most deserving of rescue and attention, or demanding of feeling and use? What is it like to love this book? What is it like to have a thought or idea or doubt or memory, not cold and in abstract, but live in the very act of reading? What is it like to feel, long after, that this writer is a vital part of your life? We ask our authors to respond to such bold questions by writing not conventionally but personally—whatever “personal” might mean, whatever form or style it might take, for them as individuals. This does not mean overt confession at the expense of a chosen book or author; but nor should our writers be afraid of making autobiographical connections. What was wanted was whatever made for their own hardest thinking in careful relation to quoted sources and specifics. The work was to go on in the taut and resonant space between these readers and their chosen books. And the interest within that area begins precisely when it is no longer clear how much is coming from the text and how much is coming from its readers—where that distinction is no longer easily tenable because neither is sacrificed to the other. That would show what reading meant at its most serious and how it might have relation to an individual life.",

      "abstract": "Voluntary decision to take one’s life is termed suicide. The issue of suicide has generated heated and controvertible argument as some were inclined to recommend suicide on certain grounds while others spoke vehemently against suicide. It is from the foregoing that this paper seeks to underscore some arguments for and against suicide taking into cognizance the moral posture regarding the subject matter (suicide). Does man's free moral agency license him to do anything even to include willful taking of his life? Is there any gain living when all hope is gone, or in the face of suffering a terminal and incurable disease? Sometimes ones loses the essence of life and comes face to face with suicide as a better and only option what is the socio-economic, political, legal and moral stand on suicide? These and more are the concern of this paper..",

      "title": "Dilemmas of Trust",
      "abstract": "Every human relationship, whether between lovers, friends, family members, or colleagues, involves trust or distrust. When we trust, we take for granted that others are not out to harm us; we relax and feel safe. When we distrust, we are fearful; we withdraw and try to protect ourselves. In Dilemmas of Trust, Trudy Govier explores the profound effect trust and distrust have, not only on our relationships but on our outlook on the world and our sense of self. Trust facilitates communication, love, friendship, and co-operation and is fundamentally important to human relationships and personal development. Using examples from daily life, interviews, literature, and film, Govier describes the role of trust in friendship and in family relationships as well as the connection between self-trust, self-respect, and self-esteem. She examines the reasons we trust or distrust others and ourselves, and the expectations and vulnerabilities that accompany those attitudes. But trust should not be blind. Acknowledging that distrust is often warranted, Govier describes strategies for coping with distrust and designing workable relationships despite it. She also examines situations in which the integrity of interpersonal relationships has been violated by serious breaches of trust and explores themes of forgiveness, reconciliation, and the restoration of trust. By encouraging reflection on our own attitudes of trust and distrust, this fascinating book points the way to a better understanding of our relationships and ourselves. Trudy Govier is an independent philosopher who lives and works in Calgary, Alberta. Her other books include Social Trust and Human Communities (McGill-Queen's), God, the Devil, and the Perfect Pizza, and A Practical Study of Argument.",

But it can also be a source of unease, of fruitless longing and regret. We may be harmed by love, harmed by loving and perhaps even harmed by the love of another. Love does us no good when we love the wrong person. If such love is reciprocated (and perhaps especially if it is reciprocated) it can lead us to waste the best years of our lives. It may lead us to lose our chance of contentment without in any way adding to the well-being of the person that we love. Similarly, we may love someone who could make us happy if they were to love us in return but they do not do so. Our love may be unreciprocated and yet it may stubbornly refuse to go away. Under such circumstances, love can be little more than a subtle form of self-laceration. These considerations may lead us to accept that love does not conquer all.",

      "title": "Anger Related to Pre-Conception, Conception, and the Pre- and Perinatal Period",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Searching for the possible roots of anger, the author, from extensive experiential, clinical work with clients looks at the pre-conception imprinting that colours not only the birth, but also the life scripts and personality of humans, in order to find healing from violent, angry, raging negative imprinting. KEY WORDS: Anger, aggression, violence, preconception, conception, imprinting, birth trauma, pre and perinatal psychotherapy. INTRODUCTION What is Anger? Anger is an honest, normal feeling. We all experience anger - it can be healthy, creative, and freeing or unhealthy, silent, destructive and binding. It can be positive or negative anger within our personality. It is what we actually do with these feelings, whether we can accept them, and deal with them, that causes all the trouble. Repressed Emotions To speak specifically about anger as an isolated emotion is difficult. In regression work one emotion rarely stands alone. Four pure primal feelings have been identified: longing the craving for the fulfilment of unmet needs such as love; terror, the extreme fear or dread of not being fulfilled; ,/ay, the intense feelings of happiness and pleasure; and rage, the overwhelming angry passion directed at those who have not fulfilled the child's needs. It is important to be aware of, and clarify, these feelings during regression work in order to specifically place the emotion of anger in its rightful place. The following diagram (after Broder, 1976) may help to clarify this: Our Research in the Last Decade on Anger We have found in our work, based on the hypotheses of Dr. Frank Lake, that anger may be stimulated by fear or terror, resentment or bitterness and lead into panic, grief, shame, and desperation. We live in a violent age, where rape, murder, joy riding and road rage are everyday events. Lake was a man ahead of his time. He made connections between the negative umbilical input of the first trimester and recognised that the anger and rage experienced here may push a person violently into ripping out trees, slashing tires, football violence, revenge killings, and other murderous atrocities. Throughout the last decades many researchers, Lake (1981), Lloyd de Mause (1996), Leboyer (1975), Verny and Kelly (1981), and Chamberlain (1995, 1998) to name but a few, and we also, in our work at Amethyst, have found that the out-of-control anger and violence being perpetrated on a personal and global level today may be an off loading of the violence experienced in traumatic births and violent and abusive pregnancies. Whatever we may think of this, people's anger has deep roots and a current conflict is usually a trigger for a reservoir of buried emotion to surface. Working in regressive states, whether it be Primal Integration and Regression Therapy, Holotropic Breathwork or Pre and Perinatal Psychotherapy, can offer new light, new insights and new hope on the nature of aggression, anger and violence. Grof (1998) states that according to these insights, aggression is not something that reflects our true nature but rather a screen that separates us from it. Hopefully through deep experiential work reaching pre and perinatal and transpersonal levels, anger, in whatever form, can be safely expressed, worked through and transformed. Pre Conception In our most recent research we have been led to believe that very early parenting begins before conception. If our discoveries and experiences in Pre and Perinatal Psychotherapy are to be taken seriously, then the state of the parents to be is of immense importance to the well being of the new individual to be conceived. If we are affected in infancy, childhood, and adulthood by the positive and negative situations in our life - then it appears from regression work that the sexual act between our parents, in whatever emotions or non-emotions we were conceived, will affect our coming into being. …",

We all interpret levels of relationships in different ways, so I do not want to spend time discussing 'types of relationship'. My own feeling is that there comes a time when 'something' happens, and instinctively you know that you have a basis on which you can build. For some, this 'time' may take months to present itself — for others, it happens very quickly. The danger is to lose heart if the process is not happening as fast as you may want it to. When this happens, you still 'go through the motions' but not with the same interest and enthusiasm, and this is quickly picked up by the handicapped person and can have very negative repercussions. Allowances must be made for off-days by both parties. There is no specific time limit set on objectives like these being reached. If it is taking longer than anticipated, go along with it — it will happen sooner or later.",

      "abstract": "Intimidation is a serious, insidious and coercive behaviour used by individual/s on others to force them to do something against their will. This behaviour affects victims, members of their family, their friends and the wider community in a variety of negative ways. We all have some idea of intimidation even without any direct personal experience. But we need to understand exactly what intimidation is, who intimidates, where it occurs, how it evolves and when a person is likely to be a victim if we are to tackle this issue in any significant way. One way of understanding what intimidation is and the various effects intimidation has on a person, is to break the word down into its component parts i.e. to intimidate is to browbeat, bulldoze, cow, bully and bludgeon. These words all mean to frighten into submission, compliance, or agreement but each act has its own particular affect on an individual: To intimidate implies the presence of a fear-inducing force or threat of force on a person, family or property. â?¢\tBrowbeat suggests the persistent use of highhanded, disdainful, or domineering tactics. â?¢\tBulldoze is to remove all spirit of opposition and develop feelings of complete helplessness and isolation. â?¢\tTo Cow a person is to instil an abject state of timidity, demoralisation and of living in fear as a result of physical/mental abuse, threat or harassment. â?¢\tBullies intimidate through loud, overbearing, undermining insidious or threatening behaviours. â?¢\tBludgeon is the use of violent and forceful methods to insure compliance of another person against their will (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/intimidation)",

      "title": "Beyond \"Simply Understanding\": Sociologically Reimagining and Reconstructing the Meaning of My Education",
      "abstract": "In the beginning of life, when we are infants, we need others survive, right? And at the end of life, when you get like me, you need others survive, right? But here's the secret: in between, we need others as well. --Morrie Schwartz, quoted in Albom (1997:157) The word has a lot of connotations, most of them negative. The Oxford Dictionary defines spoil as both to harm the character of (a child) by being too lenient and to treat with great or kindness, consideration, or And most times, at least in our society, it is followed by the word brat. It strikes me as rather humorous that our society can believe someone be treated with excessive kindness, consideration, or But of course, a society that stresses hard work, consumerism and wealth cannot really value kindness, consideration or generosity. It is due this dichotomy that I sometimes wonder if I am or just very lucky have lived the life I have lived. My life has by no means been perfect, but I seem have a way of bouncing back from the bad things that have happened in my life and make things turn out in a way. In our society, where people tend have a very linear and individualistic way of thinking, I should have graduated college years ago, be married or about get married, live on my own, or with my boyfriend, and have a full-time career. But none of that is happening! And I sense that people often feel the need bring that up me. Usually it's people I haven't seen for a while, like distant family or old friends from high school. The reality is that I live at home with my mom and my brother, work part time while taking a full course load at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Boston and am surrounded by people who love and care for me, without many of whom I don't think I could survive. But I can't help feeling that a lot of people look at me like I am just doing what I am doing because I don't want deal with the real world--like a spoiled brat who doesn't want grow up. When I began writing this paper, I focused on my packrat but now I see it as not only a problem, but also another insight into why I am the way I am. I am the biggest packrat I have ever known. I don't mean I keep things for a little while and then eventually throw them away, or keep really meaningful things in a few shoe-boxes memorialize the good old days. I mean that I am 99% sure that somewhere in storage I still have the wrapper from the gum I was chewing the first time I kissed a boy--in 1994. And that is probably wedged between an old bank statement and a pair of socks. Part of the reason I have so much stuff is that I have moved from my childhood home and back again a couple times. So many of the stuff that I have are just leftovers from my childhood that I haven't gotten the chance go through yet. This may not appear that big of a at first glance, but as I prepare graduate, move onto graduate school and enter the real world this looms in the back of my mind as I think about how much stuff I have, and that this stuff may represent the very core of my subconscious rejection of growing up and moving into the next phase of my life. I have also realized, while planning write this paper, that this seemingly funny problem has connections another habit in my life: failing prepare for the future. Both of these habits seem be related holding onto the past or some sort of nostalgic attempt keep things the way they used be. Using the sociological imagination as a guide, in what follows I hope analyze the interrelation of these in the framework of a focus on my educational/career goals and plans. I graduated from high school in 1999. At that time I planned go the University of Connecticut (UConn) for four years, graduate, get a job, get married and have kids by the time I was 30. …",

At the same time taboo words are often demanded if is to be one of the boys at a party, or on an assembly line, or a comedian at night clubs.

      "title": "Leadership matters",
      "abstract": "FigureGrit and resilience—these two words are currently used to describe nurses and nurse leaders in the face of chaos, strife, extreme uncertainty, and human suffering. We meet these challenges with our emotional and spiritual bravery. The usual ways we combat emotional stress and strain are limited because of the immediate need to focus on the severity and quantity of patients. Leading in a healthcare organization is demanding under normal circumstances, and what normally works may not be the best way to lead during this time of crisis. Beyond the clamor and cacophony of events, leadership matters. When we're able to disconnect from work, we can recharge our emotional batteries. Finding meaning in our work by experiencing our passion and purpose is one way to generate positive energy to tackle obstacles. However, living in a surge environment means that there's little time to disconnect and reflect on our work. What we do have is each other. Nurses have always understood that our work families are just as important as our personal families. Nurturing our interpersonal connections with others at work keeps us going. No one really knows what you're going through except the person right beside you. This gives nurses a special bond and a connection that can help us adjust and move on. Leaders support nurses and other healthcare team members to nurture these vital connections. Leaders who are honest and caring connect with nurses and teams in a much different way than just presenting the usual leadership vision. Vision is a critical leadership skill, but it isn't enough, especially now. In “The Psychology Behind Effective Crisis Leadership,” Gianpiero Petriglieri notes that in times of crisis and radical change, vision has limitations. Nurses are already motivated to care for patients to get the best outcomes possible, so instead of vision, Petriglieri suggests that we need “holding”—soothing distress (containing) and interpreting what's happening to help others make sense of a confusing time. Assuring job security and fairness, letting people participate in decisions, and encouraging adaptation to challenges are all behaviors of holding. As Editor-in-Chief Rosanne Raso noted in her podcast, “Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Discussion with Editor-in-Chief Rosanne Raso,” being visible and communicating are essential, as are truth telling, providing hope, and thanking our team members. Celebrating successes from each extubation to each discharge is important to lift spirits and hold connections. Another vital leadership action is ensuring staff safety and well-being—both are priorities. By definition, grit is passion and a sustained persistence that encompasses resilience and self-control. Leaders display grit when faced with extreme emotional, spiritual, and moral distress. Leadership matters when we “hold” the team and when we're caring yet confident; strong yet calm; and open, honest, and vulnerable. Thank you for your gritty leadership during this pandemic. You matter.Figure",

      "abstract": "The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 38 mothers and fathers who had lost an infant. The focus of the interview was aggression and guilt during mourning work. The participants felt strong shame after separation. Phenomena such as strong irrational guilt, aggression, and hesitation toward others were similar to feelings typical of the paranoid-schizoid position. However, mourners did not lose their sense of reality, continued to do daily chores, and kept taking care of others. In this period, mourners were in disintegration, similar to individuals in the paranoid-schizoid position. Shame may be the feeling in the residue of the paranoid-schizoid position, through which they felt persecuted by others, their partner, relatives, and God. Their aggression was strong, but generally their aggression and impulses came to be used constructively and they progressed to integration. At the moment their children died, mourners fluctuated between disintegration and integration. After a certain interval, fluctuation subsided or integration predominated. In times of fluctuation, containers were very important for mourners to move toward integration. Participants reported changes in their lifestyle after the loss of a child. Mental health professionals should view aggressive impulses among such people during mourning not as an obstacle, but rather as a means to move toward integration. The authors speculate that a psychotherapist can serve as a container for mourners.",

The fact that Tolstoi himself was a living contradiction of the separateness of experiences and ideas is a sufficient reason for not attempting to isolate any one of them from all the rest. But, whether because his understanding of himself fell short of that of other human beings or because he was forced by the very power of his understanding to turn about and attend to his other task—that of understanding how to live with himself and with his fellow men—Tolstoi chose to divide his life into independent periods. The fourth and last one, in which, he said, he “hoped to die,” enlarged (or, as some would have it, narrowed) his understanding until it became prophecy, or religion, or a huge moral ax which he leveled against himself and the surrounding world.",

      "abstract": "Like a sickness, paranoia can destroy goodwill and relation­ships in schools. It takes so little, at times, to ferment suspi­cion of intentional ill will. Once we begin to suspect something is amiss, we look for confirmation. We look for evidence that someone is doing harm to our reputation or sabotaging our relationships. We experi­ence one betrayal or infraction, and we can’t let go of viewing someone through that lens. Surprisingly, when we look so hard for evidence of harm, we can usually find it, even when it does not exist. • Certain members of your teaching team begin gathering for happy hour, but not all are invited. You begin suspecting that they plan to propose sweeping changes to the department. • Your tenure is pending. When a teacher who serves on the tenure committee sighs, “It’s been a rough day” as he leaves the meeting, you begin worrying that trouble is lurking for your future at the school. • You notice a teacher and a student standing alone in the hall­way, and as you approach, they both stop talking and look embarrassed and uncomfortable. You wonder if their suspi­cious behavior hints at an unethical relationship. At times of high- stakes turmoil, paranoia can become pandemic in schools. It is up to individuals to guard against it. What do we do when paranoia lurks? • Use “second thoughts” to disprove your opinion. • Dismantle the thinking that can blind you to innocent or less sensational interpretations. • Calmly and confidently ask the person you have concerns about if there is a problem, or if you are misinterpreting some behaviors or actions. • Strengthen yourself by knowing that you can make amends for any misunderstandings. • Reconnect with your honor and good intentions. Renewed affirmations of vitality are the benefits of these actions. We feel our powerful spirit return to us, and our aliveness signals our revived personal strength.",

Suppose further that the vice had to be either cowardice or impatience. Which would you choose? I believe almost everyone would choose impatience without hesitation. There are sound moral as well as purely self-regarding reasons for despising cowardice, and to that extent our preference would be reasonable. If we say that a man who is a coward is also compassionate, we know that his compassion cannot be relied upon in any circumstances where it must contend with fear, and if he has a sense of justice, that will be useless if oppression has to be resisted. We cannot even expect him to pursue his own good whenever he perceives that to be hazardous, and so even the self-regarding virtues are corrupted by his dominating vice. On the other hand, a pronounced impatience may seem to be compossible with abundant virtue. Those who are just but cannot patiently endure tyranny are perhaps the most formidable threat to tyranny, and people who boldly go out to seize their own good often fare rather better than those who patiently await its arrival.",

I sometimes think that I, myself, am the cause of this excessive load of patients. It may be my need to be needed which probably creates or encourages this dependency. For a long time I have had the feeling that I work harder than my colleagues. I then calm myself down by saying that I offer more comfort, more understanding, to the people I serve, which explains why they search me out more than the others. This, I guess, is a thing to be proud of, and not to be blamed for. But when I am overworked I curse myself and come down excessively hard on myself! Yesterday I had an insight that there is another aspect of one's personality that may encourage visits: voyeurism. Being in such intimacy with the persons one treats, one has the opportunity to witness a whole spectrum of family dramas: marital disharmony, unemployment, disease, disability, and personal defeats or successes. Sometimes I feel that I do not need to watch soap operas on TV, since the dramas unfold right in front of me in nearly every patient that comes to see me, even for the more trivial complaints such as backache or urinary tract infection.",

      "title": "Difficult Doctors and Rational Fears",
      "abstract": "Difficult Doctors and Rational Fears Nancy Berlinger (bio) Should the doing of bioethics require the reading of novels? No, unless we believe that fiction trumps nonfiction as a means of exploring complex issues in medicine and the life sciences, and also that writers of novels have a lock on the arts-and-humanities department of the moral imagination. And it’s hard to get science right—convincing, not distracting—in a literary novel, even as plot-driven genre fiction may rely on biotechnological twists. So, let’s narrow our scope to the care of the sick, and to medical ethics. Should the development of our personal capacity for empathy with those who suffer—with those who are sick, dying, frightened, threatened, weary, or in need of care and compassion for some other reason—include the reading of novels (and other fiction) in addition to reading nonfiction, discussing difficult cases, or writing personal narratives about our own experiences? If so, does it matter which novels? Yes, and yes, if only to make sure The Death of Ivan Ilyich makes it onto the syllabus. Tolstoy’s novella about a judge who is blindsided by mortality—we just redecorated, how can I be dying?—meets Martha Nussbaum’s test for the sort of reading experience that is most likely to stir the emotions and in so doing, encourage the reader “to imagine what it is like to live the life of another person who might, given changes in circumstance, be oneself or one of one’s loved ones.”1 While reading nonfiction can engage the emotions, it may prompt sympathy rather than empathy: the factual details may remind us that this is not our story, however much [End Page 25] we are moved by it. Discussing and writing about our own experiences can deepen our understanding of what we have experienced, but may not suffice to help us imagine a different experience, a different future, or a different self. Realist novels—and, as long as we’re making moral judgments, let’s make aesthetic judgments, too, and clarify that Nussbaum is talking about classic novels—aid the moral imagination because they invite us into a complete world, force us to “see and to respond to things that may be difficult to confront,” and also allow us to experience not just admiration, but pleasure. The reader of The Death of Ivan Ilyich is allowed to enjoy the experience of reading Tolstoy while simultaneously having her emotions wrung out by the experience of empathizing with Tolstoy’s dying protagonist. Even if this reader enjoys the experience of reading an outstandingly well-crafted personal essay or other nonfiction narrative about the experience of life-threatening illness—think of Marjorie Williams’s “Hit by Lightning” or Anne Fadiman’s The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down—admitting to aesthetic pleasure when confronted by the documented pain of real others seems callous. Their pain is not there for our pleasure. The special virtue of Ivan Ilyich is that it’s short. This matters if we are exhorting physicians and nurses to read fiction as a means of reflecting on the work they do, and that we may not do ourselves. But this essay is not about Ivan Ilyich. This essay is about a classic novel about a good doctor. It’s a long novel—perhaps too long for the medical ethics syllabus, but worth seeking out by readers interested in what the origins of contemporary medical practice looked like to a Victorian novelist writing about his contemporary scene. When medicine was organizing itself as a profession, how did physicians make choices about which members of society got to see a real doctor? What did patients expect from real doctors? Did nineteenth-century physicians have conflicting ideas about how, and how much, they ought to be paid? (Yes.) Is boutique medicine a new idea? (No.) Anthony Trollope’s Doctor Thorne is not a portrait of an ideal Victorian-era physician. Dr. Thomas Thorne is gruff, prickly, idiosyncratic. He is also an adoptive parent of exceptional virtue, a good citizen, someone who is trusted even by those who don’t like him much. Trollope calls him “my hero” (p...",

And, as this goes with that, not terribly good at having dreams and fantasies, because of restricted imagination; often stuck with concrete, realistic, logical thinking, because of a sort of group-wide learned inability to invoke emotional responses to problems. Behind what I’m going to say is one central theme, a couple pleas and a question of sorts. The theme is: why do we do what we do, in this profession? Shouldn’t we seriously pause to think about it? Hard work, competitiveness, pushing yourself harder, success: these things are unusually venerated in our profession, and in much of our world generally.

Stress is undoubtedly more pervasive and acute for today's Market Beings than it was for people in precapitalist times. The kinds of stress that we share with them--due to natural disasters, poverty, bereavement--are much less easily dissipated through ritual, religious or other forms of public expression, and the individual is also less protected by community, family, kinship or neighbourhood group. In other words, the stressful life-events might be similar--and even attenuated--but the individual is more exposed to them.",

      "title": "A memorable patient: Happiness is...",
      "abstract": "It has been observed in these pages that having a parent's health problem referred to a geriatrician is nature's way of telling you to grow up. The call to the psychogeriatrician is often the signal that a cherished relationship has undergone an irrevocable change and that a new order has taken its place as the prelude to an unwelcome full independence.\r\n\r\nAnd so one day the time came to admit that my father's forgetfulness, irrational behaviour, and wandering were no longer just subjects for resigned family humour but were becoming a hazard to him and a nuisance to the local community. Thus, he and I came to sit in the psychogeriatrician's office—all very friendly, with me probably more nervous than anybody. The initial orientation challenges established the severity of Dad's problems—a receptive and expressive dysphasia behind which it was difficult to imagine a functioning intellect. There was a pause (was there any point continuing?), and then a little “comprehension” exercise: “What is happiness?”\r\n\r\nWas this fair on a man in such a condition? I sometimes wonder if it wasn't just a gambit in the hope of passing a few minutes that loomed empty, since it's a question that I suspect would have many of us scrabbling for a useful response.\r\n\r\nAnd what have other, working minds contributed? My Concise Oxford Dictionary has “happiness” merely as the noun associated with the word “happy,” whose own entry seems to consist of synonyms: “lucky, fortunate, contented with one's lot.” Those who work with words have fitted the concept with diverse associations. Here are a few examples: something the pursuit of which is “an inalienable right of man” (Thomas Jefferson, American Declaration of Independence); that which when recalled leads to the greatest misery (Dante); the result of an annual income of twenty pounds with expenditure of nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence (Charles Dickens, Pickwick Papers); or simply the effect of “a good bank balance, a good cook, and a good appetite” (Thoreau).\r\n\r\nPerhaps a waste of time, then, asking an old man who can't tell you what day of the week it is. But an answer came. “Happiness is a thing, like this,” a wave of the hands. “You lose some and then you get some back.” And that was that. The rest of the consultation was brief, and the offer of care at a day centre no surprise and, sadly, little help.\r\n\r\nBut my father's answer has stayed with me. Was it actually worth anything? Was it just random gibberish from an ischaemic temporoparietal zone? Or a final haiku from an old man withdrawing from the world, illustrated not with a calligrapher's flourish but with a hand jive? Whatever, he lived another nine months, and it stands as the last (possibly) sensible thing he said. I have always found it useful as a piece of philosophical advice, and I thought I'd share it with you.",

The process of giving up an established home and friends and relocating to another neighborhood, city, or geographical region is often accompanied by fatigue, feelings of loss and alienation, and fear of the unknown. Moving for adults may be made more pleasant by the anticipation of a more challenging or rewarding occupation, or by the intellectual stimulation of relocating to a new environment. Unfortunately, most moves are not made to improve one's life. Many moves are dictated by other life events such as deaths and divorces, and come as an added burden to those experiencing life's catastrophes. Nevertheless, for many individuals, moving is a normal part of adult life, as with the civilian and military employees of the Department of Defense who routinely relocate every 2 to 5 years. Although there is a connection between adult attitudes and children's reactions, we cannot assume children will experience a move the same way parents do.",

      "abstract": "In Vulnerability and Resilience, vulnerability is not the final word. Rather, resilience provides the cutting edge and living breath in the stories of subjects who are vulnerable. And they have many stories: stories of being trapped in bodies, teachings, and/or situations that make them (and others like them) vulnerable to discrimination, hatred, and rejection; stories of being trapped because of their bodies, theologies, and/or cultures; and stories of being trapped for no-good reason. For subjects who are vulnerable, life is like a maze of traps, and stories of resilience keep them going. The contributors to Vulnerability and Resilience refuse to be trapped. At the intersection of body and liberation theologies, they tell their stories in the hope that they will expose cultures that make individuals and communities vulnerable, and that those stories will encourage vulnerable subjects to be resilient and bring change to theological institutions that conserve vulnerability. Because of the location of the contributors—the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, Caribbean, and Oceania—this book is a testimony that vulnerability is present all over the world, and that resilience is a liberating alternative.",

      "title": "You’ve Got an Attitude!",
      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "THE SENSE OF HONESTY",
      "abstract": "One of the most difficult lessons we, as adults, must learn is to recapture the sense of honesty which was so keen and powerful in childhood.Growing up, maturing, reaching adulthood, often means disguising our real feelings and thoughts, our real selves, in order to win approval, recognition, and status.But the young child, who is not even aware that truth is a virtue, has such a keen sense of speaking directly, truthfully, openly, that even when his parents teach him to be kind, tactful, and polite his sense of honesty, his intimacy with his own senses and primary experiences is so genuine and pervasive that he will persist in saying what he feels, in being honest with what he perceives, no matter how strongly he may differ with others or how great the consequences may be.Only after repeated correction, disapproval, and punishment does he begin to learn the gains of distortion, subtlety, and deviation.Only then does the social need for kindness and sympathy, for achievement and reward, exceed the determination to remain true to one's eyes and ears and heart.As teachers and parents, in moments of crisis and conflict, when we face each other, with the full involvement and committment of the self, we realize how impossible it is to maintain an enriching, growing relationship, unless we can face the truth together, unless in our own schools and homes we can be honest with each other.Yet living honestly, being true to one's self, after the bitter experiences of childhood, is often a life-long struggle for adults.To be honest with one's self and in one's relationships with others is exceedingly difficult and painful.Conflicts emerge which challenge us in such a way that our quest for a truthful existence is severely threatened.In the face of truth, we are often forced to cause suffering and grief to others or we ourselves may be deeply hurt.In such moments of conflict, it is much easier to avoid the dilemma, to choose another path, to distort or manipulate the situation, or in some way to avoid facing the painful experience of a confrontation with truth.When I speak of honesty I do not necessarily mean the boldly outspoken beliefs stated aggressively and without reserve, nor do I mean the clever, conscious, thought-out, calculated statements intended to provoke and foment, although honesty may sometimes take these forms.I do not mean honesty which is hostile and destructive, which means to hurt or minimize or destroy.I do not mean the aggressive thrust or challenge which aims to attack.I do not mean the \"holier than thou'~ attitude which limits and restricts.All of these are perversions of simple truth, truth which exists solely because it is a vital piece of self-experience.Honesty, as I know it, means the quiet, direct expressions which sometimes emerge reluctantly, hesitantly and even fearfully.Today, it is not easy to be honest.Status, economic prestige, intelligent manipulation and social approval have higher values.Rarely is honesty the best policy from the stand-",

      "abstract": "WORLDLITERATURETODAY.ORG 17 photo : takahiro yamamoto TO QUESTION THE WILL OF PASSION is to question life itself, and how not to respond to a stimulus, an impulse, a desire? Does not the lower self need as much appeasement as the higher self, and who is to say if any one self is to be sacrificed at the expense of the other? Is it not our duty to harmonize the various selves within our self? The way we integrate mind and body, thought and action, personal life and working life and social life. The many lives we lead must eventually lead to a single ocean of understanding. For in that ocean we can float, we can give up the striving. Five fingers make a hand, that which is effective, that which propels us in our daily rigors. And we never pass judgment on these fingers, never distinguish one as being weak or being strong, one as more important than the other. So also with our desires: what they crave is unanimous acceptance. And there is no reason why we can’t explore our passions and enjoy them with a love for all things alive and breathing. To the enactments of nature we don’t raise condemning eyes; we see the acts for what they are: changing rhythms of the universe. The movement of the tides; the rise and ebb of the sun; the lofty, murky passage of the moon; the shift of seasons; the changing hues of a landscape; the various blushes of a tree, a plant, a flower, a lake, a river, a pond: none of this The Atonement by Murzban F. Shroff fiction 18 WLT JANUARY/ FEBRUARY 2015 appears unnatural or suspicious; rather, we see it as the unfolding of a vast and complex spiritual design, the reliable appearance of cosmic truths. And yet we do an immense disservice to our body, which is nothing but an embodiment of nature. So we bring to it the shallow weights of our opinion. And we deny it its natural rhythms. And we bind it to a moral code not its own. And we give words to its actions where words are entirely unnecessary. Words like “base” and “immoral” and “obscene” and “perverse.” But in the prison cells of our mind we play out these words anyway. Daily we act out our indelicate absorptions, and then step out into the sunlight, all dressed and smiling. The writer writes this sitting on a chair in the principal ’s office. The principal is a short man, bald, vulpine, paunchy, wearing a white robe that hangs off his waist like a tent. Under the robe he wears black socks, under his breath he smiles. The writer is a young man, thirty-four, thirty-five, at the most. His hair is long, he is unshaven, no mustache , but you can tell that his facial growth is light, his complexion clean and youthful. Next to him is his wife—quiet, pensive, and self-contained. She is dressed in tight-fitting clothes: a short-sleeve blouse with stripes of pastel pink and green; white trousers; sandals . She wears no makeup, no lipstick, and clutches a handbag that rests on her lap. The principal’s office is at the end of a long, wooden corridor, lined with wooden benches. The flooring, too, is of wood—dark, ancient wood—and it would pick up the sound of footsteps easily. The writer and his wife have been called to school on a serious matter. It couldn’t have been any more serious than what it was at home. But this: this was about their eight-year-old daughter, Denise. There had been a gangup against her: a mass ragging and humiliation. Why? Why? How could they have done that to her? Other children like her, who had visited their home, been fed and entertained, been taken for a movie, and, thereafter, to a mall. And to think he had thought them so innocent that, looking in their eyes, he had mourned the death of his own innocence, brooded over the corruption of his soul. How had that corruption started?

      "title": "The Resourcefulness of Craft: <i>Whole House Reuse</i>",
      "abstract": "To choose between being resourceful or wasteful is an everyday decision that is often under-valued. It useful to consider what happens when this choice is taken away and wastefulness is forcibly imposed. To see wastefulness occur, when one would rather act resourcefully, is to experience dispowerment, meaninglessness, loss and an external locus of control. To impose wastefulness is to remove an opportunity to experience a significant capability: resourcefulness. In the context of natural disaster, when sudden trauma causes waste to be seen as a minor issue in relation to other acute priorities, opportunities for resourcefulness often become limited, yet are fundamental to building resilience. To be allowed and enabled to be resourceful post-earthquake by being involved in the craft of deconstruction, resource recovery and reuse, where safe and feasible, is to be offered an opportunity to influence the degree of loss and trauma experienced. Being resourceful enables people to begin to regain some sense of control over what is happening to them, and to feel they can make the most of the resources they have. To see demolition as an opportunity for constructive deconstruction and reuse through craft requires an understanding of the benefits of this over a cheap and hasty use of diggers and trucks. Whole House Reuse was a project that involved the full deconstruction and reuse of one home due for demolition that was made possible by over 250 people engaging in craft for reuse. This project demonstrates that craft is vital as a tool in these times when, more than ever, we need to make the most of the resources we have.",

      "abstract": "The dream doesn't always start in the same way. Sometimes I am in a hallway. Other times I am in a lab or a classroom. There are faces surrounding me—some I recognize, some I don't—and there is only one thing I am sure of: I am completely unprepared for this. Sometimes there is a test being passed out. Sometimes I realize there is a big project due, or all of the sudden it is the end of the school year, and I have somehow forgotten or been unable to attend class up until this moment. But now (in my dream) I am there, I am terrified, and I am not ready. I don't have a lot of recurring dreams, so these dreams in which I find myself back at school and completely off-guard have provided much fodder for self-analysis. But I haven't had to delve too deep into my psyche to come to the conclusion that I harbor some serious guilt for never having \"finished\" school.",

      "title": "Always do your best",
      "abstract": "“Always do your best” is the agreement that Ruiz believes will most help the other three agreements. Being our best is about intention. When we intend to do our best, we are relieved from always thinking we should be more and do more. Are there times when we do less than our best? More than our best? Do we know what our best is? Do we even pay attention to such things? Doing less than our best keeps us from feeling satisfied, secure, and fulfilled. We are less vigorous, less vivacious. There can be a domino effect leading from feeling disappointed to feeling hopeless to “I give up. I’m just not good at this.” Some of us may specialize in less than our best. We wing it or make do instead of planning substantial lessons and creating thorough reports. We avoid helping even when we are available. We gossip about students or co- workers. We silently compete with others on the staff. All of us can likely recognize ourselves in each of these moments. It is normal to be “less than our best” at times. Some of us may specialize in doing more than our best. We make commitments that we cannot keep, because we are determined to keep ourselves active. We refuse to take a break, even though we would benefit from fresh air and a change of pace. We know our reputation relies on student achievements, so we invest too heavily in making students appear successful. By now, it may be obvious that our “best” changes. Various factors influence what our best can be on any given day, in any given setting. Sometimes doing “ better” is a reasonable and worthy tar­get: it’s good enough. Adopting the intent to do our best means we can know and accept that whatever our best is in this moment, it’s good enough for now. We can say: “That’s as good as I can do right now.” “This will do for today.”",

      "title": "Intersections of My Lesbian, Feminist, and Activist Identities: Problems and Strategies in Everyday Impression Management",
      "abstract": "The question I ask myself is--how do I want participate in my growth in both personal and public life? I have become aware that as a human being each of my life issues and problems (both large and small) that arise are all important my growth. Do I have a (i.e., one) problem or issue that can be identified and related the universe on a macro level, or are they several? It seems me that all my questions about who I am and who I want become overlap. I am not able see each specific experience as independent of the others. Instead, I perceive each experience as a manifestation of a specific life lesson. Through my exploration of some of my previous and current experiences I hope be led closer this lesson. As a young adult I experienced a shift in consciousness in regards my sexuality. Although I was able reconstruct my self-image after this event, I have not been able let go of the inquisitive perspective toward life that I acquired during my experience. This shift in consciousness has changed my perspective on how I view the world. Until this shift I had not questioned who I was in terms of my senses of myself and the world. This change in the way of looking at the is like taking a phenomenological perspective toward life. According Wallace and Wolf (1999), a phenomenological approach allows people to question our way of looking at and our way of being in the world (1999, pg. 253). A major implication of this shift in consciousness has been my adoption of a feminist perspective towards the micro and macro forces at work in my life. The implication of this is that I am dissatisfied with many institutions, attitudes, and actions within myself and especially in the outside world. I am stuck in a position of trying make some sense of the inequalities that exist in society and focusing on what I can do improve what I perceive be unjust. In order problematize my place in society I must begin with my selves. I use selves, in plural, rather than the singular self because I view each specific issue in my life as one of many waves of experiences that all have contributed where I find myself today. Throughout my life I have experienced shifts in consciousness, behavior, and perspective and have experienced different versions of my selves along the way. I grew up in a white middle-class town, south of Boston, Massachusetts. During my adolescent and teenage years I experienced the average life of a teenage girl. I spent all of my free time with friends, drank alcohol before I was legal and had non-committed relationships with boys. I behaved like others around me and never questioned my reality. I conformed what my family, friends, and society expected of me. After graduating, I wanted experience life far from the small town I grew up in; so I moved Orlando, Florida. The best way describe what my experience was during the year I lived in Orlando is de scribe how I identified my self with others. Lacking any social group at all I met new friends and was able explore my sexuality in a new way. I was kissed by another woman and was shocked into relating women romantically for the first time in my life. This revelation began a two-year struggle with what I thought was my identity. At the time I considered coming out as a lesbian be a lifelong issue but that does not seem be the case any more now that I look back. Rather I see that experience as beginning a process toward how I now view and interact in the world. The first step of this process was the epiphany that my selves had been socially constructed at least in part and I began deconstruct parts of my identity that did not seem coincide with how I felt. The realization that I had acquired an identity that had been shaped by my social environment and was at odds with how I innately felt sparked my opposition the patriarchal structure of society. …",

      "title": "Flirting with death: The effects on relationships of surviving a life-threatening illness",
      "abstract": "Over the course of 20 years' experience counselling more than 600 clients, I have come across many relationships which seem to have been severely compromised by one partner nearly dying. In some cases, the partner of the ill client has withdrawn affection and become cold; in others, the partner has found a lover, ex- or new, temporary or permanent. All of the clients concerned were people with considerable experience of the world. All of them were confused and puzzled by the way the partner reacted to their illness. Some of them had not made the link to their own illness until we uncovered it in counselling. This paper arises out of attempts to make sense of this. Drawing on material from many sources, including work with carers, I suggest that life-threatening illness can be experienced as a flirtation with death, producing something of the same feelings of betrayal in the healthy partner, and, in some cases, some of the same reactions as any other threat of abandonment.",

      "title": "A Different Voice, A Different Autobiography: Letting My Authentic Voice Speak",
      "abstract": "At times it manifests in an unnecessarily loud, aggressive tone of voice or a disproportionate amount of talking rather than listening. Eye rolling, smirking, sighing, and interrupting are also parts of my sometimes-negative communication style. For past few months I have been given unique opportunity to explore my many selves, and my communication issue particularly, on a micro and macro level within framework of various readings, films and discussions on self and society. I have had chance to view an aspect of my life within broader social context and to form linkages between my actions and and world to which I belong. C. Wright Mills points out significance of this when he reminds his readers that fact of his living [the individual] contributes, however minutely, to shaping of society (349). My study did not begin as a desire to deepen my understanding of myself or my selves, or even an aspiration to explore ways in which individuals influence and visa versa. I simply wanted to get some self control in social situations and find a way to be my vocal self without disrespecting others in process. I wanted to look at my empirical self, self that can be studied, as a way of understanding something that is mostly unconscious (Zerubavel, 16). When I decided on topic for my self-exploration I tried to become more conscious of my communication style in various social settings. It was not long before my goal went out window and I found myself right back in my usual ways of acting and reacting in social settings, displaying a trait in human thinking G. I. Gurdjieff calls forgetfulness. Observing this abandonment of very objective of what I had set out to do, as I was going about doing it, solidified importance of personal exploration into reasons behind my ineffective communication style and why I had difficulty breaking away from it. I hoped to understand my motives in a clear, concise way, but have come to realize that this is not a possibility, for human beings are indescribably complex creatures. In writing about motives, author Diane Bjorklund points out that the concept of motivation includes both conscious and unconscious motives and therefore is not limited to voluntary activity as is concept of will (91). In other words, so-called motives behind my communication can not be easily figured out, understood, written about, or changed at conscious level. They are deeply rooted, profoundly multifarious, and forever changing. George Herbert Mead writes about how having many selves is normal. A multiple personality is in a certain sense normal, he writes. ... There is usually an organization of whole self with reference to community to which we belong, and situation in which we find ourselves (24). Actions vary according to inner forces and outer circumstances and are significantly influenced by both. In her chapter on G.I. Gurdjieff's teaching entitled The Psychology of Ordinary Human Beings, Kathleen Speeth explains why in Gurdjieff's view it is important for us, and me, to explore and examine ourselves. It is important to consider our condition as it is now, and condition as it would be if we were to realize possibilities, destiny, to fullest (Speeth, 31). Studying self in this framework gives us an opportunity to observe and examine selves of moment while working toward freeing more essential selves. Self judgment and hatred are thereby removed from equation in Gurdjieff's method of self-observation. In Gurdjieff's view (Speeth, 48), personality is not static; it grows and transforms throughout life course. Individuals go through stages in which they act in specific ways, and even within same life stage different parts of personality emerge in various situations. In this exploration I have found myself questioning my true personality, as if there were such a thing. …",

      "abstract": "Diciembre 2002 • 19-24 • r • Los seres humanos nos vemos en ocasiones sometidos a situaciones de crisis en las que nos sentimos en peligro, sufrimos reveses de todo tipo, etc., que ponen a prueba nuestras capacidades de afrontamiento y que nos obligan a tomar decisiones de las que depende nuestro futuro. Suelen ser hechos puntuales (circunstanciales nos dice la literatura sobre el tema) que afecta al sujeto y a su entorno inmediato. Las reacciones y los efectos correspondientes suelen ser asumidos de distintas formas, pero, y esto es lo normal, quedan en un ambito restringido a la persona y a su familia. Cuando esto ocurre, para la Psicologia, una victima, por el hecho de serlo, resulta afectada en su mundo personal y relacional, fisicamente, respecto a su futuro, etc. Pero todas ellas tienen algo en comun: la afectacion en mayor o menor grado en su integridad y funcionamiento psicologico y emocional. Y estos efectos deben ser atendidos adecuadamente. Pero si damos un paso mas alla nos situamos en lo que podriamos llamar las grandes crisis cuando se deben a hechos o situaciones como las catastrofes y las emergencias. Lo que destaca en ellos es su volumen. Podemos definirlas como sucesos bruscos, inesperados, que afectan a muchas victimas, que sufren principalmente danos en su integridad fisica y/o en sus bienes, o se sienten amenazados en ese sentido. Una caracteristica que podemos adelantar respecto a los desastres, y en menor grado las emergencias, es que sus consecuencias sobrepasan lo particular para incidir tambien en el grupo, en la sociedad. Los efectos de las catastrofes no quedan restringidos al individuo o a la familia solamente, sino que repercuten en el ambito publico y social, originandose una situacion de desconcierto, desamparo y desestructuracion general, que provocan el aumento de los efectos individuales en cantidad e intensidad. Es decir, que podemos distinguir como dos dianas: La persona individual. La sociedad. El nivel de afectados no se limita a las victimas directas, sino que se forman varios circulos en los que quedan incluidos, aparte de las victimas directas, sus familiares, amigos y allegados, companeros, poblaciones proximas, etc., asi como componentes de los servicios asistenciales que intervienen, con lo que se multiplican los perjudicados, y, por tanto el numero de personas que necesitan ser atendidas.",

      "abstract": "Problem Statement: Grief is not a disease or a sign of weakness. We experience this emotional turbulence as we progress in life. Any significant loss can trigger feelings of emptiness and searching for internal resources to heal and to move on. Purpose: Where grief is our natural response to loss, bereavement implicates death of a loved one. This rollercoaster process of adaptation to an irreplaceable loss can vary in people. What helps us cope in grief is our support system, our beliefs as well as looking at future. Methods: Focus group intervention for grief was done by using The Brief COPE that measures the frequency of engaging in behavioural and cognitive strategies for coping with general life stressors. Results: Responses showed recent deaths, to loss of romantic relationships and break ups in friendships as the antecedents to ongoing grief. To overcome feelings of despair, people engaged into act of kindness towards someone to relieve sadness. Gratitude was seen as a protective factor towards grief especially in the younger population. Conclusion: Any form of grief brings with it vulnerability and needs time to recover. It is vital to look for coping skills where self-care is most important. Coping skills were discussed where journaling thoughts, opening to friends, and seeking professional help were seen to be most favourable.",

When we meet someone new, we often think we like them more than they like us back. This gap between how much we like others and think others like us is called a liking gap. It happens because we worry about the impression we make on others. Even children experience this liking gap, but it only starts around 5 years old. At this age, the liking gap is still small. It gets bigger as children get older, probably because they start to better understand that what they do influences what others think of them.

      "abstract": "Spiritual growth is a journey. Most of us grow from our childhood view of the spiritual world to a more rational view that we call adult. Perhaps, the child's view is more comforting and satisfying. The pattern of universe is such that to have life to continue, there will need to be loss and death. Anger is also a common reaction when faced with our own inability to control forces in our life. Anger often happens when it seems that we need control for our own happiness and well-being. If something occurs which seems to threaten our happiness and well-being, we often react with anger. Guilt is another common method of coping. All of us, and especially children, are especially prone to guilt. Children have great imaginations. Friendship is a powerful form of coping. People may be the best source of help. Friends share their joys and their sorrows.",

Many parents fear that a well-adjusted, happy, healthy child or teenager may abruptly self-injure or even commit suicide because of cyberbullying. Bullying can be scary for the same reason, but digital problems really lend themselves to this type of fear, because parents often feel that they are barely treading water when it comes to keeping on top of what their children are up to online. Although social problems can cause kids distress and even depression, cyberbullying is not implicated any more strongly than are other types of social difficulties. When we look at the cases where cyberbullying is implicated in a suicide, we almost always see that the child in question was already struggling with depression and/or other emotional challenges. When kids are able to talk with their parents and families about their troubles, resiliency rises.",

Is it true that people with “hurry sickness” suffer heart attacks, and worriers develop ulcers, and shy people face cancer? Is relaxation an elixir, and will having a smile on your face make you live longer? The relationships among individual differences, disease, and health have been investigated scientifically for more than 100 years, and many thousands of findings have been reported. The general verdict (subject to numerous exceptions and qualifications) is that a person who is chronically irritated, depressed, hostile, impulsive, bored, frustrated, lonely, or powerless is indeed more likely to develop illnesses and to die prematurely than is someone who generally feels emotionally balanced and effective, is in a satisfying job, has stable and supportive social relationships, and is well integrated into the community (Booth-Kewley &amp; Friedman, 1987; Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1991; Friedman &amp; Booth-Kewley, 1987; House, Landis, &amp; Umberson, 1988; Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser, Cacioppo, &amp; Malarkey, 1998; Miller, Smith, Turner, Guijarro, &amp; Hallett, 1996; Repetti, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2002; Smith &amp; Gallo, 2001).

      "title": "Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events?",
      "abstract": "Many people are exposed to loss or potentially traumatic events at some point in their lives, and yet they continue to have positive emotional experiences and show only minor and transient disruptions in their ability to function. Unfortunately, because much of psychology’s knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological. The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma is more common than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience. M ost people are exposed to at least one violent or life-threatening situation during the course of their lives (Ozer, Best, Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). As people progress through the life cycle, they are also increasingly confronted with the deaths of close friends and relatives. Not everyone copes with these potentially disturbing events in the same way. Some people experience acute distress from which they are unable to recover. Others suffer less intensely and for a much shorter period of time. Some people seem to recover quickly but then begin to experience unexpected health problems or difficulties concentrating or enjoying life the way they used to. However, large numbers of people manage to endure the temporary upheaval of loss or potentially traumatic events remarkably well, with no apparent disruption in their ability to function at work or in close relationships, and seem to move on to new challenges with apparent ease. This article is devoted to the latter group and to the question of resilience in the face of loss or potentially traumatic events. The importance of protective psychological factors in the prevention of illness is now well established (Taylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower, & Gruenewald, 2000). Moreover, developmental psychologists have shown that resilience is common among children growing up in disadvantaged conditions (e.g., Masten, 2001). Unfortunately, because most of the psychological knowledge base regarding the ways adults cope with loss or potential trauma has been derived from individuals who have experienced significant psychological problems or sought treatment, theorists working in this area have often underestimated and misunderstood resilience, viewing it either as a pathological state or as something seen only in rare and exceptionally healthy individuals. In this article, I challenge this view by reviewing evidence that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma represents a distinct trajectory from that of recovery, that resilience is more common than often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.",

      "abstract": "My first inclination to this prompt, what of Black temporalities in crisis, was to ask a small group of Black familiars (friends and colleagues) to talk with me about their current experience of time in quarantine, and under the present articulations of racial injustice and economic crisis. Many remarked on awaiting moments of dance and embodiment, or the body after surgery during COVID, to the forms of mutual aid arriving, just on time. Others expressed holding patterns of rage, when being called forth in work environments to engage in conversations about race, others of the crushing aftermath of an intimate partnership in quarantine that went awry, only to arrive at new forms of intimacy in self-reflection and community co-counseling, or deep expressions of freedom, when invited to social distance with a family member, and doing so outside clothing. Still others reflected on mourning a relative, loved one, distant friend, and the uncertainty of the living body, through measures that are within and outside of human control. As the call for this special issue of SAQ noted, “Black temporalities of crisis might consist of subtle, collective and individual experiences of anticipation, drawn-out boredom, acceleration, or the feeling that something has ended before something else begins, among other possibilities.” In this instance, I focus on how the stretchy drawn-out and quickening qualities of time in crisis persist. By drawing on the anonymous experiences of loved ones and moments of rebellion toward fugitivity (e.g., the maroon communities of the Great Dismal Swamp and Harriet Jacobs’s neo–slave narrative), I ruminate on the in-between moments of Black life that show up in and around ongoing crisis.",

      "abstract": "Depending on its reason, a crisis can last a time and needs patience and persistence to be solved. First, you feel the shot and realize what is happening. Then, you will probably remain shocked for some time, and you will need time to manage the crisis and get back on your feet. Moreover, you must consider, that after the end of the acute crisis, that a recovery period will be necessary to adapt yourself to the new environment and stand up again. During that time frame, it could be extremely hard to go ahead with your clinical and scientific career (e.g., learning new skills or carrying on new research), and you can feel scared. Because we humans are programmed to be skeptical when it comes to change-although it is an eternal constant. Also do not be afraid of wasting or losing time: even if it will take months to solve the issue, this time will not be wasted. You will have found a new balance, and, more importantly, you will have learned important skills how to manage a difficult situation and be ready for the next one. The term \"crisis\" means originally \"separation\". This can reflect both the need of a choice and the fact that, after a crisis, you will not be the same. Despite being unpleasant, a crisis can be an opportunity for your life and your career-it can make you understand what you really want, depending on your ideas and your ambitions. A re-establishment of your environment can be fruitful for your career and your motivation-so do not hesitate to embrace change and learn from it.",

Bad habits engender weakness of will and uncertainty of temperament. Parents and teachers regard it as their bounden duty to instil good habits in the minds of the young.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this original research was to describe the lived experience and meaning of a serious fall to independently residing older adults. A qualitative phenomenological approach was utilized with a purposive sample of 19, independent, high-level functioning older adult residents of a Continuing Care Retirement Community to describe their most serious fall and its personal meaning. Traced through multiple data sources, interpretive analysis of the language expressed by older adults were integrated to support emergent themes, which were then validated with secondary samples. Demographic, functional, activity, fall and injury histories were obtained. A serious fall was distinct from other falls because they were sudden, unpredictable events happening during usual activities like walking or showering. These falls were perceived “serious” because they changed life [as they knew it], signaling aging, fear of potential disability or a need to take preventive action. Most experienced distressful emotional responses such as anger, frustration, fear of falling or disability, trauma, pain, helplessness, hopelessness and embarrassment, while four encountered physical injury. A serious fall was perceived differently to study participants than other prior falls. This finding suggests the impact a serious fall has in the life of an older adult, needs to be fully explored during an individualized post fall assessment. Important discovery of a serious fall’s impact on the emotional, functional and social well being of the older adult can then guide an appropriate post-fall plan of care. Although the data were acquired years ago, the meaning of a “serious” fall by an older adult possessed enduring outcomes of a ‘changed life’, i.e., altered personal, social and functional self. The significance of this finding warrants additional study to test the notion of a ‘serious fall’ in contemporary times. Moreover, study findings suggest additional inquiry of older adults’ person-derived approaches to manage their serious fall. Additional inquiry will help develop predictive models of how older adults can best manage a serious fall and its impact.",

      "title": "Silent Scream: The Cost of Crucifixion—Working With a Patient with an Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "In working with individuals who have experienced extreme deprivation in early relationships, the pain is often depicted silently and repetitively. There can be a tension between the need for validation and an avoidance of growth. The analyst, then, can find herself caught between her empathic resonance to the silent scream and the need to keep in mind the “cost of crucifixion.” The latter has become my inner way of fixing in my own mind the type of dilemma that ensues when the individual truly feels helpless and at the mercy of outside sources and also resents and fears the other's power. Marking (and often magnifying) the distress, then, becomes a way of inviting salvation. The dramatic element lends an air of inauthenticity to what is, in fact, very real pain. If we are unable to note the air of dissonance with which we receive these distress calls, we miss a crucial healing element: that the self is payinga hugeprice for defining the other as a source of salvation, and that part of the distress ensues from the denial of the hostility expressed toward the object for being an insufficient savior. We find ourselves cast in the role of savior/persecutor, and must find some means for healing these splits so that we might become a deidealized support for the other's emerging attempts toward constructing a more viable self. This is a dilemma we encounter when working with individuals who communicate protosymbolically, as is the case with eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "All pain is lonely. When extreme, suffering isolates the sufferer in an agony which no pity, however compassionate, can mitigate or share. In such circumstances, the more pity yearns to reach out, the more futile and helpless it seems. Great suffering makes pity confront its own piteousness: pity itself becomes piteable. Rescue requires action. Yet, when pain is beyond help, pity is made to suffer the agony of its own inability to act. The yearning to rescue helplessness is itself helpless and needs help. This is the point of imaginary breakthrough where, through the sheer agony of helpless grief, pity fulfills its dearest wish of assuming or absorbing the helpless suffering by which it is evoked. The helplessness of the suffering victim is transformed into the helplessness of the one who pities him or her. Helplessness rescues helplessness. This is the deepest fantasy of human pity and the chief reason why pity tends to manifest itself as helpless anguish.",

      "title": "Unhinged: A Prospective Perspective on Being Unsafe<sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the unprecedented events unfolding around the globe over the past four years, psychoanalytic communities near and far have sought to ask and ventured to answer the question: What does psychoanalysis have to offer individuals, and the collective, as a way of seeing and being with the reality of what is? Taking up these questions in such a time as this, feels, perhaps inevitably, unsafe. Sometimes it can feel as if there is a silent and unspoken mandate to ensure safety at all costs when we seek to find a spirit of the depth’s response to the spirit of the times. I propose that the work of psychoanalysis is grounded in nothing but the journey through that which is unsafe. This article will take up Ann Ulanov’s notion that one’s own evil is the hinge door into collective and archetypal evil. To become unhinged means to risk well‐formulated understandings, theories, and modalities about being and becoming for the other and instead to allow the other to penetrate that which is unknown in ourselves, upending our well‐formed theories and pressing us to take up our own lives in new and unpredictable ways.",

This anger is usually in response to feeling unloved or rejected. One way in which this appears clinically is a harsh superego that leaves the patient constantly and cruelly wanting to achieve a state of self-contained perfection. This is the result of projective identification processes in which the desire and demand for an ideal object is put into the object and experienced as both conscious and unconscious judgement, rigidity and expectation. Naturally, this means the patient is always failing themselves and attacking themselves or others for being less than ideal. One case will be explored to understand certain aspects of this problem.",

      "abstract": "The anxiety over death persists in everyday life- though often denied or repressed- lingering as an unconscious worry or intuition that typically seems to compromise one's feelings of well-being and experience in a range of areas; coming out often as malaise, depression, and anger in much conduct. If one accepts the cliché that life is preparation for death, we must accept that the lived experience of the dying body is not highlighted merely in obvious cases of deterioration such as in the ageing or diseased body, but in everyday life as a normal phenomenon. This book proposes that sensitivity to this dimension can empower us to develop creative relationships to the vulnerability of others and to ourselves as well. Part One lays the groundwork for a study of the ways the aura and fear of death recurs as a constant premonition in life and how people try to deal with this uneasiness. Part Two then goes on to apply this focus to particular concerns and problems such as dementia, depression, aging, retirement, and a range of anxieties, frustrations and aggressions. The Dying Body as Lived Experience will be of interest to a wide interdisciplinary audience in the health sciences, in the sociology of health and illness, philosophy, bioethics and in the expanding field of medical humanities.",

Are thoughts and fears of death something that is normal and healthy or should we view them as a sign of an emotional disturbance? Answers to these and similar questions are critical to all who live, work, and interact with children. For those who are familiar with the available research on the subject or those who have been observing and listening to children in their families or in nearby surroundings, the answers are obvious. Of course children are concerned about death. Children have a basic need to make sense of the world and of themselves in it. In their own way they seek answers to existential questions much as we adults do. Children are curious about all aspects of life. Death, with its many manifestations, is among those aspects. Sometimes the ways in which death presents itself and is interpreted are powerful, strange, and confusing; at other times they are casual, familiar, and clear. But we should not doubt that death is a part of the child's world. To believe otherwise means that we greatly underestimate the motivations and capacities of our young. To ignore these facts may cause us to leave many children with distorted views and understandings and with fears that threaten the child's basic sense of security.",

It seems that we have been designed so that intimacy must always include both. In my psychoanalytic psychotherapy practice in New York City, it has always beenthe case that almost all the single men and women I see, and almost all the divorced or considering being divorcedmen and women I see, are struggling with intimacy: loving and being loved. Many people present with depression stemming from painful feelings of loneliness, and with frustration and discouragement about being able to create and sustain an intimate relationship that feels passionate and alive, and at the same time safe and dependable. According to Aron (1991), their analysts have similar struggles:I believe that people who are drawn to analysis as a profession have particularly strong conflicts regarding their desire to be known by another, that is, conflicts regarding intimacy … Why else would people choose a profession in which they spend their lives listening and looking into the lives of others while they themselves remain relatively silent and hidden?",

      "abstract": "Abstract Grief is a complex emotional experience or process, which is typically felt in response to the death of a loved one, most typically a family member, child, or partner. Yet the way in which grief manifests is much more complex than this. The things we grieve over are multiple and diverse. We may grieve for a former partner after the breakup of a relationship; parents sometimes report experiencing grief when their grown-up children leave the family home. We can also experience grief for people we have never met. Indeed, it is not just persons that we may grieve for. People report feeling grief over the death of their pets, or about the destruction the natural environment. In all these cases one factor that seems to stand out is loss . Despite being about very different things, these various forms of grief all involve a loss of some sort. Yet there is a further aspect of grief, which, on the face of it, does not quite follow this pattern. Grief can also be experienced before a loss has occurred. Grief can be experienced while the person that one is grieving for is still living and before one has (fully) suffered the loss. This phenomenon is known as anticipatory grief . The experience of anticipatory grief is a complex phenomenon, which resists easy classification. Nonetheless, we suggest that mental time travel, our ability to mentally project ourselves into the personal past (episodic memory) and personal future (episodic prospection), is a key mechanism that underpins experiences of anticipatory grief. Anticipatory grief can still be understood in terms of loss, but it is a loss that is brought to mind through memory and imagination.",

      "title": "Lebensalter und Verzweiflung",
      "abstract": "Despair is something very human, or even specifically human. We can observe animals mourning, but they are lacking the insight that the pain is inescapable. Despair is not only the business of psychiatrists but also of philosophers and theologians. Despair is a state, not a diagnosis like melancholy or depression. Theologians made these fine differentiations: accedia, tristitia and desperatio. As depression is not mourning and is also something else than despair. Despair is more vivacious than mourning or bitterness because there is also a rage that one's hope is destroyed. The philosopher Kierkegaard again and again dealt with the term despair. He even stated that human beings cannot not be desperate and it is a misfortune if someone has never been desperate. Despair is experienced differently through the different phases of life. There are also different causes. A crying baby who is hungry can at first sight be perceived as being desperate. There is a lack of hopelessness though. A toddler, however, who has lost his mother on a shopping tour can feel very hopeless. Adolescents can truly feel hopeless and desperate. They can shed bitter tears making the experience that they are not being understood.This abysmal feeling of not being understood or that someone does not want to understand often happens in that phase of life. In adult life other situations are typical for despair, especially when harm can be foreseen and how it could be prevented but it is impossible to translate it into action. The older we are the more likely are irretrievable losses, e.g. losses of beloved ones. At old age the own force decreases and the number of the losses increases. These narcissistic offences lead to a higher suicide rate among elderly people. This kind of hopelessness can be seen as despair but also as resignation or capitulation. Positive resignation and renunciation make it possible for elderly people to meet the inescapable experiences of loss. Working with depressive people means to look for the reasons of their despair, but also to feel desperate when there seems to be no way to help them. Every attempt to help the patient bounces off - because he insists on his hallucinations or she on her suicide ideas. The patient is blocking everything until the therapist also gets hopeless and sees no way out. Only when the patient feels the deep hopelessness and the true interest of his psychiatrist can he enter into a therapeutic alliance. Many strange ways in the history of psychiatry may be attempts of desperate psychiatrists to deal with the despair of their patients.",

In a theater story, one partner (or sometimes both partners) engage(s) in a role. The relationship is like theater. The role or roles may change, but the theatrical aspect never does. In a humor story, jokes, lightheartedness, and seeing the funny side of things predominate. Any attempt at a serious or even conflictual conversation is likely to be diverted by humor. In a mystery story, one of the partners seems continually to be shrouded in a cloak of mystery, and the relationship evolves as the other partner tries, never completely successfully, to penetrate the shroud. Usually, as soon as one shroud is penetrated, another quickly takes its place.",

Then even the most articulate thinker will tend to descend to clichés (“Trust is important”; “Love is beautiful”; “Live free or die”). Everyone knows trust is important. The question is how we understand trust, and, more important, how we can build trust rather than simply assert its importance. Building trust begins with an honest understanding of trust, but it also requires everyday routines and practices. Without the practices, that understanding comes to nothing. It is now commonplace for couples and companies to participate in offsite retreats or hire short‐term counselors or consultants to transform the relationship or the corporate culture into one of trust.

The origin of this is nothing but the guilt we feel when we transgress the rules imposed on us, the desires of others, our own fear of not being loved, or the need for approval.",

At the time, he felt stuck financially and professionally, and found himself in constant conflict with his parents and many in his wide family and social circle. It soon came to light that drinking and substance use would also need to be addressed, and now, sober for about the last three years and more comfortable with himself and others, Michael felt ready, probably for the first time in his life, to meet and date men with the potential to become long-term partners rather than merely discardable sexual objects. Deeply longing for, but yet afraid and unsure of how to navigate intimacy, loneliness and its sometimes seemingly impossible antidotes now consumed our therapeutic hours. Narcissistic defenses were no longer as effective as they used to be; sadness, the pain of aloneness, often permeated. As is the paradox in these situations, we felt more good than not about having arrived at this difficult place. Still, we struggled.",

Hope may be expressed in change and transformation, but also more modest forms of patience and enduring. While often called to the fore in moments of crisis and transition, hope is above all a property of ordinary work, from whence comes it depth and power. Finally, hope is a collective accomplishment – something we do together in the world, in concert with others and with things.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

Spinoza’s view is that we need not and should not surrender to a life of passivity and unhappiness. Although invulnerability is impossible, we can achieve a robust level of self-determination and happiness. We can take care of ourselves and have good lives. But taking care of oneself is something to be achieved. This chapter shows that Spinozistic tenacity is the intelligent care of oneself through hardship, setbacks, and misfortune. It is empowered self-love. It is empowered self-love because, as a species of strength of character, it is both a type of intelligence and a form of strength and resilience.",

The persistence of such questions may signal the insatiability of our human curiosity, but they also offer evidence of our possibly endless search for substantive, finite meaning. We yearn to identify who we are and to be part of something greater than our own limited individuality. This desire leads people to draw strong, even vicious, us-versus-them boundaries in political and social life. But it is also a spiritual wish to connect to all of humanity, indeed to all of life and the cosmos, and to take benevolent action accordingly (Figure 1.1, chapter opener). Even when answers to our questions about identity prove inconclusive, changeable, or otherwise unsatisfying, our search continues apace.",

The past is represented as intruding on the present either in the form of \"ghosts\" and memories, or in the form of \"memory traces.\" Total psychological recovery is presented as being impossible, although all four protagonists are in a better mental state at the close of each novel than they were at the beginning. The protagonist is assisted by someone outside the family, who guides them towards recovery and enables them to strengthen his or her sense of self.",

They are unwilling to give up and allow repossession, but they cannot recover. This is situated through Berlant’s cruel optimism, where the object of our desire is ultimately harmful to our flourishing. Debtors remember the dream they had (see Chapter 3) of a good life, and it is this belief that they can recapture this vision of a good life which encourages them not to give up. Girard’s concepts of mimesis, scapegoating, and sacrifice are used to explain how debtors engage in the coping process. They come to believe that there are dishonest debtors out there who are living the good life thanks to their dishonesty. Some of these debtors come to believe that some mortgagors must be sacrificed through eviction in order for the system to remain stable. Others become determined to resist neoliberal norms and begin to adopt a destructive and toxic attitude towards their creditors. For example, they often refuse to pay even though they are able, coming to willingly embody the creditor stereotype of the professional or reckless debtor.",

Machiavelli says that if you must choose, choose to be feared rather than to be loved. He neglects an alternative that calls for special courage. Since you cannot control other people’s feelings, address your own. Do you have the courage to love and respect your followers? Last is the courage to leave office, to take turns leading and following. Such courage is essential to democracy. By showing courage you give your followers something in you to admire; perhaps it is better for a leader to be admired than to be loved or feared.",

      "abstract": "Maybe the authentic self, should it be there, is not discoverable by a conscious effort. Self-consciousness, inescapable posturing, cognitive biases all interfere with finding it. What if, however, the authentic self is less a thing to be known than an experience to be had and, bizarrely, an experience of that true self's own escape from self-consciousness? Losing track of the self as self may be a way of finding it. (Sounds kind of flaky – if, like me, you resist it as so much chuckle-headed nonsense – or Buddhist if you wish to vest it with worthier authority.) There has been floating around since the romantic period an idea that one can achieve certain grand epiphanies of self-realization in moments claimed to have a supra-authenticity to them, and that these in turn are often triggered by confrontations with the beautiful and the sublime in nature and in art. But since when does the contemplation of the beautiful or the sublime necessarily lead to escaping self-consciousness any more than it is likely to bring in its wake instead a whole assortment of worries about whether you are feeling deeply enough or whether others will think you a phony for looking as if you are feeling too deeply? The pure experience of the aesthetic does not escape the long shadow of faking it. Unmediated unself-conscious immersion into the beautiful is often something that must be worked at, struggled for, or, if we are lucky, achieved as a gift of grace.",

We enter what author Robert Quinn calls the fundamental state of leadership. This is a frame of mind we tend to adopt when facing a significant challenge: a promotion opportunity, the risk of professional failure, a serious illness, a divorce, the death of a loved one, or any other major life jolt. Crisis calls, and we rise to the occasion. But we don't need to spend time in the dark night of the soul to reach this fundamental state. We can make the shift at any time by asking ourselves-and honestly answering--four transformative questions: Am I results centered? (Am I willing to leave my comfort zone to make things happen?) Am I internally directed? (Am I behaving according to my values rather than bending to social or political pressures?) Am I other focused? (Am I putting the collective good above my own needs?) Am I externally open? (Am I receptive to outside stimuli that may signal the need for change?) When we can answer these questions in the affirmative, we're prepared to lead in the truest sense. Of course, we can't sustain the fundamental state of leadership indefinitely. Fatigue and external resistance pull us out of it. But each time we reach it, we then return to our everyday selves a bit more capable, and we usually boost the performance of the people around us. Over time, we create a high-performance culture--and that can be sustained.",

The well-worn reassurance that confidence will only come with experience is of little comfort to the beginner.

      "abstract": "Generally, lyric poems support or protect small and humble things more than brilliant and great things. And this result stem partly from a sense of alienation or loss that he has felt in the process of growth and daily life. Especially it isn't disconnected with fragmented modern society and condition of life that poems of today are based on minor details or solitary experience. However, more fundamental cause to song such things is because of basic self-estrangement or solitude which cannot be solved by logic or reason as a being. Also, fundamental emptiness or deficiency of a person which cannot be filled with ideology or moral principle makes poets themselves peripheral beings. And they raise a question about conditions of human beings themselves inseparable from peripheral beings. That is, the fact that one cannot communicate with one another or the peripheral world surrounding himself, makes poets pursue a certain meeting with some reality sincerely. Commonly identified in most poems, an individual's deep scar or pain, waiting or longing are an effort to overcome such a gap and void. It's the poets that want to have nostalgia of human nature for happy and perfect being as an organized body before having been abstracted by language. That is to say, the poetic peripheral refers to an exceptional event or a surplus phenomenon which cannot be understood or solved by a logic or ideology in the nature, society or history. Also, creation of poems is still uncontrollable and it is one of motions which communicate with the internal of a human being that cannot be substantialized. Something refusing to enter the symbolic world from the outside a center or system, namely, an exception and singularity that poets frequently note are the poetic periphery. Accordingly, the poet's action to regain cosmic rhythm momently and temporarily is not never peripheral. Normally, poetic language which have been regarded as a powerless and worthless thing, is closely linked with the divided gap of universality that have controled and restricted all human beings' action, namely, is connected with a point of exception that the effect of universality has been rejected and has been canceled. Therefore, the peripheral as poets' common interests in all ages, are closely connected with realizing their special position as the peripheral being of universe, and at the same time, it's also connected with 'the moment of decision' when they have to break up with their life style and way of thinking that have dominated them. Poetic catastrophe and shock which suddenly come and destroy ordinary order and rhythm, lead to the realization of individuality and particularity that cannot be captured by any universality, and they make their position to the center. Anyway the will and endeavor to make poets exceptional beings of their period and history are not just escape or helplessness, but they are a motion to stand as a awakened being about themselves and the world around them.",

The chapter uses auto/biographical, narrative material and an interdisciplinary psychosocial framing to consider the role and nature of adult education in these encounters. An adult education with space to tell and share stories, and to feel viscerally welcomed by the other; where we can come to appreciate common, vulnerable humanity as well as conviviality, generating in turn generosity and collaborative learning. There can be a strong spiritual sensibility in these encounters, where mercy, pity, truth and love find expression, and the dynamics of self/other recognition are realized in good enough ways.

      "abstract": "Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe’s couplet’s: “Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.”",

Feelings of helplessness, denial and shame often make it difficult for people with in the early stages of dementia to accept what is happening to them. Those who are in close contact with such individuals, or who have no contact with dementia at all, can find it hard to imagine what this feels like, to misplace things constantly or not to remember what people are called. As we mature, we constantly learn how to communicate, how to use tools, how to interact with our environment and we develop confidence in our senses. But what must it be like to experience the opposite? With the objects developed in the Sensual Fake series, people are challenged to question their senses and experience some of the emotions that people living with dementia go through every day.",

He works for an anti-Semitic company in which his role, in personnel, is to enforce that policy by denying employment to Jews. It is not something he questions but there are few things that he questions. He is a conformist who finds protection, if not meaning, in blending in. His small acts of resistance are so refined as to escape attention by anything but what he takes to be his own exquisitely refined sensibility. He paints his shutters a slightly different shade of green from those of his neighbours, neighbours with whom, for the most part, he abhors to socialise. Indeed, he feels a certain repulsion from personal contact. A single man who lives with his mother, he avoids commitments, accepting prevailing orthodoxies, drifting on the tide of his own disinterest, until suddenly his world begins to collapse and he is forced, literally and symbolically, to see the world anew. He is slowly taken apart and, finally, reconstructed, a new man.",

In today's technical and increasingly impersonal world there is danger that children will find it even more difficult to give up the self-centeredness that accompanies the need for care and attention than did their parents or siblings a few years earlier.

To achieve their aims they employ a variety of techniques and methods, the primary one being to work themselves into the confidence of significant individuals who have the required information and elicit it from them. At the same time, very much aware that that what they are told may not correspond to the reality of the situation, not to put too fine a point on it, may be downright lies, deliberate ploys to mislead, bluffs and counter-bluffs, they must constantly observe and monitor the fit between what they hear and the events which they witness. Often the work requires learning how to decipher obscure messages, recognising code-names and painstakingly assembling disparate and discrete pieces of data into a unified whole in order to make sense of the wider picture.

Lifetime losses are those events which occur throughout the lives, events which mark a change, a transition from something that was to something that is now or will be. A significant area of losses occurs among the relationships people have with those important to them. Other losses occur as friendships change, moves are made, job changes take place. Major losses are experienced as loved ones die throughout the lives, or as marital relationships break down, resulting in separation, divorce and family disruption. Some of the losses people experience are more subtle, more symbolic in nature. Many of the losses could be called developmental or transitional losses—those which occur as a result of normal changes and developments in the lives of most of them. Situational losses come out of specific, unexpected events which do not occur to all people.",

Adictions, afections, fears and the possible lost of what has become a new family, doesn't allow them to leave.

      "abstract": "Having clear boundaries is essential to a healthy, balanced lifestyle. A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.",

      "title": "Autonomy and Authenticity as Ideals of Agency",
      "abstract": "When thinking about the good life, we probably first think of things like a comfortable home, a satisfying career, meaningful relationships, good food, and involvement in worthwhile causes like reducing world hunger or improving education. But literature and life are replete with individuals who have these things but still find their life lacking. Tolstoy’s crisis recounted in Confession, for example, arose in the midst of a flourishing estate, recognized masterpieces, and a provided-for family. The supposed elements of a rich and satisfying life still lacked the meaning he had hoped for. On reflection, then, the good life involves more than a checklist of desirable things and activities. We don’t just want meaningful relationships and successful careers. We want something more. But what exactly is this elusive extra? Often, people describe it as our desire to live lives that are truly our own or, more technically put, to live autonomous and/or authentic lives.In this dissertation, I examine autonomy and authenticity as ways of explaining how an action or a life could be an agent’s own. On my account, autonomy and authenticity both depend on one’s practical identity. Autonomy is a matter of acting in conformity with one’s practical identity and authenticity is a matter of the agent taking ownership and responsibility for her practical identity. After developing accounts of autonomy and authenticity, I examine two further questions. I first examine how autonomy and authenticity can come into conflict in an individual. For example, how can living autonomously threaten an agent’s ability to live an authentic life? And, second, I examine the relationship between a self-conception and a practical identity and their effect on an agent’s ability to live an autonomous and/or authentic life. I suggest that both autonomy and authenticity highlight important aspects of a rich human life. And if we ignore either, it will be to our conceptual peril, holding us back from a fuller understanding of the ways our lives can be (or, conversely, can fail to be) our own.",

We’re prone to envy because we care about ourselves: we all have visions for how we want our lives to go. The dangers posed by envy and jealousy are due not to the feelings themselves, but the ways we cope with them. Jealous lovers think that if they can control their partner’s every move, they don’t have to worry about the threat of the rival. If I can destroy the good that I want that my neighbour enjoys, I don’t have to be reminded of what I lack. We reach for coping mechanisms because we refuse to just feel the pain and insecurity that envy and jealousy involve. If we just felt them and admitted it, they’d do far less damage.",

Like self-defence, consent, duress, insanity and mistake of law, necessity is rooted in moral intuitions about when conduct which causes harm to another's person or property is not wrong, or should be tolerated, permitted or praised. If a man is literally starving to death and steals a loaf of bread, we are reluctant to say that his extreme circumstances should make no difference at all to the way we treat him at trial. And if two men, adrift at sea, are clinging to a log which can only support the weight of one, we are once again reluctant to say that if one pushes the other off the log, it is just a case of murder. These intuitions are deepseated; but it is extremely difficult to articulate the defence they seem to support, or to isolate the circumstances which mark the difference between a situation where the defence ought to apply and where it ought not.",

In facing death, a patient suffers spiritual pain and needs spiritual care. This paper describes what spirituality and spiritual pain mean. It identifies nine types of fears and anxieties about death which become a source of spiritual pain: 1. Fear of pain; 2. Fear of loneliness; 3. Fear of unpleasant experiences; 4. Fear of becoming a burden to the family and to society; 5. Anxiety towards the unknown; 6. Fear of death resulting from fear of life; 7. Fear of death as a feeling that one's life task is still incomplete; 8. Fear of death as fear of personal extinction; 9. Fear of death as fear of judgment and punishment after death. Five types of spiritual pain that seem to be frequent among patients facing death are discussed: 1. Loss of self-determination; 2. Loss of meaning; 3. Guilt feelings; 4. Loneliness and isolation; 5. Loss of hope. Three ways of preventing or reducing excessive fear of death and of lowering the various types of spiritual pain are suggested: 1. Death education; 2. Presence at the bedside; 3. Humor as an expression of love.",

We not only make others happy with simple words of love and praise, but we also feel a lot better about ourselves and our lives. Gratitude is about having the right feelings at the right time about the right things. It's inextricably linked to self-control and motivation. It may not provide immediate relief from pain and stress, but it restores our sense of control. Gratitude is a tool for increasing happiness in the context of positive psychology. The benefits of gratitude are not linked to any sort of pathology or religion, but rather to a desire to create healthy and thriving people and societies. As the preceding paragraphs demonstrated, there are numerous ways to express gratitude. Maybe it's a gratitude journal, or maybe it's treating a stranger with kindness because someone did something nice for you. Try practising gratitude the next time you have some free time. You might be surprised by the advantages it provides. Please share your thoughts and experiences with this important emotion, as always.",

      "title": "Necessary connections: ‘Feelings photographs’ in criminal justice research",
      "abstract": "Visual representations of prisons and their inmates are common in the news and social media, with stories about riots, squalor, drugs, self-harm and suicide hitting the headlines. Prisoners’ families are left to worry about the implications of such events on their kin, while those incarcerated and less able to understand social cues, norms and rules, are vulnerable to deteriorating mental health at best, to death at worst. As part of the life-story method in my research with offenders who are on the autism spectrum, have mental health problems and/or have learning difficulties, and prisoner’s mothers, I asked participants to take photographs, reflecting upon their experiences. Photographs, in this case, were primarily used to help respondents consider and articulate their feelings in follow-up interviews. Notably, seeing (and imagining) is often how we make a connection to something (object or feeling), or someone (relationships), such that images in fiction, news/social media, drama, art, film and photographs can shape the way people think and behave – indeed feel about things and people. Images and representations ought to be taken seriously in researching social life, as how we interpret photographs, paintings, stories and television shows is based on our own imaginings, biography, culture and history. Therefore, we look at and process an image before words escape, by ‘seeing’ and imagining. How my participants and I ‘collaborate’ in doing visual methods and then how we make meaning of the photographs in storying their feelings, is insightful. As it is, I wanted to enable my participants to make and create their own stories via their photographs and narratives, while connecting to them, along with my own interpretation and subjectivities.",

Their motivation may be deeprooted and emotional, or may arise from a conscious decision made in early adulthood. Some motivation is flawed and fails early. Other motivation may be eroded by a single dangerous event, by an accumulation of \"close calls\" (one's own or others'), or by a growing interest in nonaviation elements. Since Air Force fliers may \"quit\" only at some personal cost to pride or pocketbook, they may develop a fear of flying. This may be truly phobic, a situational reaction, or an awareness of personal vulnerability. Some displace anxiety about flying into somatic symptoms. The author discusses motivation to fly, its various modes of failure, and some clinical aspects of fear of flying.",

Hope, which Aristotle called a \"waking dream,\" is associated with imagination, daydreams, and wishful thinking. Willing, on the other hand, is aligned with practical effort, discipline, and acting against one's inclinations. Despite their lack of obvious affinity, in some communities-especially in the face of extreme suffering-the two acts may develop a close kinship. Hope as a moral task, even a narrative quest, can demand the arduous cultivation of the will. Hope is not necessarily something people easily acquire-not a matter of mere wishful thinking when life becomes difficult, but a difficult moral obligation that must be assumed as a way to confront pain and despair.",

Against Epicurus and Lucretius, it affirms the reasonableness of fearing death. At the same time, it discusses and expresses sympathy for Bernard Williams’s view that death gives the meaning to life. Although it develops a position that differs from Williams’s in important respects, it argues that our deaths are necessary if we are to retain confidence in the value of our activities. Despite the reasonableness of fearing death, our confidence in our values depends far more on our confidence in the survival of other people after our deaths than it does on our confidence in our own survival. In fact, personal immortality would itself undermine such confidence. What is necessary to sustain our confidence in our values is that we should die and others should live.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "abstract": "In our daily life, we make any decision every moment. An appropriate and flexible decision is essential to acquire better and appropriate solutions against various and unpredictable problems and is also important to survive in the natural and social environment around us. When we make a decision, this decision is executed often based on some specific information. For example, when we visit a convenience store and try to get a drink, we may select a particular drink based on the information acquired before (e.g., information obtained from a talk with a friend or a TV advertisement) or based on our own preference or by chance. We often make a decision to select an item based on specific information acquired from a TV advertisement, for example, but we do not know whether we prefer it or not. This type of decision-making can be called memory-based decision-making. On the other hand, we make a decision to select an item based on our own preference (like or dislike) or experience (had high or low value). This type of decision-making can be called value-based decision-making. Further, we sometime select an item which we know nothing about our preference for it and its actual value or need to select one item among same items, or select an item by chance. This type of decision-making can be called free-choice decision-making, because we can use neither our memory, preference, nor experience to select an item. In the experimental situation, perceptual decision-making, decision-making in competitive condition, and decision-making in conflict conditions have also been used to examine neural mechanisms of decision-making. The prefrontal cortex has been shown to contribute to these decision-making processes significantly.",

      "title": "FACTORS RELATED TO TEACHER’S STRESS OF PRE-UNIVERSITY EDUCATION",
      "abstract": "Stress is a phenomen on that day by day is affecting the societies of all developed and developing countries.This is one of the most frequently used words since many people are facing every day with different loads, such in their jobs, in traffic, at home, and other places, and which loads sometimes become unmanageable. Constant and high intensity load and pressure give stress, which affects the quality of life and the results at work. So stressful situations, or stresors that give stress, are many, and we can find them in almost all areas where we live, but among the places, that stress is almost constant is the working place.Work can be a source of life satisfaction and self-esteem, but it can also be a source of great stress. Job stress depends on the fit of the worker to the position. Some people thrive in a high-stress, busy environment, whereas others feel overwhelmed. However, some situations are stressful for almost everybody, such as feeling as if your job is at risk or as if you can’t trust your bosses and colleagues. (Greenberg, M. 2016).Work stress exists when people perceive that they have difficulty in coping with the demands relating to work and that their sense of well-being is being threatened. (Kahatano, F. F. 2015). Occupational stress has negative effects on both the organisation and individuals employed by the organisation. In the organisation it can result in high levels of absenteeism, reduced productivity and compromised levels of patient care. (Gam, P. N., 2015) It is clear that there is stress on most of the employees in Kosovo, ann meanwhile it is indisputable, only differentiates the intensity of experienced stress. And from the stress situations could not escape even the teachers who face difficulties in their work. Teachers, in addition to the obligations they have with their students at school, sometimes have disagreement with colleagues, school principal, or other family problems that are not related to the teaching process but affect the teaching process. So the teachers, having a lot of problems and vicissitudes, feel the stress. The purpose of studying this topic is to find the factors that influence the cause of the teacher's stress. Empirical results showed that there are differences in the level of stress among elementary and lower secondary teachers and uppersecondary school teachers, whereas theuppersecondary school teachers have higher levels of stres, where the value of F=3.378 and p=0.036&lt;0.05.Based on empirical results, it can be concluded that uppersecondary school teachers experience more stress than primary and lower secondary teachers. Regarding the level of stress, to female and masculine teachers, the value of sig. for equal variances assumed, p=0.04&lt;0.05, whereas for the same variances not assumed, p=0.039&lt;0.05. Both values indicate that there are statistically significant differences between female and male gender teachers regarding the level of stress at work. The results showed that most of the factors related to the workplace are related to the teachers’ stress.",

In the Modernist canon, suicide is typically putting an end to one’s misery because there’s no reason not to do so, or because one is in any event a machine caused to do so by necessary causes and effects. Albert Camus’ Myth of Sisyphus is an essay on how to live without hope or suicide; his novel The Plague starts with an averted suicide and ends with limited hope – or a hope for limits. Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot begins and ends with the central duo’s wish, both times deferred, to hang themselves. Modernist responses to the question of meaning, and the attendant problem of suicide, include: persisting in hope or waiting despite the minimal probability of hope’s fulfillment (Franz Kafka, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ralph Ellison, Beckett); the epiphanies of the everyday, getting what it seemed you hoped for even without exactly having hoped for it (Virginia Woolf); affirmation of the repetitions, recurrences, and accidents of natural and human life, overcoming their sameness through an act of will (Camus).",

      "abstract": "Extract We all need a few basic things to get by and to raise our children in a way that’s loving, that’s consistent with our values, and that we can be proud of. Some of these things are concrete resources that we are all familiar with, that we spend our days trying to gather up and tend to: a comfortable, safe home; nourishing, healthy food; a wide and deep web of family and friends who we feel connected to. We all need people who will look out for us, those we could turn to in a time of need, and who we might call on if we needed help with child care, a ride to the doctor, a loan, some advice or support. It’s also good to have people who might, at times, come to us and ask us for some of the same things. We also need work that’s reliable and fairly compensated. The timing of this work needs to be stable enough so that we can be predictably available to our partners and our children. Some basic needs are less tangible. We need to feel safe, that most of the time we are free of threat and danger, and that we live in communities in which we feel respected and valued and in which we are trusted and can trust others. We need to be able to sleep at night. Safety means being free of the fear of violence, mistreatment, or discrimination based on one’s race, gender, or sexuality. Safety is also connected to a sense that the fundamental arrangements of our social lives, the laws and practices that rule and guide our collective life, are fair and just and that the police and various public systems are committed to protecting and serving everyone effectively and equally. Children need schools that are safe and that, at minimum, teach them basic skills and keep them moving forward toward productive adulthoods. The list could go on, and each of our lists might differ as a function of who we are, the social groups in which we claim membership, and the multiple sources of identity we hold. But we are guessing that there would probably be a good deal of agreement among these lists.",

      "title": "What Anyone Can Do: How Surrounding Yourself with the Right People Will Drive Change, Opportunity, and Personal Growth",
      "abstract": "Most of us don’t seek advice or reach out to others for help very easily. In part, it’s because we’re conditioned to see life as an individual endeavor rather than a team sport. Or because we believe that asking for help makes us look weak or incapable. We regard self-help as by-yourself-help. News flash: no one in the history of the world has ever achieved any level of happiness or success totally by themselves. 　\nIn his 1976 book The Long Run Solution, Joe Henderson suggested that becoming truly accomplished at running (or at anything) doesn’t typically require us to perform superhuman feats. In fact, success is frequently realized by those who simply do the things anyone can do that most of us never will. \nIn What Anyone Can Do, with the help of Leo Bottary’s Year of the Peer podcasts guests (and playful illustrations by Ryan Foland), you’ll discover that if you surround yourself with the right people, you’ll do the things anyone can do far more often. And when you do that, you and the people around you will realize more of what you want out of business and life. It’s that simple.\nThe Power of Peers (2016) made a strong case for how and why formal peer groups are so effective. This book steps outside the formal peer group arena to examine all the important relationships we have in our lives (parents, teachers, spouses, mentors, children, mentees, etc.) and provides a practical approach and specific framework for harnessing their power for your benefit (and theirs). It’s what anyone can do. You’re anyone, right?",

This thesis refers to the causes and the effects of alienation on the main characters in those nine stories. To find out the causes and the results of the alienation of the main characters, the thesis writer analyzes the central characters' attitudes and their problems which are considered as the causes of the alienation. Then, she discusses what happens to them as a result of their isolated condition. The causes of the main characters' alienation are various: war, abnormal behavior, dissapointment, betrayal, the death of the parents, and the feeling of being ignored. These experiences have different effects on the main characters. Those who can get help at handling their problems can survive and come out from the alienated world but those who cannot get help from others will end in loneliness, frustration, death, and self alienation. The thesis writer sees alienation as a means of the development of the human personality for those who are successfull in overcoming it. But those who fail to overcome it, will not be able to face reality and continue to be kept out from their society. In some cases, the result is death.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease or AD is characterised by neurofibrillary knots, or tangles, and beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Nerve cells waste away and wither and eventually decay and die. AD is a state of atrophy, degeneration, and negation. It is about not thinking right, about not being able to think straight, and not being able to remember. In Heidegger's terms we could think of this as unthinking—or unthought: nots as well as knots. As a site of resistance this essay is highly speculative, an exploration of nonfiction as an experiment with experience, in particular an experiment in writing the father, my father: ‘Visiting Not Dad’. What I am presenting here is a trying out (or essaying) of something … something indistinct, something belonging more to shadows, half-light, the in-betweens, which takes us away from the deductive logic and dogmatism of my father's creationist beliefs opting instead to celebrate empathy and pathos, with a willingness to explore human fallibility, and unsettledness. Through a close-up experience of Alzheimer's disease, and the poetics of jottings and annotations, I ask: is there a possible link between what we know and observe about AD and the necrotising and knotting of the brain, and the search for something indeterminate, poetic, unthought?",

First, people must witness firsthand the splintering of their own selves during the fragmentation stage. In the second or provisionality stage, they must desperately struggle at assembling new, unified selves to replace the former ones that split apart. If this challenge is not enough, they must then somehow summon the courage and conviction to subject their newly unified selves to the \"test of experience\" during the praxis stage. Should their newly unified selves withstand this test, then people must patiently await the social repercussions that they hope will follow in wake of their feat in order to generate the psychological momentum needed for them to embrace fully their new unified selves during the consolidation stage. Finally, during the social segregation stage, people must invariably gravitate toward groups in which they will be most comfortable and away from groups in which they will be least comfortable expressing their new selves. Thus, once started, dramatic self-change may never be completed.",

People living in war inflicted countries and refugee camps experience chronic stress and uncertainty and must learn to adapt. Family members experience numerous other stressful situations together, including divorce, the loss of a home or job, and illness. When several individuals experience a stressful situation together and a stressor is appraised and active upon as “our problem and our responsibility,” it is referred to as communal coping.",

Rather than offering ourselves the same sympathy and support we would give to a loved one, we tend to criticize ourselves (“What’s the matter with you!”), we hide from others or ourselves in shame (“I’m worthless”), and we get stuck in our heads trying to make sense of what happened to us (“Why me?”). And when very bad things happen, we attack ourselves from two directions saying, for example, “I’m bad because I was abused” and “I was abused because I’m bad.” If we do not numb ourselves through dissociation, we may try drugs, alcohol, or self-injury. And no matter how much we wish to get out of our heads and get on with our lives, we find ourselves locked in a struggle with intrusive memories, nightmares, and flashbacks. Such reactions make our suffering persist and even amplify it, but they’re not our fault. They’re how we’re wired (Gilbert, 2009a). When we feel threatened by external danger, our survival often depends on our capacity to fight, flee, or freeze. But when we’re threatened internally by intense emotions such as dread or shame, the fight–flight–freeze response turns into an unholy trinity of self-criticism, self-isolation, and self-absorption. Fortunately, we also have a hardwired capacity to respond to our own",

Until you start to feel at home in your new environment, you must negotiate feelings of discomfort. Mindfulness draws attention to your experience of transition, enabling you to cultivate an embodied presence, receptivity, and awareness of whatever arises in yourself and your surroundings, without judging or rejecting your experience. All too often, when we feel uncomfortable or unsettled, we immediately want to alleviate our feelings of discomfort by seeking comfort or distraction. When we do this, we rob ourselves of the opportunity to grow and develop in new ways. This book shows how attending to change, ambiguity, and discomfort can help you manage transitions that you will inevitably face in your life. You will learn how to be mindful of your breath, body, feelings, emotions, and thoughts, as well as how you might cultivate kindness, compassion, joy, and spaciousness in your life and relationships with others. By developing the core ability to attend to what you do, what you think, and what you say, you can enhance your own well-being as well as your relationships with others.",

With leisure I anticipate in this context the time that we don't spend working within payed labour. Leisure interests, association commitments, engagements and so forth are activities that compete for our time. It can sometimes be pure recovery but sometimes commitments that increase stress. If room for regeneration is poor or nonexistent there is an increased risk for among other things, stress related troubles. Factors that are decisive for how our recovery and our time of leisure will look, exists on an individual level, in our psychosocial and on a communal level. Today's public health politics focus on decision which are factors in the organization of society and humans living concurrences and living habits that has an impact on good health or poor health. We have different frames to operate in, different resources and we meet and react differently to all kinds of stress factors. According to Aaron Antonovskys, individuals have different levels of resistance. Some remain healthy and manage themselves well, in spite of great demands which have to do with how we handle our obstacles and our ability to give our way of life continuity (SOC, sense of coherence). The focus on this work is on the recovery and leisure of women, i.e the experience and management of the individual recovery abilities during the leisure time. The purpose with the assignment has been to clarify how (dual) working women experience and manage their recovery opportunities.

Hope is about connecting, relating, being part of a healthy matrix and the consequent sense of agency that can come from this. This talk explores the particular quality of disconnectedness in our more disturbed patients where hope and despair move in cycles without any sense of a functioning centre that can keep hold of the pieces and understand how they fit together. Parallels are drawn between our patients' internal worlds and the external world in which we are located and work. Developing a sense of personal agency within a meaningful social matrix in a therapeutic community is contrasted to the state where the organization is always on the edge of unpredictable catastrophe and patients remain in a condition of despairing helplessness.",

As schools and colleges empty, groups of young people crowd the pavement, achieving what seems like an impossible range of simultaneous activities—eating, drinking, texting, and talking at top volume to each other. Adolescence is a time of change, discovery, and uncertainty. Adolescent rebellion has moved on since then. Or has it? In the 1960s, parents tut-tutted about their daughters' miniskirt or their sons' long hair. In the early years of the twenty-first century, teenagers \"negotiate\" (or not) tattoos and piercings, and young women reveal an increasing amount of leg, midriff, and cleavage. Little has changed. Parents of adolescents brace themselves as the impact of hormones and a quest for greater independence kick in. And sometimes adolescent anger and moroseness turn into repeated acts of delinquency or—sometimes fatal—violence towards self and/or others.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Simple acts of kindness that are performed sincerely and with evident good will can also, paradoxically, be perceived as deeply insulting by the people we succeed in benefiting. When we are moved to help someone out of genuine concern for her, when we have no intention to humiliate or embarrass her and when we succeed at benefiting her, how can our generosity be disparaging or demeaning to her? Yet, when the tables are turned, we sometimes find ourselves brusquely refusing assistance from others or accepting it only grudgingly while trying to show that we do not need their charity. People with disabilities often find ourselves in situations of this sort, where we bristle at others who rush to open doors for us, for instance, while our kindhearted benefactors are surprised and hurt by the cold reception they receive for their efforts. My aim is to explain some of the ways in which well-intentioned and effective beneficence can be offensive, with special emphasis on cases in which someone provides assistance to a disabled person.",

      "abstract": "Ours or the Other Place Anna Monardo NewYork is like a guy who doesn't like you as much as you Uke him. You know it's time to let this crush go. It's been too long with no phone calls, nothing. And stiU, you arrange your days and evenings so you'U be there for his caU if it ever comes. The phone rings differendy when it's him. It's a better ring. One day, you admit to yourself that this romance lives nowhere but in your own head. You admit to the hard work of keeping it aUve. You ask yourself, finaUy, Why am I doing this? Because there was that one heightened bit of time when he made you feel like someone grander than yourself, some better version ofyourself— freer, happier, funnier, smarter, more beautiful, wiser, more worldly, kinder, braver. Only a passing glance can have this intensity, this jumped-up pulse. Afterward, you are addicted—not to him, but to the enhanced vision of yourself. It's Uke crack, a fast and soUd addiction. You need this person so you can feel that way again. Nothing matters but to feel that way again.Your whole being is in need of this person.Your bones feel the need for him and the absence of him. NewYork is like that. It was 1977 and I was twenty-one years old. I thanked God when I arrived in NewYork. I had flown just one hour from Pittsburgh, but I was as grateful as an immigrant, as relieved as a refugee who has finaUy escaped. I don't mean to equate the enormity of exüe with the comparative ease of my departure from suburbia, but I can't Ue about this: landing in NewYork felt as lucky to me and as monumental as it must have felt for anyone who ever saüed into EIUs Island. In leaving my famüy's home, I was an anarchist. 8 Fourth Genre Our women had never Uved in this place I was going to. For my ItaUan grandmothers, my mother, my aunts, a Ufe between the home of the father and the home of the husband had never existed. But now it did exist. At last, I was in the right place. The city was completely new to me but felt completely known. I can put it no other way but to say that I was happy in my skin. A few years later, working a book-publishingjob, I glanced through the glass waU ofan office and got a gUmpse, two rooms down, of a man—taU and large, dark-haired, in a heavy overcoat. I did a double take. He was stunning in a roughed-up sort of way I had never known I was attracted to. But now I was. He startled me. Who is that? I'd never seen him before but I felt that premonition offamiliarity, the beginning ofloyalty. Ijust knew that this man and I would have some kind of business together. (EventuaUy, of course, we did. It was with him, one of my first close friends in the city, that I learned about the particular sexiness of talking late into the night, in the booth of a bar or at the tiny table ofa coffee house, working your way toward the possibüity of lovemaking. Then veering right past it, just so you can keep on talking. Here's the magic trick: Ifyou keep talking past sex, the possibüity ofit stays there between you, around you, Uke the aroma ofa meal that is almost ready to be served, but not quite. Our times together were deUcious because we never did become lovers, which was of course what I'd had in mind the first time I saw him through the glass and my breath caught.) Flying into New York in September of '77 I looked through the double-paned window of the USAir jet, down into a misty Friday morning, and I felt that same astonishing tug. I had just left my famüy and my coUege boyfriend, who, the day before, had sent me roses, and my mother, in a last...",

Unlike today's haphazard dating customs, The Rules recognizes certain facts of life. That men know what they want. That a man is either attracted to you--or not! That men want a challenge, not an instant or easy victory. When you follow these commonsense guidelines, you treat yourself with respect and dignity--and demand that men do likewise. Although they sound old-fashioned (Don't see him more than once or twice a week), they encourage you to lead a full, satisfying, busy life--outside of romance. Although they seem tough (Don't talk to a man first), they will teach you how to accept occasional defeat and move on. And although they require discipline (No more than casual kissing on the first date), they will bring out the best in you and in the men you date. The goal? Marriage, in the shortest time possible, to a man you love, who loves you even more than you love him.",

Turbulences come up which we call 'crisis'. One of them is the so called 'middle life crisis': both sexes undergo it between their thirties and their fourties--some people slightly before, some other people later on. Youth is passing by and Man feels sorry for that. The passing by of Time leaves tremendous scars, at first in the biological realm, in the psychologic one afterwards. This is how Man Knows he has reached the top of the mountain, hence that the descent is about to take place. Parents in the old age, parents who die--these factors do contribute to the sensation of one becoming old. Clearer and clearer each time, Man feels he will be the next one who is bound to get old and die. Middle life crisis has Man recognizing that some of his most praised dreams are never to come true. This means accepting that life will be over soon enough. In case Man didn't betray his own self too much, it is still time for him to start and capitalize his former experiences thus increasing both his creativity and insight.",

      "abstract": "Positional power surrounds us. Parents, supervisors, elected officials, siblings, reporters . . . they all have power to make choices for us, and sometimes about us. Yet it is our personal power that provides our quality of life. Personal power is knowing our strength and using it to bal­ance and rebalance our thoughts and behaviors. We know we will fail. We know we will become entangled in difficult situa­tions. We know we will lose sight of our best selves at times. Yet our power is sustained by the belief that we will regain our footing. We will overcome our challenges. We will persevere and regain our ultimate vibrancy. Those with personal power display their confidence and com­petence, but not at another’s expense. They know their strength and use it to continually strive for interpersonal satisfaction, con­nection, and meaning. What makes our personal power strong? It is the influence generated and exuded. This version of personal power is not necessarily influence over others; rather, it inspires others in ways that make them want to be better, do better. Think of the people you have met, perhaps even strangers who appear powerful. They seem comfortable in their own skin, awake to all that is around them. Our personal power is “our spiritual fingerprint”. It is magnificent in its subtlety and stability. When we acknowledge and use our personal power to its best intention, we see and feel its influence on us. Positional power ranks us according to our positions in the social, familial, administrative, or business- related milieu of our lives. The influence of positional power can vary greatly, and the extent to which people submit to positional power varies greatly. We forfeit an important part of ourselves when we sublimate per­sonal power in favor of our own or another’s positional power. Have you noticed that some of the most influential teachers in schools may be those who are powerfully quiet and unassuming? Have you noticed that students can sometimes sense the power of a classmate who otherwise is not an obvious leader?",

The many historical, economic and racial strands joining to form this country which is at once something more than a state, something less than a nation, are intricate and interconnected. In addition, South Africa is a difficult subject to write about with detachment. It generally evokes passionate attachment or inveterate antipathy even though its problems are neither as simple nor as soluable as both its critics and its proponents maintain. Most importantly, the racial groups which are involved in the entire complex of conflicting attitudes and ideologies are all guilty to a certain extent of living in a pseudo environment; an environment or role into which each has cast itself. There is hence a definite divorce between dream and reality, self image and real image, and this more than any other single factor militates against any comprehensive, objective and equitable solution to the continuing social and psychological problems of South Africa. The African South African tends to view the situation with either leaden resignation or extremely wishful thinking. The Asian and Colored communities constantly emphasize non-political solutions with a detached sort of apathy, while the white South African takes a kind of ethnocentric pride in ignoring existing evidence and shows an intense preoccupation with living in a world of myth and stereotype.",

This chapter explores the everyday expression of homesickness and longing and the work people in Illorsuit (pseudonym) put into balance these between inadequacy and excessiveness. Some people may express their longing for a visit from a friend; others –students in the city– may return to the village for unannounced visits citing homesickness. Young hunters may also occasionally return early from hunting trips owing to feelings of longing for their wives or children. Some people long for particular places in the landscape, particular seasons enjoyed in those places, or certain foods found or shared only in certain places or seasons. However, longing and homesickness can also become excessive and uncontrollable. An excessively homesick person's spirit may wrestle itself lose from the body and journey to the place or people that is longed for; and a person suffering uncontrollable longing may experience physical ailments such as headaches or nosebleeds. Expressions of longing and homesickness speak as much about relatedness as they do about loneliness, and are in this way central to the way people in Illorsuit re-invoke their belonging across great distance or remove.",

Many if not most individuals feel a deep sense of despair, made more intense by the loneliness that is part of their lives. The power differentials between those who receive services and those who provide services often intensify this sense of despair and loneliness. It is in that relationship between the powerful and the powerless that loneliness and despair start to build, because there is no bridge between the people who serve and those being served. Those of us who provide services and supports to people in need have been taught to be objective and factual, but facts are only part of the story, the roadway so to speak. The foundations of the bridges between people are found in the emotional connections, the places where the stories of their lives take shape. In order to gain the whole story we must listen to the feelings, where the thematic images behind the words present the story of this person’s life.",

Our answers to these philosophical or conceptual questions may in part depend on our beliefs about certain features of human motivation, particularly how we would answer such questions as the following: Are all desires ultimately for one's own good or happiness, or do we at least sometimes want the happiness of other people for their own sake, independently of any positive effect of their well-being on ourselves? Would we ever act to promote the welfare of others, or pursue any aim at all, unless we believed we would enjoy the activity or its results, or at least thought that the habit would somehow be for our own benefit in the long run? That these questions are not as simple as one might think is evident in the writings of the major British moralists, the relation between morality and interest being one of their main concerns. Francis Hutcheson (1694-1746) I wish to thank Professors W. K. Frankena, Henning Jensen, and D. D. Raphael for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper. I am particularly grateful also to Professor David Fate Norton for his detailed suggestions and critical remarks. [~'61] 26z HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY was for the latter part of his career Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University, a leading member of the moral-sense school, and an important philosopher whose views were widely discussed. John Clarke (16871734 ), Master of the Grammar School in Hull and Gloucester, was a lesser figure among the British moralists and not nearly so well known. Though he was not a man of as many parts as Hutcheson or Hume, undoubtedly his professional position had a good deal to do with his comparative obscurity, for, as he stated himself, \"the very name of a country school-master is enough to prejudice abundance of people against any thing, such a one can say, upon so abstruse a subject, that lies so much too out of the way of his province.\"' In fact, Clarke was a very able philosopher, an intelligent and witty writer, a devastating critic, and perhaps the most sophisticated proponent of hedonism in his time. Indeed, one cannot find anywhere in the literature a philosophical defense of psychological hedonism more articulate and plausible than his. Both Hutcheson and Clarke were influenced by Locke; ~ but Clarke's psychology and ethics--hedonism and theological utilitarianism -were much closer to Locke's, Clarke expressed his own doctrines in three critical works directed at several of his contemporaries: An Examination of the Notion of Moral Good and Evil (1725) is a refutation of William Wollaston's theory; The Foundation of Morality in Theory and Practice (n.d., but sometime between 1726 and 1728 ), his major work, is an answer to Samuel Clarke and Hutcheson; finally, An Examination of what has been advanced relating to Moral Obligation (173o) is another attack upon Samuel Clarke and his followers. He had hoped to publish a more comprehensive book on ethics, to be titled A Treatise upon Morality,~ but this projected work unfortunately never appeared. The philosophical debate between Hutcheson and John Clarke is worth the attention of anyone interested in the problems of human motivation and ' An Examination of what has been advanced relating to Moral Obhgation, in a late pamphlet, entitled, \"A Defence of the Answer to the Remarks upon Dr. Clarke's Exposition of the Church-Catechism\" (London, 173o), p. 5.

      "abstract": "The concept of prosperity is often associated with economic growth and the success of a product on the market, neglecting or downplaying the impact on the environment and people according to a model that has long been considered unsustainable. What is your definition of prosperity and what do you think are the tools and approaches to develop it? I’ve not considered the term prosperity before the conference so I can’t say I have an interpretation for myself. The term I use is cohabitation, the idea of living together well. Some qualify this further with the word “thriving”, which I believe is a good addition, but the term is rich enough on its own. It takes more than compatibility or fair exchange to live together, to dwell in place among differences and similarities. It requires kinship and accepting entanglements to use posthumanist language. For me, it’s important that cohabitation is collective or at least requires others and some form of collective participation. It is also active in that to live with others requires being there together, creating shared places, and lastly it is temporal or durational–the length of time together defines in part the cohabitation. To prosper and to thrive can be seen as an individual matter, separate from place, even exclusively about the interiority of the mind or self. I don’t mean that as a critique but more as a comparison to highlight what cohabitation as a term brings. In terms of approach, I see cohabitation as the goal for designing or what I call designing-with to invoke a more-than-human context for designing. In other words, it can be a measure for the success of what and how well we design. If a thing is designed, how does it contribute to living well together throughout its life and after, well past human use (which we then call “waste”). Further, we can ask how the thing designed existed in the world but also what it took to create a thing and its effects on cohabitation. I want to be careful about methods, so we don’t view emerging techniques as fixed and immediately teachable. This is a necessary area of design research that is difficult given the fullness of the challenge to design from a decentered position and as a relational subject (as required by designing-with or posthumanist understandings of design). Nevertheless, there are compelling theoretical starting points that we have explored (along with other design researchers) such as noticing (Tsing 2015), translations (Latour 1999), landscape ethnography (Watts 2019), diffraction (Barad 2014; Haraway 1994), and learning to be affected (Lorimer 2015). The work is to move these methods from the analytical to generative considerations of design: the actions and commitments required of designers. I’ve conceptualized this as repertoires, to signal a more-than-human inflection on methods based on attunement and embodied actions. I have with others explored these in our practices in designing-with plants, pollination ecologies, textiles, networked devices, mycelium, and bioplastics . These are early explorations and as I said in the end of my keynote, I caution against rushing to instrumentalize what we know now into practice. This caution is inspired by Isabelle Stengers’ ideas of cosmopolitics (Stengers 2005) and slow science (Stengers 2018) that ask us to fully accept the challenges to know and further not to resolve differences so easily, especially in the context of neo-liberal pursuits. Rather to take the time (it will take time if done properly) and keep differences of knowing intact. The concept of ‘designing-with’ that you propose challenges the tradition of anthropocentric design. What was the main motivation that led you to develop this more relational and inclusive approach? What are the limits of traditional design and how can ‘designing-with’ overcome them? My motivation was to engage the community that I was doing much of my research in, namely human-computer interaction (HCI). On a high level, HCI is a fascinating enterprise to understand the relationship between humans and computers. Its starting points were between technical and human cognition but over time evolved to include social, philosophical, and political questions about human-technology relations. This has led to fascinating and constructive tensions in HCI between those who pursue a science of technology and generalizable models of users and those who focus on power in the relationships as a matter of race, gender, ethnicity or decoloniality, as examples. What fascinates me in these discussions of who we are putting at the center of our research or what is the appropriate technology, or which technological needs are addressed, is the relations between these questions and perspectives. How these concerns are connected, not only reveals what brings them together but what governs them or shapes them. What is “appropriate” for whom; whose “needs” are we concerned with; and which beings and matter are included in the question of “who”? In HCI, these relations are governed by human-centeredness. What is not said does not need to be said since we can readily assume we are talking about humans. Human-centered design or user-centered design is an instrumentalized or practical implementation of human exceptionalism. In design, and this instrumentalization goes well beyond HCI to include design and its many variants, the humanist notion of humans as the privileged actors in the world is how we conceive of (and educate) designers; and human concerns are privileged over others in constructs of users and consumers. In professional design or the corporate world of design, late-capitalism and consumerism merge tightly with human-centered design to form the governing force of what is design, its values, and its aims. It’s worth noting that Rosi Braidotti makes clear that despite the marketing rhetoric, corporate bodies and the global economy have long gotten over the exceptionalism of humans, flattening all life to be various sources of extraction whether human biology, labour across species, agriculture, or mining (Braidotti 2013). My earlier research was timid given all this but set the tone. It questioned the concepts of user and designer, i.e., who designs and what do we mean by use (and for whom)? I later adopted a counterfactual strategy of inverting the privilege of humans over technology inherent in most HCI and design to decenter designers and users to ask what it means to be a thing? This question cannot be answered but it revealed other approaches: how things can be designed to ask that question that points toward a decentered form of designing; and how the notion of things is “leaky” to cite Donna Haraway (Haraway 1985) or more vividly described by Nancy Tuana as having a “viscous porosity” (Tuana 2008). Whatever is designed is not discrete but becomes entangled, not in the sense of the social conditions of things, that is well researched, but in feminist and cyber-feminist realizations that reveal posthumanist and new materialist relations. I would trace these entanglements as best I could to of course find that humans are entangled with nonhuman actors and forces . This revealed to me the problematic of designing with a relational ontology, in which humans and nonhumans (myself, the things we designed, and other things, and the world) co-mingle, shaping each other into meanings and actions. And that a relational ontology made effects and meaning dynamic, changing or in a constant state of becoming to use another posthumanist term. It is from this point in my design research and writing of Things We Could Design (Wakkary 2021) the ideas of designing-with, much of what we have been discussing here, came to be articulated. Of course, there were others in my field (HCI) that were also exploring these concerns (Forlano 2017; Light, Powell, and Shklovski 2017). I don’t have the space here to discuss the limits of traditional design, but I can comment on how designing-with can inform directions. I will say that I increasingly came to see human-centered design as defuturing, to borrow Tony Fry’s term (Fry 1999), in that it was obscuring and precluding other more expansive possibilities for designing. Designing-with can be seen in this light. Designing-with can contribute to change in a variety of ways and along a continuum. At one end it asks for a radical change since the governing assumptions are very different than status quo and where our attention should be is also radically different. I tried to outline some starting concepts in Things We Could Design that we might get to in more detail later. It is in this sense aspirational but with some conceptual tools for making change. While radical change may be required, I want to be clear that this does not put all the efforts within human-centered design in opposition. For example, a common point of departure in efforts related to decoloniality, race, or gender in design and more-than-human is a critique of the modernist position of oppression, the privileging of white European male as the idealized and universalized human that determines all others to be less-than or “inhuman” as Kathryn Yusoff refers to the historically oppressed of European colonization (Yusoff 2018). This understanding of the historical and ongoing work necessary when invoking the notion of humans is part of my understanding and others in more-than-human concerns. Building on feminist thinkers and indigenous ways of knowing grounded in interdependencies, this position is expanded upon, made more generous to include other species but also seeing technologies in cyber-feminist terms and so a part of more-than-humans. The shared needs and urgencies in this relational and expansive sense are seen to be matters of concern of designing. In the end, more-than-human is inclusive of humans with all the inherent power relations and new ones as well. To move to the other end of the continuum, the most minimal change, is to affect a realization of the human exceptionalist enterprise of traditional design. And framing practice this way may instill a degree of humility or caution that leads to limiting some actions and engaging the most general level of ethics–just because we can doesn’t mean we should. Whereas concepts like more-than-human biographies that speak to the fullness of the life of things we make can be made part of current design practices, extending sustainability efforts. Lastly, designing-with has pedagogical value. It and other approaches can be integrated into design education as change is typically generational. Again, there are varying degrees of integration but one emphasis I would make is to shift the focus of the designer from an individual autonomous actor to a collective more-than-human assemblages, a form of infrastructuring (Ehn 2008) as it’s called in participatory design (and what I call constituency). This translates to ongoing collective structures to support designing before designing occurs but inclusive of more-than-humans. In your work you talk about ‘posthuman subjectivity’. Can you explain how this idea redefines the role and responsibility of the designer? How does the creative and decision-making process of a designer who adopts this perspective change? I think this is the central challenge. How we move past human subjectivity as cultivated by human exceptionalism from the enlightenment to modernism. A form of subjectivity that fosters the idea of the autonomous self. A sense of self that creates separation between us and the world around us. A self that is individual and leads to the pursuit of mastery and control. In many respects that is the humanist or modern subjectivity we reproduce in and ask of designers. By contrast, a posthuman subjectivity is not conceptualized as autonomous but relational or interdependent with the world. To the point that mastery and control are not available but also not desirable. Rather the pursuit is humble and seeks kinship and shares agency with other matters and beings. In philosophical terms it is a subjectivity that is decentered and relational, meaning we are one of many actors working in relation to each other in shaping and cohabiting the world and achieving subjectivity through our interdependencies in the world. And further, subjectivity is an ongoing process, even pluralistic, that is both dynamic and requires attentiveness in its constant formation and reformation (Foucault 2005). In the most general terms, designing as a posthuman subject requires a shift toward listening and working alongside. Metaphorically, it is to embody a position of horizontality to increase contact points with others and sense degrees of difference across the body as opposed to verticality that privileges vision from a single viewpoint above and minimizes points of contact. To be horizontal to work alongside is to embrace the relationality (and humility) of the subject, how as a designer one responds and changes in relation to the situation we are embodied within and with those we cohabit. The metaphoric framing of this points to the need for exploration to meet what is quite a challenge to reorient and re-embody from human to posthuman subjectivities. Having said that, we discussed earlier methods or repertoires which are there to support the posthuman subjectivity in designing. The concept of ‘more-than-human worlds’ implies a vision of design that takes into account non-human agents. What do you think are the main challenges in integrating this perspective into design practice? How can we translate these concepts into concrete tools for designers working in industrial or technological contexts, where a functionalist approach often prevails? I prefer to turn the question upside down. Since the prevailing functionalist approach will exhaust and destroy the earth’s current habitat, especially the critical zone (the biomes just above and below the surface of the earth we cohabit), the question is what concepts and tools can support radical change in how we design? The point is that privileging functionality, efficiency, and commerce is not a viable choice going forward. Equally important and relevant, is that designing in more-than-human worlds is also not a choice. Regardless of what approach one takes, one is always designing in more-than-human worlds. Worlds that contest much of what we do but also suffer great harm through the way we currently design. On the one hand the challenge is great in that the change required is significant and complex. Of course, human-centered design similarly called for radical change from technocentric practices of the 1960s and took some thirty years or more to become a firmly established practice. Creative practices like in textiles for centuries were guild practice for elite classes. It was not until the early 20th century that creative practices were more broadly practiced for wider, less economically privileged classes. In this sense, the challenge is eased when seen as a generational change of integrating more-than-human thinking into design practices. Of course, the patience for change is challenged by the urgencies of our climate, biodiversity, and injustice crises. Over time you have talked about concepts such as ‘speaking subject’, ‘biography’ and ‘constituency’ in design. Can you elaborate on how these elements redefine the relationships between designed objects and their users (human and otherwise)? How do these concepts help us see objects not just as tools, but as subjects with which we enter into a relationship? I’m happy to go over these concepts in turn. They also help to address your previous question in more detail. But first I would like to address the last part of your question. I see things or objects, as you refer to them, as lively, meaning they can have agentic effects independent of us, and are dynamic. This liveliness contests the narrow definition of tools, things in stasis but more importantly, as you suggest, we are in dialogue, in an active relationship with things. This is readily obvious with living matter and species (think viruses and animals) but ideas like Haraway’s cyborg or Ihde’s co-shaping includes technologies (Haraway 1985; Ihde 1990). Things and us are co-constituted, we create meaning and actions in relation to each other. We form in relation to each other. I use the example of mountaineering to illustrate this point in Things We Could Design. Technological clothing shapes humans into mountain climbers and extends to shape mountains into climbable terrain. Of course, the challenge is to design to c-shape in ways that aspire to cohabitation rather than human mastery. This shared agency, as commonly referred to in posthumanism, adds to what I referred earlier to the need for designers to listen and work alongside. I distill this into the idea of participation. The need to accept and invite the participation of nonhumans in designing, whether its matter as materials, technologies, or other living beings. This idea of participation is what each of the concepts you asked me to elaborate on are in response to. For example, the speaking subject is about our human role in fostering nonhuman participation; biographies speak to the participation of things in their meaning and effects on the world; and constituencies are about the gathering of humans and nonhumans to participate in the infrastructuring or structures by which we design before designing. To elaborate, let me begin with the constituency. It refers to a gathering of humans and nonhumans from which designers of things come together to go on to design things. Constituencies are an ongoing concern that are continually configured and reconfigured. A kitchen is a good analogy for a constituency. It is where humans are gathered with nonhumans like food ingredients, cooking utensils, pots and pans, ovens, stoves, and recipes. Cultural and political commitments are made such as veganism, non-GMO, halal, ethnicity, history, and place. This metaphor easily extends to the design studio or other forms of collective structures for designing. Relatedly, the speaking subject describes the unique role of the human designer in amongst the more-than-human constituency that designs. The speaking subject is accountable for speaking on behalf of, maintaining, caring for, and refining the gathering of humans and nonhumans. There is an inherent ethical dimension to the speaking subject, the ongoing need to address the challenges of representing, caring with, and seeking participation from more-than-human others in ways that do not misrepresent or instrumentalize. For example, Latour talks about a “parliament of things” in which we politically represent humans and nonhumans to other humans (Latour 1993). This inspired the Embassy of the North Sea in the Hague, that seeks to give inhabitants of the North Sea across all species political representation. In this representation of others, the speaking subject acknowledges the inherent politics and inequalities in assuming such a role. It is important to say that it is impossible to fairly represent and maintain relations with all in a constituency and to speak on behalf others that cannot be fully known or seen. This underscores the need for accountability within the unresolvable ambivalence of the role. Hence, the speaking subject relies on repertoires that we discussed earlier to gather and engage more-than-humans to participate more fully and to make explicit actions to be held accountable. More-than-human biography is the human and nonhuman life force (agencies) that come together to design or form a thing. It signals that shared agencies are dynamic and continually inscribe themselves into the world through their lifetime. A more-than-human biography operates across human and nonhuman temporalities that can challenge our human-scale of time. The concept argues that the value of a thing can be assessed by its more-than-human biography that directly relates to cohabitation, namely its consequences beyond human use and what it leaves behind. For example, the Bag with handle of weldable plastic material or more commonly, the plastic bag, patented in 1965 by the industrial designer Sten Gustaf Thulin and the company Celloplast, became a global product of convenience but also one of ongoing colossal waste and toxicity, environmental injustices, and belated legislations to curb its use. All this together, form the shared biography of the plastic bag, Thulin, and Celloplast. We may be closing in on the end of the plastic bag biography—yet its last chapter has the resiliency to last for up to 1,000 years that result in microplastics that do not decompose. In my own research, an example is a project to explore relational technologies with local pollination ecologies of solo bees. It aims to situate the materials and technological choices within the specific locale in terms of ecological cohabitation. Part of that is designing the technological forms in terms of their biography, where do the materials come from to design-with, how do they exist within the ecologies, and how do they end, in terms of decomposition and removal, but also along the different ecological timelines such as long enough for the nesting cycle of mason bees or the foraging season after which parts decompose on site. How does the design and the narrative around objects change when we consider them as having a biography or as part of a wider constellation of agents? This is something we have been exploring recently. In part, the notion of more-than-human biographies like the example of the plastic bag enlists narrative to frame a thing anew. This reveals the necessity to discuss and engage things differently. For example, I’ve explored how biographies shift the focus of designing from creating something new to creating how something will end–what it will leave behind. I’ve written about this theoretically in how the endings of things construct futures. I’ve also encouraged students to design for the end of the thing they are making. And we’ve explored this in our design research. In any designed thing there are a plurality of endings we might consider: how will the thing or its parts disassemble, fragment, decompose, or become irreducible matter? The narrative framing makes explicit more-than-human temporalities that are not governed by human use or values and exist across different scales. In the pollination ecology project, I mentioned earlier there are different endings to consider along different temporal cycles of the ecology and its locale–which happens to be my backyard. Part of what we are designing allows for cavity nesting of the different solo bees in our area. The nesting cycles vary widely so this part is designed for year–round stability. While another part is made of bioplastics that house electronics that are removed in the Fall as they monitor foraging. The bioplastic housing begins to decompose late summer and is left in place to fall apart and decay through to late Fall. Here, we also consider the beginning of the biography. The bioplastic is mostly composed of ground spruce cones collected nearby and so as decaying matter it is not new to the site or ecology. The research surfaces the relations and effects that occur over different timelines that affect how what we design cohabits within the ecology. Much of the focus is in determining what we don’t know or cannot know and finding the humble path through.",

A holiday that suits them may allow you to relax as well, relieve tensions, and allow you to enjoy what may not have been your first choice of destination. Perhaps the most important person to consider is your partner, who may also have strong views on the sort of break he or she needs. It may be helpful to draw up lists of what you each would like on your holiday and where you each would like to go, but be prepared to compromise if necessary. For example, your partner may feel that a break from cooking is paramount while you may prefer being chef de cuisine on holiday.\n\nChildren change everything.

      "title": "On Survival and Education: An Academic’s Perspective on Disability",
      "abstract": "When illness and disability strike, it can seem as though one’s very being is threatened. We tend to consider illness a temporary situation, a phase, a phase that will be done with, sooner or later, and the victim of the attack will be rectified, and will survive it. But in chronic illness, there is a gap, a missing piece that cannot be found, despite all attempts. This is not necessarily a loss, as to claim that there is a loss falls into dangerous territory of positing a once complete or whole body and/or self. The losses are not due to a changing body, but rather discriminatory disablement by society’s understandings of disability. When bodies begin to falter, painful experiences of embodiment and how we experience the world begin to emerge. But to survive is to live through, live with, or live without something. To survive is to also be resilient to any losses. To be a survivor is to have been on the threshold of non-surviving, to have considered giving up, letting go – to allow for a break, a rupture from resilience.",

      "title": "TRANSFORMATION OF ‘IDENTITY’ AND ‘SELF’ IN ISOLATION: AN ANALYSIS OF JOSEPH CONRAD’S SELECT WORKS",
      "abstract": "Isolation means living in separation or alone. Isolation can be voluntary or involuntary, it is the synonym of alienate. Alienation is a feeling of being estranged or neglected. The term isolation by definition refers to being apart or to cut off from others, or from the society as a whole. People isolate themselves for various reasons, some try to recharge or heal themselves, or isolate themselves for escapism, atonement, search for identity or just for being peaceful beings all for themselves. The positivity of isolation teaches self-help, patience, gives you the experience and wisdom of your actions, makes you feel the value of your home country and your family and the value of the sweet moments, but unfortunately for people who are driven into isolation struggle in its emptiness and its haunting darkness, it is observed that people who are isolated are driven and compelled to isolate themselves by the circumstances in their lives. In the Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Under Western Eyes the themes of isolation and solitude are very prominent through which the author discusses the psychological condition of his characters and the challenges that human beings by nature are meant to endure, he has even lived those psychological conditions and endured the pangs of alienation. He makes his characters acquaint with this kind of phenomena and that they become the agents to rectify and overcome these obstacles and impediments, another perspective is that isolation and solitude can simply just resonate with the thought of atonement, or to experience a sense of freedom and peace in isolation, escapism or urge for the search of one’s identity.",

The royal or supernatural personages in the fairy-tales are indeed nothing but the disguised embodiments of the child's own wishes. Children of lively temperament are not content with simply hearing pretty tales; they wish to create them themselves, and therefore begin to confabulate. Probably often enough they are first incited to this by the fairy-tales and stories they have heard, but also, there exists in the child at one period an irresistible craving to express in speech the ideas that come surging into his mind; and these confabulations show us in paradigmatic distinctness all the qualities of the connected links of early imagination.",

      "abstract": "Undeniably, growing old is challenging; the physical pain and emotional angst are unrelenting. The tendency is to think there is nothing left to live for; no point in defying the unforgiving mortality chart. Embracing Elderhood offers an alternative to the pessimism that leads to ‘dying before we die!’ It loudly proclaims, being old is about chronology; being an Elder is about attitude. The book is a genuine contribution to the narrative about aging, redefining the concept of Elderhood by asking and answering three important questions. Why am I here? With our lives well past the halfway point, we gain perspective, recognizing how childhood and chance predetermined the role we play in life. Now the question becomes, ‘going forward, is this how I want to live my life?’ The task is to exorcise the shame and regret of the past, finding forgiveness in your heart and redefining your relationship to family, money, society and your inner truth. Why am I still here? We move from the corner office to a corner of the den, reduced in stature by a youth obsessed society, often burdened by illness and personal loss. We struggle to find a reason to get out of bed in the morning that is more significant than still another round of golf. Elders find motivation and purpose by making the behavioral change from self-service to being of-service, using their life’s experiences as social service, making a positive difference in the lives of others. Why was I here? After we have passed, will our loved ones remember us kindly? Will we have made a positive difference in people’s lives? It’s now or never to do what remains to be done and to finally confront any unresolved issues. We are the sages, the teachers, the philosophers with the perspective that only comes with age. But we must speak out. As elders we have an elemental responsibility to teach others and share our gifts.",

      "title": "Have We Gone Too Far with Resiliency?",
      "abstract": "Are we spending too much of our energies charting and applauding the ability of individuals, families, and groups to successfully sustain societal abuse, hardship, and injustice? It has been because of the fear of this possibility that I have never been a big advocate of what is known in the helping professions as “resiliency.” My goal here is not to argue for the abandonment of efforts to enhance resiliency. Instead, my intent is to caution social workers about it. I suggest that we as social workers think more critically about the implications of our advocacy and interventions. Resiliency can be thought of as the ability to withstand bad things happening to you without the expected devastating outcomes. Advocates of resiliency typically attempt, through internal changes of the individual or the strengthening of some environmental support, to allow the person to withstand some negative force and manage to “beat the odds” of negative outcomes (Garmezy, 1974). For sure, withstanding hardship and beating the odds of falling victim to difficult situations are noble as well as romantic aspirations—they have, in fact, a certain quixoticism associated with them. Those in the helping professions who work with poor populations of color have, for some time now, advocated, studied, and talked about resiliency. I believe that we have perhaps taken the resiliency perspective too far. At times, it seems as though we have lost sight of why people need to be resilient in the first place. We too seldom ask the difficult questions, such as “Why do most of our efforts to teach and promote resiliency focus on the poor and, particularly, poor people of color?” “Why do these populations need to be so imbued with resilience and what are called ‘protective factors’ (from whom and what are we protecting them)?” In discussing my reservations about resiliency, I have sometimes used the imagery of a group of children being lined up and each hit on the head with a baseball bat. Researchers then examine this traumatized group in an attempt to determine which few do not have the expected outcome, such as a large knot on the head or a fractured skull. Having once identified this group of atypical positive deviants who are hard headed, exceptional in some way, or just plain lucky, we then attempt to identify which single factor or cluster of factors allowed these “exceptional” children to avoid the natural consequences of being hit on the head with a baseball bat. We then proceed to devise ways to impose or transfer this “strength, skill, or talent” to the majority group of normal children—who are behaving as one should, having been hit on the head with a baseball bat. Clearly, this approach is unfair as it puts the onus of responsibility for averting the trauma on the potential victim. We must ask ourselves: Does this approach enable the victimizers to continue with their bludgeoning of poor groups and at the same time vitiate the demand for greater societal equity and change? Over the years, I have witnessed many people who have overcome astronomical odds to be modestly successful. But the question is: Why must so many poor people and individuals of color be so skilled, so talented, so adaptive, or—as in the case mentioned earlier—so hard headed? Our efforts to promote strength and resiliency models seem to have blurred our vision and taken our eyes off of the big picture, which is to reduce suffering by promoting greater social justice and societal equity. I believe that the seductiveness of resiliency theory has lulled many who attempt to help those at risk of hardship into taking their eyes off those who are swinging the baseball bats. Our rather limited success at significantly improving the lives of minorities and poor people while using this focus suggests that we need to sustain a balanced perspective. We certainly should continue to look for strengths and protective factors, but we must be more willing to acknowledge the problems that the poor and minority",

      "abstract": "We provide here the first bottom-up review of the lived experience of depression, co-written by experts by experience and academics. First-person accounts within and outside the medical field were screened and discussed in collaborative workshops involving numerous individuals with lived experience of depression, family members and carers, representing a global network of organizations. The material was enriched by phenomenologically informed perspectives and shared with all collaborators in a cloud-based system. The subjective world of depression was characterized by an altered experience of emotions and body (feeling overwhelmed by negative emotions, unable to experience positive emotions, stuck in a heavy aching body drained of energy, detached from the mind, the body and the world); an altered experience of the self (losing sense of purpose and existential hope, mismatch between the past and the depressed self, feeling painfully incarcerated, losing control over one's thoughts, losing the capacity to act on the world; feeling numb, empty, non-existent, dead, and dreaming of death as a possible escape route); and an altered experience of time (experiencing an alteration of vital biorhythms, an overwhelming past, a stagnation of the present, and the impossibility of the future). The experience of depression in the social and cultural context was characterized by altered interpersonal experiences (struggling with communication, feeling loneliness and estrangement, perceiving stigma and stereotypes), and varied across different cultures, ethnic or racial minorities, and genders. The subjective perception of recovery varied (feeling contrasting attitudes towards recovery, recognizing recovery as a journey, recognizing one's vulnerability and the need for professional help), as did the experience of receiving pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and social as well as physical health interventions. These findings can inform clinical practice, research and education. This journey in the lived experience of depression can also help us to understand the nature of our own emotions and feelings, what is to believe in something, what is to hope, and what is to be a living human being.",

      "title": "A STUDY ON WORK LIFE BALANCE OF THE EMPLOYEES IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION",
      "abstract": "In today’s fast-paced workplace, most of us are urged to do more, faster, and with fewer resources. There seems to be more pressure to be successful than ever before. While doing the job of two or three people at work, we’re expected to be exemplary parents and have a fulfilling personal life in which we rear perfect children, enjoy our hobbies, volunteer in the community and take superb care of our bodies, spirits, and minds. While the quest for balance is a wonderful goal, it’s just not a realistic goal for most folks. Instead, it has become one more “to-do” on an ever-expanding, guilt-inducing list. There are times when we need to work more than usual and other times when we can take more time off. Sometimes we can focus more intently on our hobbies and passions; at other times different priorities take precedence. There may be times when we take really good care of ourselves, and other times when that slips a bit; times where we devote a lot of attention to our family, and other times when there is less energy and daily time to focus on them. The aim of balance is to live a well-rounded life, to renew and refresh your creative energies on a regular basis so you can achieve your highest potential. We achieve life balance when we have enough time to pursue both work and personal interests that we love. However, when you feel as if one side of your life is using up too much of your energy, you can become stressed, your productivity can fall, and your personal relationships can become strained. The present paper highlights the risks associated with work life imbalance, benefits of healthy work life balance and the strategies that can be employed to maintain a perfect work life balance.",

A person moving around all the time, pursuing simultaneously several goals, entering inaccessible private settings, protecting thoughts and feelings against unwanted detection by interaction partners or observers; all this makes observation and recording extremely cumbersome.

People may not remember or may not find worthwhile reporting what they remember.

      "title": "Winnicott's &amp;quot;Fear of Breakdown&amp;quot;: On and Beyond Trauma",
      "abstract": "Winnicott’s “Fear of Breakdown” : On and Beyond Trauma Max Hernandez (bio) y no hallé cosa en que posar los ojos / que no fuese recuerdo de la muerte [I could find no thing on which to rest my eyes / which was not a reminder of death] —Francisco de Quevedo, “Sonetos” The ubiquitous occurrence of violent events and the growing realization that the inscription of this violence in the psyches of those exposed to these events remains to be known have helped to make trauma an emblematic issue at the end of a century saturated with unprecedented wounding events [see Caruth, Unclaimed Experience].1 Trauma’s enigmatic immediacy thrusts itself upon any attempt to encompass it within a theory. It is as though no one approximates (even the study of) trauma with impunity: complex affects are stirred. A precipitous interplay of cognitive and affective dispositions, a heightened tension between the intense identifications elicited and the need experienced for some protective distance from the pain evoked undermine the stability of the boundaries between witnessing and telling, event and historical narration, narrative and reading. Hence the ambivalent appeal of the notion of trauma for the historian as well as for the cultural and literary theorist. The most cursory description of trauma reflects the complex temporal structure that punctuates the psyche’s relation to the traumatic event. The asymmetrical relation between experience and memory and the gross disparity between their affective and cognitive components are evident at once. Trauma has been characterized by virtue of the disjunctions it manifests. Its very formulation bears the mark of a construction emerging as the narrative of a belated experience.2 In recent publications on trauma, the references to the works of Freud, Janet, Kardiner, Lacan, and Laplanche take pride of place. Also noticeable is the emphasis placed on certain psychoanalytic notions: deferred action, death instinct, repetition compulsion, the real. Along with the explorations of trauma by psychoanalysts, historians, and literary theorists and the ethical issues they bring to the fore, the research of neurobiologists and cognitive scientists has raised a number of epistemological issues. A new wave of radical questioning of psychoanalysis comparable to that of the beginnings of this century shows its force today. The notions of repression and the repressed are considered logical impossibilities; the operations of the unconscious are deemed entirely inexplicable; and [End Page 134] defense mechanisms are considered to be mere verbal paradoxes. In what appears to be a species of defensive tactics, a supposedly neurophysiological rephrasing of psychoanalysis is taking place in some quarters, seemingly oblivious to the possibility of profoundly altering the very cohesion of this theory through the process of revision. Otto Fenichel in the thirties and Masud Khan in the sixties have provided us with succinct yet comprehensive overviews of the manner in which, since the very beginnings of psychoanalysis, every phase of theory making has influenced and reciprocally been influenced by the current concept of trauma and its clinical evaluation. It could be said that psychoanalytic theories are themselves organized around some sort of trauma. This is clearly the case in Freud’s theorizing. After his initial theory where the interrelated aspects of trauma, repression, and symptom formation became problematic, he arrived at the conclusion that castration constituted what might be termed a nuclear structuring trauma. An analogous theoretical point is implied in the Lacanian notion of the splitting of the subject. A normative trauma defines the limits of these theories and establishes a fixed relation between historical structural events. One has to shift perspectives in reading the works of those analysts concerned particularly with object relations. For example, Melanie Klein’s clinical researches on early childhood led her to postulate that the traumatic pathogenic situation par excellence is the overriding triumph of the death instinct. Winnicott understood this situation as entailing the annihilation of the core self by intrusion, while defining the traumatic impingement as the failure of the holding environment. It is relevant to comment on these different perspectives, as they afford the psychoanalytic clinician the possibility of differentiating between structuring (sexual) trauma and narcissistic trauma. When the sexual seduction trauma theory was displaced by the theory that privileged psychic reality, the Oedipus complex became...",

      "abstract": "Most of us, were we faced with a life threatening situation, would try to avoid it; we do not want to die. Yet Lucretius has argued that death can be ‘nothing to us,’ for when death has occurred we don't exist: we can't suffer something if we don't exist. If death can be a misfortune, what is the misfortune suffered, and who suffers it? The misfortune must be suffered by the person who dies, before death has occurred, otherwise – as Lucretius points out – there is no subject to suffer the misfortune. But what kind of misfortune can the misfortune of death be, that a person can suffer it before he or she dies? This question provides the focus of the paper. Our attitudes towards death and life are determined in part by beliefs we have about a variety of things, for example, whether or not there is a life after death. As I shall assume that life ceases at death the attitudes towards death for which I seek explanations will not be universally endorsed; nor are the attitudes towards life, in terms of which the explanations will be given, universally endorsed. My project is not to defend a set of attitudes but to show that the set of attitudes towards life that I consider provide an explanation of a set of attitudes that some people have towards death.",

      "abstract": "The novel, ｢God of the Boy｣ was written right after the end of World War I. Differences of values and the way of thinking or acting could be found in the characters; Senkichi, Congressman A, general manager, owner of a street vendor and so on. Even if it is difficult to go above or beyond one’s own social status, realizing his or her potentials is the starting point of understanding those from other classes. By the term, understanding, it requires actively helping out others. A’s attitude to the boy is passive at first, but does not lose the opportunity and puts it in action. When A met Senkichi by chance, he does not reveal himself but instead buys the boy sushi. Even though he did a good thing, A feels empty and weird as if he has done something bad. Senkichi’s upper curve of his happy and appreciating mind intersects with A’s downward curve of lonely and empty mind. Senkichi’s simple way of thinking and A’s complicated mind is contrasted which can be interpreted as A’s pride and timid attitude coexisting in the inside. This is A’s search for his own self identity and the conflict between what is shown about him in the outside and what is hidden beneath the surface. I believe the boy’s naiveness and A’s confusion in the inside clearly shows the wish to restore humane bond between person to person.",

By becoming more aware of thoughts, emotions, feelings, and physical sensations that arise through life's events, so the possibility of freeing ourselves from habitual and automatic reactions opens up. This then creates the choice of responding mindfully, and in a more skilful and creative way. If the sitting meditation is practised on a regular basis then the opportunity may arise to notice the attention drifting away from an awareness of the present moment. It can then be noted with curiosity and an attitude of friendliness what it was that drew the attention away, and with gentle discipline bring the attention back to moment-by-moment awareness.",

In the mind of a person, there has always been a longing for the state of peace, warmth and carelessness of his native home. However, at the same time, he has an inherent craving for risk, overcoming oneself, and long-distance wanderings. Without this aspiration, it would be impossible to develop the history of the individual and society as a whole. Both of these desires exist both in a physical and spiritual sense. For a full-fledged human existence, both of these poles are necessary: home (stability) and path (change). Home and path correlate with each other as peace and restlessness, comfort and homelessness, sedentariness and wandering.",

Separate from chosen tasks and goals, life can present unchosen difficulties. Building on identity-based motivation theory, people can see these as opportunities for self-betterment (difficulty-as-improvement). People use this language when they recall or communicate about difficulties (autobiographical memories, Study 1; “Common Crawl” corpus, Study 2). Our difficulty mindset measures are culture-general (Australia, Canada, China, India, Iran, New Zealand, Turkey, the United States, Studies 3–15, N = 3,532). People in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD)-er countries slightly agree with difficulty-as-improvement. Religious, spiritual, conservative people, believers in karma and a just world, and people from less-WEIRD countries score higher. People who endorse difficulty-as-importance see themselves as conscientious, virtuous, and leading lives of purpose. So do endorsers of difficulty-as-improvement—who also see themselves as optimists (all scores lower for difficulty-as-impossibility endorsers).",

But the struggle for women to be free is existential in a way that almost no other can be. And it takes place in a broken context, constantly in need of reinventing itself.

For kids, resilience can come in handy when you are faced with difficult problems or new environments. Our resilience is shaped by the things we do and the people in our lives. It changes and grows as we experience new things throughout our lives. We can also increase our resilience by building supportive relationships and modeling our behavior after good role models. Resilience in childhood has a big impact on children’s mental, physical, and emotional health and continues to influence them as they grow older. By building resilience, we can improve our grades in school and enjoy life more, while also feeling less worried and sad.",

Enacting rather than claiming, performing rather than arguing, mediators’ humor reveals multiple meanings and uncertainties, multiple perspectives and their limits, and parties’ needs while generating opportunities to learn. Humor can go wrong, and mediators stress a sine qua non: it must be respectful, never used at the expense of a negotiating party. At critical moments in negotiations, humor can be an important tool, if improvised with regard to tone, timing, affect, and respect. Mediators use humor to deconstruct and reconstruct parties’ presumptions of mediators’ authority; to recognize vulnerability, create moments of intimacy, and suggest possible community; to acknowledge painful histories and enable difficult conversations; to provide safety, release, and new collaborative openings. Mediators’ use of humor can signal possibility and hope and, not least of all, level power to encourage autonomy and build capacity — thus creating deliberative space and encouraging deliberative practice as well.",

      "title": "Doing Waiting: An Ethnomethodological Analysis",
      "abstract": "Waiting is an activity that is virtually carried out by everybody at every time and everywhere. In contrast to other occupations, such as playing the piano, it does not require painstaking training efforts. Notwithstanding, we do possess methodically employed techniques of indicating to others that we are waiting—that is, we make our waiting recognizable as such. Many forms of waiting in everyday life are bound to specific places: waiting shelters, waiting rooms, waiting halls. The waiting person is thus visible and frequently forms a waiting community with fellow waiting people. Moreover, many forms of waiting take a specific form (a queue). But also in situations where such recognizable social formations are not possible (e.g., when waiting alone), people make clear to themselves and to others that they are waiting. Primarily people waiting in publicly accessible spaces demonstrate to each other and to others what they are doing—that is, waiting. They do so in a methodical way and thus make their actions accountable for themselves and others as an ordered structure. Hence, there is a sense in which waiting people wait competently, making their waiting visible to others as a “doing”—a “doing waiting” in the sense of ethnomethodology. The essay pursues the question of waiting people’s particular handling of the space they are in and the material available to them: which spatial resources are made available to them by the specific locality? Which material resources are provided? In what ways do waiting people make use of this space and the objects to which they have access? How do they use other elements of the physical environment? Which additional resources are brought along? The article addresses these questions by using empirical data of natural situations of waiting (ethnographic fieldnotes, photographs, drawings, and video recordings).",

Since there can be no end external to one’s entire life since one’s life includes all of one’s ends, leading and living one’s life as a whole cannot have a point. Finally, I argue that since we live our lives and structure our living-a-human-life efforts both in parts and as a whole, it is fitting to be sad to recognize that leading and living a life is pointless.

The effectiveness of such usage can, of course, vary widely. It can seem tedious and uninteresting if the particular expression has too often been used; or it can seem foolish if it is simply showy or not especially appropriate. But as often as not the effect can be a liveliness of expression that manages to press very closely to the essence of an object or idea while also conveying a strong sense of the speaker’s attitudes and feelings.

      "title": "Gender Difference in Resilience among Undergraduate Boys and Girls with Broken-Heart",
      "abstract": "Loving and being loved adds richness to our lives. When people feel close to others, they are happier and even healthier. According to Wikipedia (2014) broken heart (or heart-break) is a common metaphor for the intense emotional pain or suffering one feels after losing a loved one, whether through death, divorce, breakup, physical separation, betrayal, or romantic In the present investigation, heart-breaks are operationally defined as an overwhelming pain and sorrow which adolescent experiences especially due to failure, disappointment, cheat or rejection in love.Heart-breaks play havoc in adolescents' day-to-day Uves, and have a significant impact on their current mental health, their ongoing development and future romantic relationships. There is an absolute worst feeling for an adolescent, when one is heart-broken. One may actually feel such an intense pain that one does not even want to live anymore. One can not think about anything except for the awful pain all the time and how much one hates the person for leaving him/her, and at the same time desperately wants him/her back. Heart-break literally feels Uke someone stabbing a knife into your chest and twisting it repeatedly (Ashlynn, 2009). At some time 40 % adolescents have felt so miserable that they have cried and have wanted to get away from everyone and everything. During their adolescence, more than 20% think so little of them that life does not seem worth Uving.In spite of these powerful feelings, depression in many adolescents may not be obvious to other people. Some adolescents are better able to handle the stresses and challenges and new opportunities than others. So why does one adolescent try suicide while another in the same tough situation does not? What makes some adolescents better able to deal with life's setbacks and difficulties than others? It is because some adolescents are more resilient as compared to others.Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or workplace and financial stressors (American Psychological Association, 2012). It also states that resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviours, thoughts and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone. Gilligan (2000) defined resilience as 'a set of qualities that helps a person to withstand many of the negative effects of adversity'.Objectives of the study* To have an insight about the socio-personal details of the undergraduates with broken-heart.* To determine the level of resilience among undergraduate students.* To find out gender difference in resilience of undergraduate boys and girls.MethodParticipantsA list of co-educational colleges working under the U.T. Education Department as well as private management was obtained from the internet. From this list, 4 colleges in all, with two each from Government and private college category, were selected randomly. From each selected college, 25 undergraduate adolescents (12 boys and 13 girls, alternatively) who were fulfilling the criteria, that is, belonging to the age group of 17-21 years and had a heart-break in past 6 months to 12 months, were selected. Thus, the final sample size comprised of 100 undergraduate adolescents with equal number of boys and girls (50 boys and 50 girls).InstrumentsSocio-Personal Profile: A socio-personal profile schedule for the subjects was developed by the investigator. It is in English and includes items like name, age, ordinal position, sex, height, weight, complexion, number of earning members in the family, occupation of the parents, average monthly income of the family, family type and relationship status.The Resiliency Scale: For determining the resilience of subjects, a standardized Resiliency Scale developed by Wagnild and Young (1993) was used. …",

      "title": "Are you listening?",
      "abstract": "FigureThe fine art of listening shouldn't be lying dormant in your leadership toolboxes; it should be one of your most frequently used communication tools. Is it? In our daily flurry of meetings and responsibilities with little time to think—never mind engage others—it takes active energy to listen. And this means really listening, not pretending that you're listening. Active listening takes practice and more time than other forms of communication, which may be why we don't use it regularly. However, by not actively listening, we lose an effective way to build relationships and connect with people—from our staff, peers, colleagues, and bosses to our kids and spouses. Our mantra needs to be talk less, listen more. In trying to understand, we have to probe. Ask questions. Clarify. The repeat-back technique we use clinically to ensure that we understand verbal orders or a care plan is the perfect corollary. We should strive to be able to repeat others' points of view, thoughts, or perspectives. If we repeat-back and receive validation that we have it right, then we've truly listened. Years ago, I heard a conflict lecturer give the audience advice on how to handle a disagreement between two staff members: Tell them to come back and explain the issue from the other person's perspective. Brilliant! American psychiatrist M. Scott Peck said, “You cannot truly listen to anyone and do anything else at the same time.” Multitasking is the enemy of listening. Think about it: How much listening are you doing when you're reading e-mails or texting during a meeting? Then there's our tendency to prepare responses in our heads while impatiently waiting (and probably not listening) for the speaker to finish. Body language is important as well. Packing up your desk or rifling through your work pile doesn't signify listening. Your attentive nonverbal responses, such as the simple practices of eye contact and head nodding, can mean more than words. This doesn't seem different from mindfulness; it's actually about being in the moment. Avoiding distractions is so hard in our busy lives, but a great leader will make a concerted effort to take the time to listen with no interruptions. If you're courageous, you'll seek out the viewpoints of those who disagree with you. How better to understand your environment's dynamics than to appreciate all perspectives? You may be surprised to find that others have their own truths, not necessarily in dissent, but different than your own. Acknowledge and repeat to make sure that what's being said and what you hear are the same. It's powerful and a sign to your staff members that you're really paying attention to them. You don't have to agree, but you do have to listen. True communication includes effective listening—an attribute of genuine and authentic leadership, and connectedness with each other. Drop your smartphone, turn off your own thoughts, and open your mind to others. It's worth the effort.Figure[email protected]",

Each choice, each action, each relationship is supported by words which tell much about our origins, our culture, our personality as well as our expectations and desires therefore accompanying our own march. Nowadays it is quite common to hear someone talking about incommunicability when, as they say, words do not come out and stay hidden, halted by too much steadiness. Or else, gossip prevails, and words become too many, but are empty and superficial. We should look for the true and full word; such a word will show us the way to inner knowledge and real communication. Full words, as they are defined by Zambrano, are part of us, make our being, disclose our personality to other people and, by taking shape in an authentic dialogue, they dig inside us, penetrate our guts, until we unveil ourselves in them.",

      "title": "A Kantian Account of Trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract In our societies today, the prevalence of serious, untreated trauma means that we cannot reliably expect to receive or give unconditional love, understood as love which functions within a normative framework to protect each and all of us as having dignity. Serious, untreated trauma makes unconditional love (so understood) unreliable because each time the pattern of the psychological damage (trauma) is triggered in the traumatized person, in the wrongdoers or in the bystanders, their behaviour easily becomes self- and other-numbing, destructive and moralizing in an irrational and often self-deceived attempt to preserve or defend themselves or others against forces felt as threatening even though they are not. It is also common for someone who lives in societal conditions where it is impossible to avoid patterned, traumatizing behaviour to experience the emotional temptation to give up on the possibility of a better future for oneself, one’s loved ones or one’s community within the larger community or the state. For some, this is experienced as a draw towards suicide, while others experience it as a serious temptation to give up on working together with the good forces in society. This article seeks to continue Charles Mills’ work on radicalizing Kant by sketching a Kantian account of trauma and thereby develop philosophical resources that can help us fight historical oppression and violence.",

The prospect of these things to come prompts you to act now, to take some time out of your busy day to do things that will make things possible for your future self. Your future self is, after all, you. At the same time your future self is like a child whose life you are shaping now; you want your child to be happy, and to be someone of whom you can be proud, and who will think back to you fondly. Much of what you do is meaningful only if this child will thrive. Annihilation, ceasing to exist, would bring all of this planning and nurturing to an end. There would be nothing in life to look forward to – no pressing on with the things you presently take to be significant, no fresh undertakings, no future self to look after, no you at all.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "“Am I safe enough for you now?” BPD and the forced erasure of personal identity",
      "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, I explore a number of issues related to a life lived with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Primarily, I am interested in discussing how one unwillingly changes their personal identity by forced medicating—demanded by others implicitly and explicitly. My motivation is something deep and invasive in me. I want to know, I have always wanted to know, why others want me to not be Me so badly. I have thought about this question for years, and though others may simply chalk it up to just one of the standard paranoid or narcissistic traits of borderline personality disorder, there is something more to this question that many of us agonize over most of our lives. There is a deeply normative component to this question that extends beyond the mere fear of abandonment; it is tied to a desire by others to erase—literally—who we are for their own comfort. In this sense, then, I invite you to travel along a path of what it can mean to be a BPDer, from a narrative, phenomenological, and cognitive lived, embodied perspective. My purpose is to show that the treatments for us that others desire cannot avoid (and usually do not want to avoid) the unraveling of who we really are. Whether we want to or not, we give up our self to keep other people with us. And for many, this is too much to ask, and can be one, though not the only, reason suicide and self‐harm seem to be necessary recourses. One in 10 people with BPD commit suicide. So this is a serious matter, indeed.",

      "title": "Failure Is Not Final: Leaders Can Rebound and Achieve Future Success",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Leaders are capable of recovering from failure to accomplish unquestionable success by utilizing strong personality traits, believing in themselves as well as their cause, and cultivating relationships that encourage personal growth. Leaders in every profession fail at some time in their careers. A distinction is made between those who fail and those who are failures. Those who are failures fall from high places; they recoil and do not manage to recuperate and reclaim their previous status. Those who fail understand the role that failure can have towards growth and learn from their mistakes. These individuals utilize set-backs as springboards to propel them forward. For example, the success stories of Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Anthony Tony Dungy demonstrate the value of viewing failure as it should be viewed -- a bump in the road to success. Each of these men battled and won against professional and personal adversity. Their lessons in the profession of arms, politics, and professional sports demonstrate the necessary factors to recover from defeat and emerge triumphant again. In exploring the concept of recovery from failure, one must consider the effects imposed by the common tragedies of life as well. Deaths, marriages, relocations and other unexpected emotional events impact a leader's temperament. These occurrences directly affect one's ability or inability to think and act decisively when responding to failed situations. Accordingly, each of the leaders explored encountered professional failure along with personal hardship, and each successfully moved beyond those failures to achieve future success. Successful leaders sometimes fail in their ventures, which is common for those striving to improve. By leveraging personal strengths, cultivating strong personal and professional friendships, intensely believing in one's abilities, and possessing a sense of purpose, anyone can turn a failed situation into a victorious end state.",

      "title": "Dialogue on Grief and Consolation",
      "abstract": "Have you lost a loved one? The loss can be inestimable, the grief excruciating. What helped you? Did someone say something comforting? Did someone offer a consolation, which you resented? Have you ever tried to comfort someone with a terminal illness or one who has lost a loved one? Knowing how to help or what to say that is not trite, insincere, or superficial can be difficult. The point of view of a grieving person is quite different from that of those who wish to offer comfort. In a multicultural society such as ours, anticipating the beliefs of the grieving person can be even more difficult. This book explores the perspective of a grieving person. It considers the merits and potential harm of alternative comfort strategies. As a philosophical analysis of grief, it emphasizes an understanding of the beliefs that underlie grief and the usefulness or dangers of emotions. Because grief is so complex and sensitive, a narrow approach runs the risk of alienating the grieving person. The ideas in this book are expressed in a dialogue among three characters. Their discussion is broad and fundamental. Starting from the familiar consolation, \"She's no longer suffering\" and the grieving person's resentment toward the expression, the three friends articulate the value of life and the evils of death. Their discussion enriches their understanding of grief. Many consolations offered to mourners are poor arguments. Even the better ones do their work best in the context of a greater understanding of grief.",

      "abstract": "When I think of home I think of resting place[.] When I think of home I think of place where there's love overflowing. --Dorothy in THE WIZ (2) Since the beginning of the recession of the late 2000s there has been noticeable change in the public discourse around individuals and families who find themselves without homes or lacking permanent place to live. The discussion has shifted toward describing the problem as crisis, and devising ways to address foreclosures and away from articulating the fact that people are living on the streets, in their cars, or in shelters and that what needs to be addressed is homelessness. It may seem subtle, but indeed there is difference between focusing on housing rather than homelessness. Though each may be short or long-term, or an acute or chronic condition, housing problem connotes difficulties with the structures themselves, seemingly forgetting that people live or lived there; whereas homelessness brings attention to those people who are going without stable shelter, without place of regular safety, without the real or imagined comforts of home. There is difference between house and home, between housing crisis and homelessness. The articles in this edition, though they do address the housing crisis and its impact, bring the attention back to homelessness and the people who experience it. Several of the authors address population at special risk to become homeless and who are particularly impacted by it. Gary A. Benjamin focuses his analysis on the homeless in the Detroit area, specifically, suggesting solutions to what he describes as a moral dilemma and economic drain. (3) Both Brian Clauss and Margaret Costello consider the particular needs of veterans. Clauss provides insight into the increased risk for homelessness among National Guard and Military Reservists who come from rural areas, noting that, although they struggling with many of the same issues of urban and suburban veterans, their problems are exacerbated by the logistics of reaching services located many miles away. Professor Costello offers broad view of veterans currently experiencing homelessness with particular emphasis on those in Michigan. Next, Nasrat Ventimiglia introduces readers to particularly vulnerable population; homeless youth who identify or are identified as sexual and/or gender identity minorities. In doing so, Ventimiglia demonstrates how they are particularly victimized. Yvonne Vissing addresses children and youth as well, providing comprehensive assessment of, and strategies for, addressing their legal needs. Children and youth, as Dr. Vissing notes, are growing population at risk of becoming homeless with their families or on their own. Finally, Maria Foscarinis frames homelessness as rights crisis. (4) Foscarinis turns to domestic and international locales for models of advocacy done by those who are homeless themselves and on behalf of those who are homeless, much of which is grounded in identifying housing as human right. …",

      "abstract": "When thinking about loss, we frequently consider it in terms of the losses that occur when others die. Yet, non-death losses feature throughout our lives. This arts-based research investigates how we adjust to, and accommodate loss experiences through imaginary dialogue with a dog, along with other creative approaches. As a guidance practitioner, I frequently meet people, whose lives have been altered through illness, disability or unemployment, requiring them to alter their assumptions about their self, others, and the world around them. While many of these losses are apparent, the significance of others are less easily recognised, and indeed, sometimes not acknowledged at all, both by individuals and wider society. There is pressure in a fast moving society to separate ourselves from our experiences and ‘just get on with things’ and those who fail to do so are often considered to be personally lacking. This research demonstrates that by providing safe ‘holding’ environments and opportunities to ‘re-story’ after loss experiences we can make sense of what has happened. However, the emotional impact of our experiences cannot be over-looked and managing internal conflict is essential for a healthier identity to take shape.\r\nI explore the emotional impact of loss by providing my own auto-ethnographic account, as well as the narrative of another person, in order to demonstrate how we make meaning. Different sorts of loss are looked at – non-finite loss, ambiguous loss and chronic sorrow – as well as disenfranchised grief and socio- cultural factors, to provide an understanding of how we respond to situations as we do. Narrative inquiry was selected as the most appropriate way to investigate experience with arts-based methods used to creatively explore the research question. I also provide a snap-shot account of my progress in writing this work to convey the emotional evoked in transitions. As loss is such a prevalent feature of our lives, this research offer knowledge not only to the guidance community, but to everyone.",

      "title": "Editorial: Nursing amidst stories (and knowing what to do with them)",
      "abstract": "Defining stories can be troublesome. Stories are concealed, revealed, shared and withheld. They are noticed, ignored, welcomed, recognised, discredited, neglected and disregarded. A basic definition would suggest that stories are accounts of happenings but they are rarely as simple as they might at first seem. Stories are dynamic: they are formed and reformed through life experiences, through the contexts in which they are told and through the responses which they elicit. They unfold, are individual, occur in the moment of communication, and are subjective. Stories are idiosyncratic: they do not occur in isolation; they gain their meaning and context because they nest within and are embedded in other stories. Stories create bonds between people. We navigate our lives through telling stories, through sharing them and learning from the stories that we hear. Stories are also an essential, albeit often invisible, element of the therapeutic landscape. However, within practice settings, nurses and other healthcare professionals can sometimes ignore, dismiss or trivialise the stories told by patients and their families. It seems paradoxical that relatively little attention appears to have been paid to the value and role of narrative in nursing practice when nursing stakes so many claims to being embedded within a dialogic, relational approach. In this respect, medicine may have stolen the march on nursing, as narrative within medicine is more widely written about. Charon (2007, p. 1265) talks of ‘narrative competence’ and describes this as being the ‘capacity to recognise, absorb, metabolise, interpret and be moved by stories of illness’ and this seems to be particularly apposite for nursing. Patients’ stories may appear to be simple narrations of an event but they often hold clues to complex feelings and responses to illness, diagnosis, symptoms and interventions. By attending to these stories we can learn something of our patients’ fears, anxieties for the future as well as achievements, victories and hopes. Narrative practice is important for all areas of nursing but, perhaps, never more so than when nursing children. When children’s nurses are thinking and working at their best, the child and the family are at the centre of their thinking. Children’s nursing demands that nurses’ hearts and minds are attuned to the needs of children and their families. It requires a commitment to caring alongside children and their families, providing support, information and education whilst orientating the families to their own strengths and sources of resilience. It requires nurses to engage with clinical and other care in a way that allows the family to understand what is happening and how to plan for their future. It is a complex, wonderful practice to be part of. When we nurse well, we can positively contribute to the lives of children and their families; when we nurse inattentively, we can add to a family’s pain, distress, sense of isolation and confusion. Attending to children’s and families’ stories allows us to become a presence in their stories. The very act of telling a story is an act of reaching out to another person. It is a relational act that requires a relational response. Children tell stories to nurses because they expect or hope that the nurse will understand the purpose of the story and respond with it. Our responses do not necessarily have to be complex. Sometimes, all that is needed is an acknowledgement of the story; this in itself recognises the individuality of the child and their experiences. Other times, the stories when children tell require nurses to draw on their experience, expertise and clinical judgement to know how to respond. Children may tell nurses stories when they do not know how to tell their parents because they are worried about frightening or upsetting them. It is possible to complicate stories; to theorise about them, to consider them in an abstract, conceptual and academic way. This is fine (in theory) but in practice stories are complicated enough already. Stories create stories. Narrative in children’s nursing means attending to the multiple stories that spin out from the one child who is ill to the many people who are affected by that illness. Good, important stories, certainly in the clinical sense, are not predicated on an extensive vocabulary or being able to draw on a particular form or structure. Good stories are ones where the child’s story tells us something which we might not have known before, or reminds us of something to which we should be paying attention. Stories can give us access to children’s subjective experiences of illness. Stories can provide a way in for us to understand something of their lives and their explanatory frameworks which may be very different to our own. The stories that children tell are their stories; they are never our stories even when we have become part of them. DasGupta (2008, p. 980) suggests that we need to adopt a stance of ‘narrative humility’ where we acknowledge that, despite our competence and expertise, we cannot pre-empt the end of a child’s story as we can never know how it will end. Stories are always dynamic and co-constructed and, inevitably, this means that they can be ambiguous and paradoxical; different meanings can be drawn from them and different interpretations are always possible. Appreciating this requires us to be reflexive in the way that we attend to children’s stories; including ‘our own role in the story, our expectations of the story, our responsibilities to the story and our identifications with the story’ (DasGupta 2008, p. 981). Whilst we should privilege the child by being attentive and respectful we should not over-privilege ourselves as recipients of their story. Our hearing of the story may be just one telling of it. Some of the stories we are told may only be partial accounts of something that a child needs to work through; something they are trying to understand and make sense of. One of the dangers associated with narrative practice is reifying a story; in treating it as a complete and fully repesentative account. Stories are both more complicated and less complete. The stories that sick children tell are stories about themselves and their experiences, their anxieties, fears, hopes and triumphs. But their stories of illness are also stories of nurses, professionals, their family and their friends and other people who affect their lives and their experience of illness. Their stories are about what they would like to happen, the reassurance and respect they want, their desire to protect their parents and siblings from the burden of their illness and the recognition of themselves as individuals. Their stories are less about being ill and being different and more about striving to be the same and accepted. These are the sorts of stories that adults tell and, despite their youth, children tell stories for similar reasons. It might be truer to say that adults are still telling and need to tell the same sorts of stories that they did as children. Children’s stories reach out in the same way. They reach out in a thoroughly human way. Their stories are a search for understanding. Their stories are a way of helping the child to make sense of their life, their circumstances, their future and their ‘now’. However, the child’s story will not be the only story being told. A child’s family contributes to the constellation of stories that surrounds the child and these, sometimes competing stories, can threaten to overwhelm the child. In a family there can be tension, dissonance and resonance between the stories each member of the family tells, wants to tell or chooses not to tell about the child’s illness. Stories of concern, stories of failure to protect, stories of resistance and persistence, stories of adversity, courage and hope, stories of despair, anger and being ignored. Nursing narratively requires us to acknowledge and attend to all of these stories and to draw upon all of our skills and capacities to respond. We nurse amidst a plethora of stories. Regardless of whether we nurse children or adults we need to develop our capacity to attend and respond to the stories we are told. However, more than simply responding to these stories we need to be able to respond with stories. We need to be able to follow storylines, respect them and not constrain or imprison our patients’ stories within the boundaries of institutional or professional storylines. We need to recognise the power that stories have and how a nursing presence within patients’ stories can mediate the landscape of illness. Nurses can ‘reach across’ to a person whose story is ‘reaching out’; a nursing presence within an illness story has the potential to be a healing presence.",

      "title": "Intimate Wilderness: A Spirituality of Empathy",
      "abstract": "Intimate Wilderness:A Spirituality of Empathy Michele Saracino (bio) A few years ago, I confided in a friend that I wanted to find a workout buddy, a friend with whom I could exercise, so I could have more fun and be more productive at the gym. They responded to me by saying that I must be lonesome. Like a deer in headlights, I felt exposed and vulnerable. Was that true? Was I lonesome, and if so, is that a bad thing? I continued to ruminate, wondering about the intentions of my friend's retort. Were they shaming me for wanting people in my life, and for admitting a need for social connection? Looking back, I believe I could have engaged in that conversation far more fruitfully. It was one of those missed opportunities in which one knows they could and should have said more, something like this: Yes, sometimes I am lonesome. It surprises me too because I have such a full life, but everyone gets lonesome sometimes and hungers for connection. Some more than others I suppose. How about you? I wish I had said that for me and for all of us, including my friend, who in all likelihood has been surprised and confused by feelings of loneliness. Such an honest reaction on my part could have invited an empathetic response from my friend. Carl Rogers, one of the most prominent American psychologists of the twentieth century, asserts the power of being real with clients, an approach that is applicable to interpersonal relationships. For Rogers, being honest creates the potential for \"real relationships\" which are \"vital and meaningful.\"1 Accepting my feelings about needing others in my life and expressing them unapologetically to my friend could have opened up a genuine dialogue about what it means to long for connection with others, and could possibly have allowed us to grow closer. Instead, I recoiled in fear and shame. Expressing feelings of emptiness, isolation, and loneliness is taboo for some and terrifying for many; however, the last thing one needs is less conversation on this topic as loneliness is pervasive, damaging to the human spirit, and even deadly. To be sure, the desire for connections with others is completely normal and to be expected. Theologians and scientists both support the notion that sentient beings thrive in relationships with others in which they believe they are heard, seen, and appreciated. Turning to the first pages of the Bible, specifically to the creation myth of Genesis 2, one encounters a snapshot of the divine that [End Page 173] attends to humanity's loneliness by creating connections for them, \"It is not good that the man should be alone.\" (Gen 18 NRSV). In all of the Abrahamic religions, companionship is part of God's plan for creation. Sociality is part of our destiny; and genuine freedom and flourishing depends on our engagement with others. In addition to religious insights about the importance of connection, there are scientific insights worthy of consideration as well. Since the 1990s, researchers have affirmed the reality of mirror neurons, which \"wire\" us for empathy, specifically they \"fire up both when we experience something (such as pain) and also when we see somebody else going through the same experience. Individuals with numerous mirror cells tend to be more empathic, especially in terms of sharing emotions.\"2 However, feeling what another feels or sharing emotions is just one, albeit important, aspect of empathy.3 Frans de Waal, a renowned primatologist, argues that three aspects or traits of empathy, namely emotion sharing, perspective taking, and concern for others, have developed in mammals throughout history to more or less degrees: The capacity [for empathy] arose long ago with motor mimicry and emotional contagion, after which evolution added layer after layer, until our ancestors not only felt what others felt, but understood what others might want or need. The full capacity seems put together like a Russian doll. At its core is an automated process shared with a multitude of species, surrounded by outer layers that fine-tune its aim and reach. Not all species possess all layers. Only a few take another's perspective, something we are masters at.4 De...",

Many of us are confronted by scary conversations every day: standing up to a toxic boss who is verbally abusive, discussing a niggling problem with a close friend, talking to an interfering mother-in-law or confronting a controlling parent, to name but a few. And of course, everyone would rather avoid having them! Yet by putting off these conversations we often exacerbate the problem, or one day our emotions simply explode. In the process, we lose friends and jobs, damage our marriages and become estranged from family members. In this book, the author illustrates how to manage scary conversations so that you no longer need to fear them. Following tried-and-tested methods, she provides readers with real-life examples on which to model their own conversations, so that they will feel comfortable talking to anybody about almost anything.",

The fault line between political left and right separates differing views on virtue. A good character is honest, courageous and loyal but also in my view someone who can understand and get on with others; a good partner, neighbour, friend, son or daughter, sibling, citizen, colleague, lover and, if he or she has children, parent. I do not rate obedience so highly. Until not so long ago this quality was seen as highly desirable, especially in children, but it is now tarnished by its misuse in the futile battles of the First World War and the genocides of the Second, all carried out under orders. Independence of thought, knowing your own mind and being prepared to defend your views is of greater value to me. This fragile but liberating product of the Enlightenment ‐ the freedom to think whatever you like ‐ is always under threat from orthodoxies of various kinds. So good character has a cultural and historical context that defines it. 1 What is your view?",

      "abstract": "`Listen, listen trust your own strange voice' (psychoanalytically informed conversations with a woman suffering serious illness) ¶This paper argues that the authentic voice of suffering can be denied to people with serious illness. Anguish and expressions of grief are sometimes replaced by joviality. Amid suffering, voices of anguish become strange inner voices that challenge defences of cheeriness and so are avoided, go unheard or are ignored. Bolstered by the everydayness of ward events and hospital life, suppression, repression and denial mean that people with serious illness can suffer without a voice. Listening to others requires the ability to listen to one's own inner voices and recognize how they might guide exchanges. By avoiding conducting conversations in ways dictated by our own fears, worries and fantasies we can listen, and in doing so allow shifts in awareness. Silent suffering can change to expressive suffering allowing a person to reach an autonomous self and so an authentic voice. The seriousness of a situation can be grasped and so life appreciated for what it is. Decisions can be made, business finished and relationships esteemed or otherwise. Through the format of brief therapeutic conversations, listening has a role to play in helping people with serious illness discover their autonomous and authentic voice. The discussion concludes with the suggestion that the need for throughput and roles and tasks demanded on nurses in general settings limits time and resources, and so liaison mental health nursing has a role to play. A specialist practitioner might offer conversational therapies, support nursing and medical staff and teach psychological concepts, thus contributing to an environment in which uncertainty is tolerated.",

      "title": "Entschleunigung",
      "abstract": "Im Leben geht einem so manches verloren: Die Jugend, die Haare, die Geduld, die Merkfähigkeit, das Sehvermögen und vieles mehr. Daneben gibt es auch mysteriöse Verluste zu beklagen: Socken zum Beispiel. Ein jeder kennt dieses Phänomen: Ein Häufchen oder eine Schublade, wo einzelne Socken aufbewahrt werden für die – trotz intensiver Suche – kein Gegenstück mehr zu finden ist. Die meisten Menschen haben ihre Waschmaschine in Verdacht und sind der festen Überzeugung, dass sie es einfach nicht lassen kann, ab und zu einen Socken zu verspeisen. Ein für mich neues Phänomen ist aber, dass ich mich immer häufiger auf die Suche von elektronisch übermittelten Nachrichten mache. Man kann sich den Vorgang ähnlich vorstellen wie die Suche nach dem Schlüssel. Man weiß genau, dass man ihn irgendwo in der Wohnung abgelegt hat, nur nicht genau wo. Zuerst beginnt man die noch einigermaßen nachvollziehbaren Orte zu durchsuchen, wie die Jackentasche, das Sofa oder die Schubladen der Kommode. Mit zunehmender Verzweiflung ist man aber auch bereit den Mülleimer auszuleeren, unter das Bett zu kriechen oder den Siphon vom Waschbecken abzuschrauben. Obwohl ich von mir behaupten würde „Kommunikation ist mein Geschäft“, suche ich in der letzten Zeit häufiger als mir lieb ist nach elektronischen Nachrichten als nach Gegenständen wie Schlüssel, Geldbeutel oder Handy. Die virtuelle Schnitzeljagd läuft dann so: Ich komme ins Büro und kann mich dunkel erinnern, am Morgen beim flüchtigen Checken meiner unterschiedlichen Kommunikationskanäle wie E-Mail, Teams, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, SMS, Rocket Chat und Threema eine wichtige Nachricht der Kulturreferentin des Bezirks Mittelfranken gesehen zu haben, auf die ich natürlich umgehend antworten möchte. Der Übermittlungsweg ist mir leider entfallen. Also durchsuche ich erst mal alle E-Mailfächer (auch den Spam Filter) – nichts. Dann als nächstes Teams: Erst mal den richtigen Kanal suchen – auch nichts. Facebook Messenger – ebenfalls Fehlanzeige. Gut, was nun? Es bleibt leider nur die Verlustanzeige beim Absender: Also anrufen und zugeben, dass man aus Versehen die Mail gelöscht hat und nachfragen, worum es eigentlich geht. Zum Glück ist die Kulturreferentin erreichbar. Im Gespräch stellt sich heraus, dass es keine Mail war, sondern eine WhatsApp-Nachricht. Jetzt fällt es mir wieder ein – nur leider war ich beim Suchen nicht auf die Idee gekommen, das hohe Amt mit etwas Banalem wie WhatsApp zu verbinden. Gut, Problem gelöst. Dann fällt mit auf, dass ich immer noch keine Nachricht wegen des Grußworts der Interdisziplinären Tagungen des JFF bekommen habe und frage telefonisch nach. Die Antwort „die Nachricht ist doch per Teams schon längst an alle raus“ verunsichert mich erheblich, denn: Ich kann die Nachricht nicht finden. Nach längerer gemeinsamer Suche stöbern wir die die Information auf. WO??? Bis heute weiß ich nicht, wie sie da hingekommen ist und wie ich sie dort jemals wiederfinden soll. Aber egal: Teams ist aus meiner Sicht ohnehin ein modernes Bermudadreieck und einzig und allein dafür programmiert, unsere Kommunikation auf lange Sicht wieder zu entschleunigen. Denn genauso wie ich immer noch auf der Suche nach Socken bin, die schon vor Jahren von der Waschmaschine gefressen wurden, so bin ich auch immer noch auf der Suche nach Nachrichten, die mich eigentlich über Teams erreichen sollten – Werde ich dann fündig, überrasche ich Monate nach dem Versenden der Nachricht jemanden kolossal mit meiner Antwort. Am interessantesten ist aber eine Kommunikation über SMS, die ich nur noch mit wenigen Menschen führe, unter anderem mit meiner Frau. Da braucht eine Nachricht von Büro zu Büro für 3 Kilometer Luftlinie mal gut und gerne drei Tage. Wenn das nicht Entschleunigung ist.",

      "abstract": "When unmourned experiences of helplessness and disavowed desires turn into a passive fatalism, people stop hoping for the best and fear the worst, despairing that the real world has anything good to offer. This can lead individuals to memorialize past sufferings through psychological symptoms and compulsive repetitions. Dr. Shabad discusses how patients, after many years of living a life limited by resentment, fear, and despair, can come to terms with their childhood experiences: a mother who can never be satisfied, a father who consistently buries his head in the newspaper. He explains how people can overcome hardships endured and losses suffered. The authentic spontaneous dialogue between therapist and patient provides the generosity and courage necessary to shed their now obsolete defenses and mourn what cannot be remedied or replaced. Rich clinical material demonstrates how mourning can bring about self-acceptance, and set individuals free to take responsibility for and live out their own personal truths. This is a deeply felt, and beautifully written tribute to the redemptive power of psychotherapy and to the regenerative capabilities in all human beings.",

      "title": "Alternative Responses to Life in Tillie Olsen's Work",
      "abstract": "In archetypal or mythic literature, a woman is often viewed as source of information about things for which a man has no eyes, namely, inspiration and personal feelings, and as the bearer of soul-image, anima, love.2 Included in many of these virtues is understanding, or ability to learn from life's experiences and to teach others what you have learned, to accept but to try to do what you can about inequities of life, to sense needs of others, to share with others as much kindness and love as possible and to be aware of other values in life beside material possessions. Before one can understand, however, one must question. Looming over Tillie Olsen's short story collection Tell Me A Riddle and her novel Yonnondio From Thirties are seemingly inconsequential, but actually very important questions such as: And when is there time to sift, to weigh, to estimate, to total?3 is it like it is?4 Humankind one has to believe So strong for what? to rot not grow?'and Who's to look out for . Who's to care about 'em if we don't? who?6 Consequently, we readers raise our own questions. Why are these inquiries so important in short stories and novel? Olsen is pointing to more than superficial knowledge of situation in Oh Yes and other stories. For example, when Carol, in short story Oh Yes is frightened at church baptism of her friend, Parry, Parry's mother tells her You'll feel better if you understand (p. 50). This comment hints at enormous importance of understanding, (the hopedfor result of questioning) in all of her work. In earlier short stories such as I Stand Here Ironing (1953-54), Olsen seems to hint at thematic importance of a woman understanding herself and her own behavior in response to",

      "title": "How to Be Less Wrong More Often",
      "abstract": "If you suffer with the popular neurosis of needing to be right as often as possible--or, less neurotically, if you want to be less wrong more often--here's trick from general semantics that will help get you there. Speak Probabilistically In general, the common tendency for people is to trust their nervous systems. They tend to believe that if they saw it, they intimately know about it, or if they have experience with it, they confidently know what will happen next. For example, an extra on film set may observe lead actor yelling at crew member. He may go tell other extras the lead was He may quickly add that it is going to be long day as result. extra may express these statements with absolute confidence in his observations and conclusions. As listener, you have no inkling this extra believes the lead might not be or the day might not go long. It is this certitude that makes the extra painfully wrong when he is faced with the reality of short day, during which it was revealed the lead was joking around with the crew member, playfully in character, not actually Had the extra spoken probabilistically about what he observed, he would have ended up less wrong when faced with information contrary to his claims. General semantics teaches people to be suspicious of their nervous systems, and under that suspicion, to speak with probability (uncertainty) rather than with certainty. Being wrong is not necessarily problem, but in case it is, speaking probabilistically can help toward being less wrong more often. How to Speak Probabilistically Speaking probabilistically is quite simple. It tends to involve just adding words like or to any claim you want to make. Simply by adding these kinds of words, you dramatically and significantly change what you are saying and even what you are thinking when you make claim. Saying The lead actor was upset makes you decidedly wrong when the truth is revealed that the actor was fine. However, adding the word and saying, The lead actor was probably does not make you as decidedly wrong when the truth is revealed that the actor was fine. In fact, by adding the word probably, you explicitly concede there is the possibility the lead actor was not upset, and when you are shown he was fine, you are less wrong than if you expressed with certainty that he was When you add the word instead of probably, you get similar but slightly different effect. When you say, The lead actor was possibly you communicate there is probability the lead actor was not When it is revealed the lead actor was fine, you were not decidedly wrong because you conceded in your speech the potential that he was fine. You were less wrong than had you expressed with certainty that the lead was Conditioning Yourself to Speak Probabilistically Speaking probabilistically is habit that can be conditioned when you pay attention to what you say and write, and when you correct certainties as you express them. To speak probabilistically and find yourself less wrong more often, each time you find yourself making strong claim that implies certainty about your take on events, immediately correct yourself and restate by adding in the word or possibly. That is, if you catch yourself saying something like The lead actor was promptly rephrase your statement and follow up with, I mean, the lead actor was probably upset. By correcting yourself immediately, you start to recondition yourself into new habit of speaking probabilistically. As result, more than likely you will start to make probabilistic statements before making certain statements. Sooner or later, you will find that you speak probabilistically regularly, and you speak with certainty rarely. Precautions When Speaking Probabilistically In common parlance, the word suggests a chance greater than 50%. …",

Usually, we think of grief and loss in terms of dealing with the death of a loved one through an unforeseen circumstance or after a chronic illness. But considerable sorrow is also a part of the dissolving of an intimate relationship, divorce, or friendship, or other less commonly considered life experiences that also involve significant changes to one's daily experience. Experiences with loss and grief are uniquely personal experiences. The purpose of this chapter is to share my experiences with loss and grief, the contingencies surrounding them (to the best of my recollection), the importance of the communities who supported me, and to describe how my experiences with loss and grief have collectively impacted my trajectory and my repertoires as they manifest in my roles as a daughter, sister, aunt, friend, student, colleague, mentor, and professional. The stories that I share are deeply personal; they detail the intimate nature of my journey with loss and grief. It is intentionally high context, which may be surprising to some readers. It is also an opportunity, perhaps even an invitation, for the reader to share in the vulnerability we each experience after a significant loss, and to reflect on their own experiences with loss and the grief that ensues.",

      "title": "The Thrown Leader",
      "abstract": "The term “thrownness” designates our inevitable submission to life’s challenges and predicaments, often determined arbitrarily by chance or by destiny. We inescapably find ourselves thrown because the world matters to us in some way or another. The term has major implications for effective leadership since leaders are invariably thrown into vexing circumstances or inherit problems that they had nothing to do with creating in the first place. Effective leaders attend to and “throw off” their thrownness by choosing judiciously from those possibilities (actions) that are available to them in a particular situation. Our “being” as leaders is always a struggle between thrownness and possibility because the undertakings we engage in and the people we interact with—our students, our colleagues, and our families—matter to us in some way or another. We care about our future and the future of our work; that’s what makes the sting of being thrown so raw. But rather than avoiding or disengaging from their challenges, authentic leaders take responsibility for what was, what is, and what will be, regardless of the circumstances they are thrown into. Acceptance of the randomness and inevitability of being thrown, with its associated aggravations and annoyances, is a hallmark of effective leaders. This grants leaders a somewhat paradoxical gateway to freedom, a journey on which they can discover purpose in their thrown humanity.",

Most of the persons we serve come to us out of necessity, struggling with the sequelae of disease and illness or the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters. We bring our expertise and compassion; they bring their bodies, minds, and compromised lives. Our worlds converge around a shared task: identifying and enhancing their capacities for daily living. We pursue problems of movement, perception, cognition, affect, and social capacity within the context of their roles and aspirations. Our contacts may be extensive, but often they are brief and only partially fulfilled. Our patients move on with varying degrees of functional ability – some with determination and buoyancy, others with little confidence that life is actually worth living. We remain, frequently knowing little about the factors that have influenced the outcome of our efforts, in spite of their compelling importance to our patients, our professional viability, and the health care system.",

      "title": "One Life to Lead",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is a truism that each of us has one life to lead. But we rarely ask what it means to lead a life, perhaps because the answer strikes us as obvious. In fact, though, leading one’s life requires that we negotiate some deeply puzzling aspects of our experience and overcome some profound challenges to our sense of ourselves and our place in the world. This book develops an “attachment-sensitive” conception of what it means to lead a recognizably human life. In so doing, it reveals some hidden complexities that are latent in our understanding of ourselves and our lives. The book focuses on two interrelated dimensions of our experience: the temporal and the interpersonal. Many of the puzzles and challenges we must negotiate concern the passage of time, which shapes and frequently unsettles our emotions, our attitudes, and our understanding of ourselves. Other questions concern our determination to form and sustain valuable personal and social attachments, even though doing so requires us to share authority with others and renders us vulnerable to grief, loss, and pain. The investigations of the temporal and interpersonal dimensions of our experience remind us that although our capacity to view our lives in broader perspective is extremely important, we cannot undo our social and temporal specificity. We lead our lives, and can hope to lead good lives, not by systematically transcending our selves or our attachments, as some traditions and thinkers have urged, but by engaging with the world as we find it.",

It is better to be intoxicated by hope than to be rationally choked by despair. 1 Emotions are good, even those which are negative, if we know what to do with them. We all experience fear, anger or worry. Most of us succumb to them and go numb. Despite everything that has been said, the pace or position of emotions in relation to logic is of only minor consequence. Human beings create excellence when they superimpose their creative thoughts on their emotions. This is how despair turns into hope and hope turns into achievements. This creates a faultless body and a blameless mind. The two together create abundance. Hope is a feeling and a sensation based on what will happen in the future. Since hope is a positive emotion, the feeling of what will happen in the future, is also positive. Despair and hope are complimentary. There can be no despair without hope. Faith is complete trust or confidence. Ambition becomes sublime when it becomes an aspiration. Hope should not just have a place in our lives. It should be life itself. Hope is the feeling we have when we are in love. It is not necessarily for anything in particular. Hope is grace despite darkness, because of our ability to convert darkness into light. Hope is enjoying the journey while we achieve our objectives.",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF INJURY ON AN ATHLETE",
      "abstract": "The blissful mental state of being on the court or the playing field is like no other feeling in the world. For most, being an athlete becomes their identity; being an athlete is embedded in their soul. It is an inner life, an inner fire. When one yearns for something, they sacrifice all they can to achieve success. It is not only about the success; the fact that one can truly create something within themselves that lifts their self-worth makes an athlete willing to give up everything (e.g., family, social life) and reach for nothing more. When an athlete with a promising future succumbs to a career-ending injury, it can be devastating. It has been hypothesized that individuals who derive their self-worth solely from their identity as an athlete are at increased risk for depression after experiencing an athletic injury (Brewer, 1993; Heil, 1993). The range of emotions that they experience is tumultuous at best. Sports have been on a constant fast developmental track. Due to this pace of development, the expectations from players has increased manifold. At all levels of sports, an athlete is under constant stress of performance and this stress increases when the athlete is passing through injury phase because injury not only effects the athlete physically but also mentally. This phase of injury is very critical in an athlete’s carrier. This phase can help the athlete to grow stronger and bounce back or it can even end the athlete’s carrier.",

      "title": "My story: a spiritual narrative",
      "abstract": "Think of a shy, obsessively studying teenager terrified of failure. Think of a solitary schoolgirl, practising the violin devotedly every break time. Think of a confused, guilt-ridden, lonely and struggling student. Think of a mute, motionless patient on a psychiatric ward, in despair. Think of a person coping independently, doing voluntary work. Think of someone feeling fulfilled and happy for the first time in life. All these things describe my life at different stages. I have been a mental health service user for 30 years with many ups and downs. Here I write my journey, through illness to comparative wellness, as a ‘spiritual’ narrative. In common with most people (Rogers et al , 2002), my spiritual experiences have always been in a state of flux. Sometimes my faith has seemed more important and sometimes the music, sometimes both at once. Sometimes one or other or both have been positively unhelpful. Sometimes these experiences have been linked to periods of mental ill health and sometimes not. To make sense of this, it is necessary to study my spiritual narrative from my earliest memories (Cardano, 2010; Moran et al , 2012). This is helpful to me as an individual, but also can have implications for others in a similar situation (Gockel, 2009; Kogstad et al , 2011). Of course, this is anecdotal, but I hope that it will provide ideas for future research. My journey Experiencing religious well-being One of my earliest memories is when I was about 5 years old and unable to sleep one night. It seemed to me that God was telling me that I must become a missionary, healing the sick in foreign lands, somewhere where the people had nothing, no medicines, no hospitals. Yes, I said to God, I will do that. I was very happy about it and believed I might be able to really ‘make a difference’. I told no one, not even my parents, but I fantasized about it. It is always hard to know how to interpret these kinds of experiences. However, my religious beliefs were certainly sincere and provided me with the sense of meaning and purpose that we would call religious well-being.",

The journey comes true through the memories, strong and meaningful lived experiences, keeping an open look at what remains to be discovered and understood on himself, on his own existence. So many aged appear to be close to the end of life with more curiosity than fear, with a view to understand and clarify unknown aspects of himself. For many people, the art represented the field and the instrument of exploration, discovery, communication of their creativity. You're never too old when you have something to say, to do, to think, to plan, to be invented. Aging reflects a creative journey, from the beginning to the end. Every day it is possible to learn new things, to write unusual pages of personal story. Curiosity and creativity stimolate to discover unknown topics, to challenge continous adventures, to realize new experiences. Great artists were able also in old age to produce new creative expressions; at the end of the journey they succedeed in self realizing, in finishing their communication with life by creative inspiration, sometimes in a humorous way.",

Why do we so often mistrust the motives of our own deeds, thinking them fake, though the beneficiary of them gives us full credit? Much of this book deals with that self-tormenting self-consciousness. It is about roles and identity, discussing our engagement in the roles we play, our doubts about our identities amidst this flux of roles, and thus about anxieties of authenticity.",

However, achievement and action are not the only way of making life meaningful. Other aspects of life that enrich the meaning are experienced. Experience has value because it can compensate therapeutic demands from outside of us to achieve a success. Individuals can meet the meaning of life not only through the achievement and through experience, but also through suffering. Suffering a painful stimulate individuals to develop. The meaning of death is an individual concept of positive or negative, conscious or unconscious, or something that is impossible. When facing of death, people in general do not like, even very frightened to death. Individuals to imagine death as a very tragic event and horrible. However, humans can only be received with great fortitude, patience and courage of all forms of suffering that can not be done to stop. Acceptance with sincere and steadfast tragic things that can not be circumvented longer be able to change one's view of the previously characterized merely suffering a view which can see the meaning and lessons of suffering.

      "title": "Racism: The age‐old elephant we need to start acknowledging in every room",
      "abstract": "When I was asked to contribute to this issue, I will admit there was a moment of reluctance. In past times, I feared not being enough or mirroring the expectations others have for an Aboriginal person. Nowadays, it is less about others and more about me; will I find value in this or is it just another tokenistic attempt to be seen as inclusive. This piece requires me to share my own personal experiences and I am conscious this can provoke emotions for me, but also for my fellow Aboriginal trainees. This article reflects my own lived experiences and does not represent my Indigenous colleagues' individual journeys. I would like to acknowledge my brothers and sisters, their mob, their voice, their hard work, and recognise their experiences as holding immense value in the future of emergency medicine. To maintain my own integrity, I will not hide or lessen my experience in order to protect the feelings of others. Racism and bias is etched in Aboriginal history and I am not in the business of pretending cultural competency modules alone preclude it from being present in our EDs. We must be open, honest and willing to learn from each other in order to move forward as a community we all can belong to. I will not be using referenced works to validate my experience. Traditionally, Aboriginal people have had their stories discounted because they are not preserved by methods valid in Western culture. If this makes you question the legitimacy of this piece, I urge you to return to the beginning and start again. My cultural bloodlines come from Murrawarri, Ngemba and Wiradjuri country and is more complex than simply a stamp on a piece of paper. My experience as an Aboriginal woman is interwoven with a long, strong and proud connection to family, community and culture. I live, work and breathe proudly on Wiradjuri country as an Advanced Trainee, servicing a large rural and remote population in Western NSW. When talking about racism in the ED, I hope the majority of people and departments have absolutely no tolerance for any racially motivated statements or behaviour. What is often neglected and what I more commonly see are the subtle undertones of unconscious bias most people do not even recognise. I am cautious in my approach as advocacy is often perceived as hostile and confrontational, rather than one that can provide a valuable insight into the interface of Aboriginal patients and the healthcare system. When standing at the journey board discussing patients, I hear the change in tone as we speak about the Aboriginal woman who has presented again with the same non-healing diabetic foot wound. I hear the comments and the backhanded remarks blaming her choices as being the sole reason she is in this position. It is the lack of appreciation for this woman's lived experience and the failed attempt to understand her untold story and appreciate how environmental factors beyond her control may have contributed to the current situation. If we acknowledged her story, we would recognise the discharge plan written is unrealistic and in fact setting the patient up to failure. Standing, listening and watching the conversations unfold demonstrate the unintentional assumptions staff make, because repeatedly I need to highlight oversights and explain why we need to adapt to the situation at hand. As an Aboriginal doctor, I have a sense of duty to protect and advocate for my mob, something I am unapologetic for. I am often left feeling the contention between colleagues as I interrogate comments or decisions to ensure Aboriginal patients are benefiting from our clinical judgements. My most feared patient is the young Aboriginal man who presents with abdominal pain. He is completely misunderstood, and his severe pain interpreted as aggression, his hesitancy to give a comprehensive history at triage further supporting the initial assumption that he is probably drug seeking. He is offered paracetamol and sat in the waiting room with a perforated bowel continuing to deteriorate. When we profile our patients as being aggressive, we create prejudicial undertones that negatively influence our ability to remain objective. When we get it wrong, we are often quick to place the blame on the patient, because observations outside the flags alone are not enough when he is well enough to go outside for a cigarette. These assumptions about patients cloud clinical decisions and delay early recognition of deterioration. We routinely throw around superficial comments like ‘Aboriginal people are high risk’ but fail to understand what high risk means, recognise high-risk patients and implement strategies to ensure Aboriginal people are not left clinging to the cracks we have created as they are falling through. It is the overwhelming discontent as I sit in the morbidity and mortality meetings, being reminded this is not a place for blame, rather an opportunity to learn from our mistakes. Time and time again, we discussed another Aboriginal person who has inadvertently suffered during their encounter with the healthcare system. I sit there doubting if I really am making a positive difference; while it feels like the rest of the room have not recognised the common theme that the last three patients we have discussed are Aboriginal people. Starting a conversation and advocating for our mob is again challenging, because acknowledging that a clinical decision inadequately considered the cultural needs of a patient, which has resulted in a poor outcome, is rarely welcomed. Constructive conversations around the lived experiences and the historical relationship some Aboriginal people have with the healthcare system are avoided, because most appear unable or uncomfortable with contributing to a productive discussion owing to knowledge gaps or fear of being labelled a racist when in fact this is not the intention. We need to start understanding where the fears and vulnerabilities of our Aboriginal patients are derived from and why they are important to consider when Aboriginal people are seeking help to ensure our own biases are not influencing our decisions. Finally, I am privileged to work in emergency medicine and I am honoured to share my experiences. My intentions are to help other colleagues develop skills that will positively promote healthcare for Aboriginal people. I have tried to demonstrate it is less about racism and more about the assumptions held that negatively influence outcomes for Aboriginal people. As I transitioned throughout the training programme, I have found that having the uncomfortable conversations tends to spark constructive reflection for staff, which in turn can positively impact the way we deliver healthcare to Aboriginal patients in the ED. My hope is that we can continue to reflect and learn from each other's experiences, and strengthen our relationships within all communities. None declared.",

      "title": "Something Has to Happen",
      "abstract": "Something Has to Happen Natalie Babbitt (bio) It has occurred to me recently that there is a difference between juvenile and adult fiction, which is so obvious that it has somehow escaped at least my attention, though I and all of us who write for children have always had to deal with it: child heroes, like their flesh-and-blood counterparts, being powerless, innocent, and mainly unformed, are acted upon rather than acting. That seems simple, and yet it profoundly affects the construction of a story and defines a fundamental variance between the two literatures. Since the child hero is acted upon, there has to be a plot to a children's story. Without exterior action there can be no story at all. Interior action —that is, the workings of characters' thoughts, personalities, and accumulated experience of their own lives and those of the people around them —is rare in children's books. Children, and by association child heroes, haven't been around long enough; they are not experienced enough to be much guided by reflection, and have very little control over their own lives. Things must, therefore, happen to them, things from which we hope they will learn. And things happening is simply another term for the unfolding of a plot. Things used to have to happen in adult fiction, too, but not any more. Short stories in The New Yorker, for instance, are mostly devoid of events. They have no discernible plots. The idea of things happening is so unusual nowadays in adult fiction that Joseph Heller could call his second novel Something Happened and keep us turning the pages to find out what in the world it would turn out to be. I suppose you could say that modern adult fiction accurately reflects modern adult life, at least here in safe and insulated America. Nothing much does happen to most of us, after all —nothing you could call an adventure —unless we make it happen, which fact is apt to come as a distinct surprise. Perhaps this is why adventure novels, and adventure movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark, seem to critics to be fare only for the unsophisticated —escape fare which bears no relationship to reality. But whether this is true or not, there is a difference even between adventure novels and movies for adults and those intended for children. Even though the action in both is all exterior, the heroes are different: the older ones act, the younger are acted upon. [End Page 7] You could probably make the claim, without too much fear of contradiction, that all stories for children are adventure stories, if by that you mean stories in which the action is exterior. This may be too broad an interpretation of the term \"adventure,\" and yet it would be difficult to find a children's novel in which the child hero does not have an adventure of some sort, an adventure on which the plot hangs and from which the child hero will learn the necessary lesson. For there must be a lesson, though that is a more disagreeable way of putting it than to say that the hero must change somehow and thereby grow. Child heroes will always change somehow, even though they are almost always the tools of the action rather than its initiator. The rare child hero who does initiate action must do it in secrecy, and always in fear of being discovered by an adult. There is exhilaration in the secrecy, perhaps, but it is also inhibiting and makes these heroes furtive little people, while the adults around them come off as remarkably obtuse and credulous. The children in the movie E.T. keep their alien hidden till the very end. They can do nothing overt. They know, like Mary and Colin in The Secret Garden, that they will not be allowed to act if their project is known. It would seem that we are not saying anything very healthy about honesty and authority in stories like these, but they do reflect the fact that if children are to act, independently and imaginatively, if they are to make things happen, they must, as in their fiction, be...",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

The significance of speaking about leading a passionate life, I submit, is found in the spontaneous, embodied character of opening up to and finding meaning in one’s life rather than in heightened fleeting feelings or experiences of meaning that help one forget life’s meaninglessness. I contrast this view with Simone Weil’s suspicion that our passionate attachment to another person is an obstacle to attending to him or her from the distance proper to love and friendship. From that perspective it appears as if the meaning with which personal love endows life is mostly illusory, including the loss of meaning characteristic of grief. I question whether Weil’s view should be seen as an unconditional, though for most unattainable, ideal of love, or if it is rather expressive of a rejection of one of the central features of love: the vulnerability that ensues from the recognition that when we love there are times where we stand in need of the other’s love to be able to embrace life as meaningful.",

He has also rediscovered a very old truth: Reflection is a spiritual discipline, much like meditation or prayer. A path to faith and heart. He knows the road ahead is still long and difficult.

Starting with supporters of the French Revolution, hope has served as shorthand for progressive politics. I start my literary history with the classical counterpoint, in which hope is at best problematic, something in need of regulation and restraint if not extirpation. I then turn to Judeo-Christianity, and European and American Romanticism, and offer a preliminary sketch of the reasons why hope features as a good thing in these over-lapping but distinct contexts.",

The benefits of accepting are described by many cultures through religious literatures (New Testament, Tao Te Ching, Buddhist Scriptures, Bhagavad Gita or \"The Divine Song\", Yoga Sutras of Patañjali), philosophical (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Keirkegaard, Krishnamurti, Lao Tzu, Watts), as well as in other various literary forms such as romance (Austen), modernism (Nabok), realism (Tolstoy), poetry or theater (Shakespeare). Acceptance requires a person to tolerate experiences as given; otherwise, simply someone will only pursue pleasure, run away from pain and be prone to judge experiences. The Stoics (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca) appreciated the ability to tolerate or willingly resist experiences, because it increases the degree of self-control, of detachment without emotion and develops indifference to pleasure and pain. Since acceptance involves contact with reality as it is at a certain moment, it is necessary to be able to remain present and aware even when the available stimuli are less desirable. Consequently, tolerance can be considered a skill through which we can remain present and experience anything that happens completely.",

      "title": "Behind the Mask: Does the Self-doubt Ever Go Away?",
      "abstract": "During the comfortable cocoon of my intern year, I was not really indoctrinated into the world of orthopaedics. Second year is the traditional year when one officially becomes an orthopod, and along with it, obtains an additional layer of responsibility and autonomy. And while the steep learning curve certainly contributed to my anxiety about moving up the ranks, most of my angst stemmed from the expectation that my colleagues—nurses, other residents, worried parents, technicians, even other attendings—would begin to look to me for guidance and answers. Of course, one is never truly alone, though it may feel that way at times. There is always a senior resident or an attending available. There are safety nets for the safety nets. Nevertheless, I woke up one day as the designated musculoskeletal expert, however reluctantly. One would expect that as the months roll by and the repetitions of reductions and managing acute traumas accumulate, I would start to build some confidence, maybe even an ego. But somehow, as I accrued more experience, I uncovered more “known unknowns.” And while my co-residents seemed to gain more confidence and even develop a certain swagger, I only saw the ladder of residency grow longer and steeper. The trauma team here—of which I was a part—cared for one patient recently; I’ll modify his details somewhat for privacy. He sustained severe polytrauma, including several open fractures, which were distracting both to him and to us. Although we thought that we had performed a thorough job of surveying the patient, and we believed that we had managed his injuries well, we missed a rather obvious tibial plateau fracture. We received an admonishing email from our trauma attending the next day. In the scheme of things, this was a slap on the wrist, given that we had committed what felt to me to be an almost unforgivable error. After that incident, the level of paranoia in my mind grew high—a checklist is no match for a junior resident. Despite the early mistakes, I felt that my colleagues started to trust me a little more. There must be a modicum of acceptance of second-year residents for a hospital to function. Being a consult resident is akin to playing a complex, high-stakes game of telephone—my job is to dictate the initial message as clearly and succinctly as possible so that the message remains just as clear and accurate when it reaches its destination. How I compose the presentation of a patient will ultimately determine the course of that patient’s treatment. I’ve since learned that my tone matters. My biases cannot muddy the message. One night, a patient presented with a cat bite on her hand. I told the senior resident on call that it was a routine cat bite, one of those consults from the emergency department that did not warrant a consult. Our team discharged the patient with some antibiotics and wound care instructions. But after her discharge, we took a closer look at the photos of her hand and found that one of the wounds may have penetrated a joint. Should we have admitted her or even considered taking her to surgery? Absolutely. But that didn’t occur; I didn’t get the tone right in my message. If anything, I became more uncertain of my skills over the course of the year, as I accumulated a collection of blunders from the seemingly endless consults. I became more suspicious and skeptical of my own exam findings during subsequent patient encounters. Alas, the constant self-questioning has led me to never be at complete ease with any patient or clinical question. And rightfully so. To paraphrase one of our attendings, residents should always be in some level of discomfort and on edge. It is at that sweet spot where learning and progress make the greatest strides, where knowledge is the stickiest.",

When I obey my own advice, I sometimes risk isolation. The poem won't let up, won't release me until I've attended to it draft after draft after draft. The process can make me otherwise absent-minded and absent-spirited. I put life outside my writer's cell on hold. While living alone makes it easier for me to commit myself to writing, it also intensifies my isolation and self-absorption. I have to remind myself social ties and norms are desirable. I tell myself I am not by nature an outsider, eccentric, non-conformist, or rebel. After all, I am a teacher. And the worlds inside and outside the classroom have been a constant source of inspiration. The writer's calling is not a team effort; it's a lonely lot, a solitary pursuit. What begins with talent, a gift for self-expression, demands practice, practice, practice. On days when the air feels dead instead of alive with all the right words, I wonder whether I want the rewards of writing praiseworthy poems enough to risk slipping over the edge of discipline and perseverance into detachment or disengagement, even estrangement. It happens to some of the artists whose art outlives them. Immortality in exchange for fellow-ship and emotional balance is not necessarily a voluntary tradeoff for the artist. I'm fascinated by the lives and achievements of great artists. To be sure, Vincent van Gogh is an extreme example of anguish and disorder. Even so, I can understand the despair that compels someone to reject the best part of himself. The central moment in my poem focuses on his penultimate act of self-repudiation. Destroying his work was like taking his own life because his work was his life. Maybe the destruction was not so much a matter of genius betraying itself, as it was his protest against art as his only course, and the sacrifice and cost it exacted. Facing facts can feel like being defeated by fate. So the wipeout of our labor becomes a prelude to suicide. Sick with depression and blinded by gloom, we are driven to strike out especially against ourselves. Or existing reality makes a person feel like a failure and so it dissolves into illusion and, worse, delusion. Imagination can be a force for good or bad. It can be liberating and grace our endeavors or it can distort and plunge us into the depths of despair that drive us to self-abasement. When fame and fortune elude us and even break the spirit, I wonder why any of us keep at it. But the will to be creative—to master the medium (i.e., fill the blank sheet or canvas with our take on the world)—keeps us practicing. It makes me believe that true artists have no choice; they simply must write or paint or compose. And feeling born to it and giving themselves over to it wholly are what sets them apart from the commonplace. All of us, I think, at best and at the least, want to communicate. I know I want my poems to surprise, amaze, and delight other people. I want the power to deliver a telling message; the nuggets of truth I think are worth passing on. That need is one aspect of being uniquely human. We are not the only creatures on this planet with language, but we are the only ones who can record and preserve what we say and sing. Unlike Orpehus, I can't make the stones weep. Nevertheless, my poems are bearers of human news and my way of getting even on death.",

Starting from the assumption that in each man’s life there are situationsof helplessness, i.e. border situations, the authors look for possibilities to overcome them. They establish two kinds of behavior characteristic for a man who experiences suffering in its diverse forms: in the first one, a man expresses his rebellion and rejection; in the other one, he is looking for the meaning of his suffering and the possibilities to accept it. Concentrating on the second situation, the authors point to religion, which in many cases facilitates man’s reconciliation with what he cannot overcome by himself. They stress the importance of Christian hope, which reveals to a man the prospects of transformation of his difficult and painful fate into a life without suffering and death. They also point out to the need to undertake far-reaching pedagogical activities that will prepare a person for such a painful eventuality.Being aware of lack of a definite answer to the posed question, the authors note that a man can be shown the way in his quest. In his search, a man is helped by Godwho comes to him through Revelation described in the Bible. They also note that in order to accept the religious explanations, a man needs to grow emotionally andspiritually throughout all his life.",

      "abstract": "A dialogical understanding of our being-in-the-world begins with the assumption that “to be is to be with. ” But to be in relation, to enter into dialogue with another, requires the uniqueness and otherness of individuals. We are locked into ourselves or lost to other selves if we cannot, through our imagination, entertain the possibility of otherness. The otherness is mediated by symbolic or expressive language which enables dialogue to occur in which both the speaker and the hearer (or author and reader) participate. Out of the dialogue of life lived in relation grow the stones of who we are both as individuals and as communities. Stories, by the wholeness and coherence inherent in their very form, enable us to perceive and relate patterns of meaning and value in our lives. It is through the telling and hearing of stories that our relationships develop and our identity as individuals within community is possible. A discussion of storytelling is taking place in many fields at the present time That we are so concerned with storytelling may indicate that we have lost the ability to tell our story and that we realize stones are a necessary way of giving order and meaning to our lives. Perhaps our experience of the stories of literature can help us to recover this ability. They may serve as a bridge to reconnect us with the sacred stories that integrate all aspects of our lives. There are a number of recent novels and poems that are concerned, both structurally and thematically, with the telling of stories. Perhaps by entering into dialogue with these stories about telling stories we may learn again to live imaginatively and to hear and share in the story of another. If we lose the ability to tell the story of our lives, we will have lost our ability to stand in relation to either our fellow human beings or the sacred. And we will be left with silence.",

At work, we bargain with clients about the terms of a contract; we bargain with our boss about a pay rise when the contract is signed. At home, we bargain with our partners about who will tidy the house; we bargain with our children about how many stories they can read before bed. And politicians, of course, routinely bargain in situations that have life or death consequences. The purpose of negotiation is to reach an agreement, and in particular, agreement in the presence of conflicting goals and preferences. If your preferences, goals, and aspirations were completely aligned with mine, then there would be no conflict, and hence there would be no need for negotiation. In this case, the best outcome for me would also be the best outcome for you, and so we could simply determine such an outcome, and then implement it. Neither of us would have any incentive other than to find such a mutually optimal best outcome – our joint problem is nothing more than an optimisation problem. Unfortunately, of course, the real world is not like that. More often than not, people have very different goals and preferences, and when this occurs, some method is required to find an outcome that will be acceptable to all concerned. Negotiation provides such a mechanism.",

Perhaps such an activism begins with an inquiry into knowledge that asks: How do we know about each other? or How do we know about our world? An activism that worries our pat assurances of such knowledge might then proceed to an understanding that most of what we know comes to us through various forms of representational knowledge, be it media, history and other discourses or even our own immediate perceptions. Given that these forms are predicated upon a stable relationship between the person trying to know and the object of understanding, our activism of open-mindedness would then run into the obsessive need for recognition in our world; that is, in the moment of recognition the individual finds a tremendous comfort and reassurance in the self-sameness of identity or in the familiarity of the object. Thus, the forms in which we perceive the world are a problem to an activism of open-mindedness insofar as they are often designed to furnish a sense of security, the comfort of recognition, and a sense of self-sameness between an individual and the world.",

      "abstract": "Every day we work hard to motivate ourselves. We spend much of our time trying to motivate the people working for us, with us and in business with us. In our personal lives we try to motivate our friends, partners and children. From the economic point of view, motivation is based on a very simple trade-off: we need and want things, and we work to get them. We're more likely to do something if we get money for it, and the more money we get, the more motivated we are. But what if our understanding of motivation and money is all wrong? In Payoff, Dan Ariely investigates the true nature of motivation and our partial blindness to the way it works. He digs to the root of money motivation, and explains how understanding it can help us to successfully approach different choices in our lives. Along the way, Ariely explores complex questions like: * Why are we willing to part with money on some occasions and not others? * Should we motivate children to do chores by giving them money? * Is there any correlation between performance efficiency and pay? * What are the taboos surrounding money and should they be challenged? We often, mistakenly, think that our motivations are simple and one dimensional. But motivations are about the essence of what pushes us forward, what make us human. Payoff explores the complex motivations that drive us, giving insight into what we really want in life and what we can do to get and give more of it more often.",

Moreover, everyone remains incredibly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic threats like climate change and pandemics. So, some may deny we should try to help people live minimally well because doing so seems hopeless. Others may worry that, in trying to help others, we will risk our own ability to live well enough. How we should respond to such apparent tragedy? This chapter argues that by cultivating a new virtue that I call creative resolve we can help many people live at least minimally good lives. This virtue requires us to try hard to come up with new ways of helping people live good (enough) lives. Although creative resolve does not appear on canonical lists of the virtues, it can help us overcome apparent tragedy and ensure that people everywhere flourish.",

The tragic perspective discourages a focus on minimal, incremental improvements, instead encouraging reflection on the conflicted aims and values inherent in any educational activity. The tragic sense is the point of tension between seeing the necessity of things as they are and the persistent imagining of them turning out otherwise. The tragic sense depends on this dual perspective—of seeing at the same time the possibilities and the limits, the gains and the costs, the hopes and the disappointments, of any human endeavor. The tragic sense helps us maintain a humble respect for experiences and accept them as a condition of life rather than as something to be transcended, avoided, or explained away.",

This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "Offensive Beneficence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Simple acts of kindness that are performed sincerely and with evident goodwill can also, paradoxically, be perceived as deeply insulting by the people who are benefited. When a person is moved to help someone out of genuine concern for her, when he has no intention to embarrass her, and when he succeeds at benefiting her, how can his generosity be demeaning to her? Yet, people sometimes find themselves brusquely refusing assistance from others while trying to show that they do not need their charity. People with disabilities often find themselves in situations of this sort, where they bristle at others who rush to open doors for them, while their kind-hearted benefactors are surprised and hurt by the cold reception they receive. The aim of this chapter is to explain how well-intentioned and effective beneficence can be offensive, with special emphasis on cases in which someone assists a disabled person.",

      "abstract": "One cause of social unrest is the constant acquaintance of people with themselves; an acquaintance which seldom becomes true knowledge. There is no escape from people. They are a continuous pressure on each would‐be individual, a continuous threat to his space, his property, his life, his freedom. They also demand the same resources as he needs and they tend to waste them in as prodigal a fashion. All the deadly sins are more venomous in a massive population; that is what the old opposition of town and country has meant, since the Reformation, and what the rising crime rate in big cities means today. A massive population will despair; it will be acutely self‐conscious; it will feel the demands of the senses intensely; it will anxiously yearn for ever more food; it will give up toil and strive to divert itself; it will want to be more like that other person whom its members come up against as a fellow competitor, but regard only as an object to be absorbed; it will live in anger and by anger. The more man is pent in conurbations, the less he can be himself, because he cannot easily lose himself. His over‐acquaintance with himself and his needs breeds the self‐disgust which can become hatred and cruelty turned upon himself. The new towns offer hopeful alternatives, but there is little sign that they are being deliberately chosen. Some correction is needful.",

      "title": "Honoring “Alone Time”",
      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "Cruel Optimism: On Marx, Loss and the Senses",
      "abstract": "OPTIMISM AND ITS OBJECTS When we talk about an object of desire, we are really talking about a cluster of promises we want someone or something to make to us and make possible for us. This cluster of promises could be embedded in a person, a thing, an institution, a text, a norm, a bunch of cells, smells, a good idea--whatever. To phrase 'the object of desire' as a cluster of promises is to allow us to encounter what's incoherent or enigmatic in our attachments, not as confirmation of our irrationality but as an explanation for our sense of our endurance in the object, insofar as proximity to the object means proximity to the cluster of things that the object promises, some of which may be clear to us while others not so much. In other words, all attachments are optimistic. That does not mean that they all feel optimistic: one might dread, for example, returning to a scene of hunger or longing or the slapstick reiteration of a lover or parent's typical misrecognition. But the surrender to the return to the scene where the object hovers in its potentialities is the operation of optimism as an affective form. In optimism, the subject leans toward promises contained within the present moment of the encounter with their object. (1) 'Cruel optimism' names a relation of attachment to compromised conditions of possibility whose realisation is discovered either to be impossible, sheer fantasy, or too possible, and toxic. What's cruel about these attachments, and not merely inconvenient or tragic, is that the subjects who have x in their lives might not well endure the loss of their object or scene of desire, even though its presence threatens their well-being, because whatever the content of the attachment is, the continuity of the form of it provides something of the continuity of the subject's sense of what it means to keep on living on and to look forward to being in the world. This phrase points to a condition different than that of melancholia, which is enacted in the subject's desire to temporise an experience of the loss of an object/scene with which she has identified her ego continuity. Cruel optimism is the condition of maintaining an attachment to a problematic object. One more thing: the cruelty of an optimistic attachment is, I think, usually something an analyst observes about someone's or some group's attachment to x, since usually that attachment exists without being an event, or even better, seems to lighten the load for someone/some group. (2) But if the cruelty of an attachment is experienced by someone/some group, even in disavowed fashion, the fear is that the loss of the object/scene of promising itself will defeat the capacity to have any hope about anything. Often this fear of loss of a scene of optimism as such is unstated and only experienced in a sudden incapacity to manage startling situations, as we will see below. One might point out that all objects/scenes of desire are problematic, in that investments in them and projections onto them are less about them than about what cluster of desires and affects we can manage to keep magnetised to them. I have indeed wondered whether all optimism is cruel, because the experience of loss of the conditions of its reproduction can be so breathtakingly bad, just as the threat of the loss of x in the scope of one's attachment drives can feel like a threat to living on itself. But some scenes of optimism are clearly crueller than others: where cruel optimism operates, the very vitalising or animating potency of an object/ scene of desire contributes to the attrition of the very thriving that is supposed to be made possible in the work of attachment in the first place. This might point to something as banal as a scouring love, but it also opens out to obsessive appetites, working for a living, patriotism, all kinds of things. One makes affective bargains about the costliness of one's attachments, usually unconscious ones, most of which keep one in proximity to the scene of desire/attrition. …",

Think of people who do not want to discuss their personal dissatisfactions or concerns, and instead simply resort to dealing with those negative feelings by reading books or watching television. Scholarly and political emphases on consciousness, liberal agency, and speech acts have made it difficult to formulate theories about one’s desire to break free from one’s identity, and from the familial, social, political, and historical duties associated with it. Our culture of confession and openness also ignores the wishes of those who want to remain silent and private. By analyzing various moments and scenes of reading in literary works and in real-life examples, I can begin to speculate about a humanism based on silence, vicariousness, and suspended agency.",

In any society, it is inevitable that these interests shall come into conflict. The gaming community calls people who promote conflict 'griefers'. Griefers are people who like nothing better than to kill team-mates or obstruct the game's objectives. Griefers scam, cheat and abuse, often victimising the weakest and newest players. In games that attempt to encourage complex and enduring interactions among thousands of players, 'griefing' has evolved from being an isolated nuisance to a social disease.",

In the style of adaptation I call Rupture, a person bears the full brunt of HIV’s despair and trauma. For these men, grief is too weighty to be countered by hope. Sorrow may cut too deep to allow for stability, much less growth. Here loss, not growth, is key. Gone is the comfort of a safe and orderly world. Gone is the expectation of a lengthy lifespan. Gone is the soothing and helpful illusion of immortality. Gone, often, are the very lovers and friends with whom one would otherwise seek shelter from the steadily mounting losses. In one dire flash—or, more commonly, in painful, inexorable increments of loss — AIDS has robbed these men of the inner beliefs and external bonds on which they based their lives. It has unceremoniously yanked the rug of meaning out from under their feet. Rupture results from losing your prior framework for understanding the world, with no new beliefs to take their place. Victor and Ron are examples of this style of adaptation.",

However, few of us are lucky enough not to feel frustrated at times when working in them. We may think the policies mistaken and the rules and regulations irritatingly inappropriate for our work. We may have to wait too long for a decision and not like it when it is made. We may find some of those with whom we must work uncongenial, inefficient, obstructive and sometimes even malign.

Harassment or undermining behaviour can be more challenging to identify because it isn’t always obvious and can happen without colleagues being aware. Sometimes, it isn’t even apparent to those who experience it, until an event means the problem becomes overwhelming. In fact, many people who experience undermining at work perceive the problem as their own and this can have a far more insidious impact on well-being, professional performance and mental health.",

      "title": "Understanding Fear Using My Sociological Imagination",
      "abstract": "I. Introduction Since I can remember, nearly every aspect and event of my life, whether good or bad, has been characterized by the sense of being driven. This, it seems, is a fairly common phenomenon. People everywhere desire and do things, set goals and achieve them, being driven by some force such as success, happiness, or wealth. In my case, however, what has been driving me both towards and away from the things I hope to accomplish, the choices I have made, and the goals I set for the future, is fear. It seems that into whichever area of my life I choose to delve, what I find is an underlying characteristic of fear defining my feelings, choices, motives, actions, and aspirations. As to the origins of this fear, it is easy for me to pinpoint why some areas of my life would have such a fearful emotional charge. However, I continue to struggle with understanding why this fear has seeped and bled into other unrelated aspects of my life. Likewise, I also have yet to figure out how this undertone of negativity could be eradicated from my decision making and goal setting processes completely. In early childhood, from what I remember and what my mother has shared, I was scared of quite a few things. My father being a firefighter, I was scared of the house burning with me trapped inside. Because he was an alcoholic and unemotional, I was scared of him. In a correlative sense, I assumed that he would be unable or unwilling to save me as our house potentially burned to the ground. I was scared of death, and losing my parents, as I think most children probably are. My house was tall, old, and creepy, reminding me of The Addams Family home. Lastly, I was scared of spiders (and anything with more than four legs, for that matter). As I grew older and life became more complex, so did my fear. At the age of 14, I was sexually assaulted outside of my home and my life was threatened at my ever speaking of what happened. Immediately I was confronted by a fear and lack of trust for any other person. At first, I did as I was told and kept the secret. As my thoughts began to boil and fester in my memory and imagination, the fear began to turn onto my self. I felt as if I had betrayed my self-concept and my own body to the extent that I could no longer trust myself, and therefore was someone to be feared. I knew I needed help for what had happened to me, but was afraid to tell anyone, fearing that the man who hurt me would come back and rape me again, or worse yet, kill me. I was also fearful that no one would believe me or that I might even be to blame for what happened. I began cutting myself to such an extent that someone would notice and reach out to me. More than once I also drank hard liquor because I knew it would make my blood thinner, thus potentially killing me and in turn putting an end to my fear. I now realize that this was also a method I had used to get in touch with my own emotions; the hurt I inflicted on my body both brought to mind and simultaneously numbed out the emotional turmoil. It had the ability to both distract me from my fear if it became debilitating and allow me to feel something if suppressing the memories left me void of all emotion. Eventually my self-destruction paid off, and my cousin noticed and brought me to the hospital. My parents were called and I was admitted to a private hospital for overnight observation. It was here, in the temporary feeling of sanctuary that the hospital gave, that I first told someone what had happened to me. I began getting treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression linked to the incident, yet I still refused to give the identity of the man who hurt me. Over the years, I have for the most part resolved and recovered from my PTSD. I have not had a flashback in over two years and have relinquished much of my fear of other people, my self, and my perpetrator. However, it seems that to a large extent, the fear I experience in my day to day life is a lingering effect of both my trauma and my childhood with an alcoholic parent. …",

      "title": "My Personal, Professional, and Academic Journey and Lived Experience with Domestic Violence",
      "abstract": "Regardless of its definition or perception, intimate partner, domestic, or family violence is a crime and remains a societal scourge around the world. Some people grow up in loving, stable homes while others are raised in an environment filled with violence, rage, fear, dysfunction, and toxicity. In the household I was raised in, discipline always came in the form of verbal and physical violence which was considered \"the norm.\" My personal development from infancy and into early adulthood was chaotic and destructive and I had no positive male role model in my life. I became needy, insecure, nihilistic, and angry with everyone and everything around me; I constantly failed in my own intimate and personal relationships. Academically, I was a below average student; professionally, I was undereducated with no advancement potential and I faced a life of perpetual failure. Now, upon reflection, I am convinced that my lived experience with domestic violence very nearly doomed me a cycle of failure. When I became a police officer, I used my personal experience with domestic violence to empathize with the victim; to be her champion. My goal was to become that officer who understood domestic violence, to bring her abuser to justice, and free her from being constantly abused. Later in my policing career, I wanted to transfer that personal and professional knowledge into a doctoral study and become a respected scholar/practitioner.",

      "title": "9 Steps Towards Giving New Meaning to Life",
      "abstract": "As a practical clinician in psychology for many years, I have accompanied and supported numerous patients in their Gestalt therapy. Together we discovered that the significance they had given to occurrences in their lives kept them in many ways prisoners of judgment, guilt and shame and painful loneliness. This articles proposes to share the nine phases of a courageous journey from incomprehension and confusion, to acceptance of themselves as they are, enabling them to step out of their solitude. Initially, the patient discovers that their usual schemas do not allow them to cope with an unexpected or difficult experience or situation. They are confused, and running a loop in their mind. They reach out to find some understanding. They are not conscious of what is happening to them nor or they curious about it. They are in a place of suffering, vulnerability, loneliness, shame and guilt. They only know their desire to experience more joy and beauty. By creating space for an initial, internal movement I gently and firmly support the patient in the exploration of unresolved occurrences in their life, examining how these relate to current situations. They start to learn how to know themself and identify their core values, strengths and limitations. After this essential internal movement the next step is to restore life and movement: I create a relation based on listening, acceptance and sustenance that allows them to gain self-confidence as they examine the significance of their schemas. As they start to free themself from their feelings and choices, they can also start to take position. Next is a very lonely and difficult phase where the patient opens up to moving forward into new and unknown possibilities in life, whilst accepting that they can not undo the past. I bring special attention to understanding how they have constructed themself, how they have given meaning to their life. In this crucial stage for the patient I hold space with benevolence and respect, helping them to accept their vulnerability without judgement. They are identifying more clearly with their authentic self, able to recognise their legitimacy. Finally the patient is ready to confront reality, to test their new competencies and to integrate their new understandings. By giving new meaning to their life, they gain an astounding new sense of freedom and peace.",

      "title": "Rectification and remainders",
      "abstract": "Forgiveness, mercy and gratitude are rectifications, attempts to correct imbalances or set things right between us. Guilt is a moral remainder, a residue acknowledging an unexpiated wrong. Remainders offer us a limited redemption in revealing our appreciation that not everything has been made right. Forgiveness manifests compassion for wrongdoers, who may or may not deserve it. Questions arise about when, what and whom we can forgive, what forgiving achieves, and when we ought or ought not to forgive. Forgiveness has special value in personal relationships, enabling their renewal. Connections among punishment, repentance, forgiveness and regret (another remainder) are complex, sometimes paradoxical. Mercy often manifests forgiveness, as in pardons and amnesties. Yet we can also show mercy in administering rules where there has been no wrong. Is mercy unjust? Answers vary according to whether the case resembles a criminal offence or a civil suit. Grounded in others’ sufferings rather than their deeds, mercy has us see ourselves in them, but the value of doing so can be qualified by considerations of justice and of self-respect. Mercy and forgiveness sometimes evoke gratitude, appreciative acknowledgement of another’s goodwill. Gratitude can be deserved or misplaced. Debts of gratitude are paradoxical, giving rise to ethical questions. When do we owe more than emotional response? What does reciprocity require between unequals? Some paradoxes may be solved by understanding obligations of gratitude as like those of a trustee rather than those of a debtor. Guilt is emotional self-punishment (often relievable by forgiveness) which continues even after compensation, restitution or punishment by others. Questions arise about when it is rational and how it is related to shame, remorse, regret and repentance, which are also remainders.",

      "title": "Simmering and Swooping: Creative Steps Before Writing",
      "abstract": "Some authors find they need to let their ideas “simmer” before writing, while others find they have to “swoop ” around the office before they are ready to write. You are likely to find that you use one or both techniques to organize your ideas or work area before a successful writing session. Every serious writer has experienced periods when the creative flow abruptly halts. No ideas come forth or, at least, none that seem worth expressing and confidence plunges. An initial reluctance to sit down at the desk or word processor and write quickly develops into something akin to aversion. The wall between writer and words grows higher and thicker. It seems as if there is no hope for salvaging the situation. The run of words has ended. The usual advice to writers caught in this downward spiral is to write through the block, and this works, usually. The discipline of putting pen to paper—or fingers to keyboard—somehow puts a crack in the wall, which eventually tumbles down as the writer moves more and more confidently into the writing. All is well; the crisis has passed. However, writers experience other sensations related to their work. One such sensation is “simmering”; the other is “swooping.” They are both essential steps in preparing for the creative task of writing. See if these are familiar to you. “Simmering” is signaled by an intense compulsion to do whatever task the writer usually avoids most vigorously. Deferred spring Cleaning and hand-waxing the family car come immediately to mind, as do sorting through drawers that have languished for months or tackling the stack of ironing that threatens to topple at any moment. For outdoor people, weeding a neglected garden or clearing out the garage become essential tasks that must be accomplished immediately. It seems that anything and everything is competing for the writer's attention, but a careful examination of these compulsions reveals their commonality: all involve repetitive, physical labor that is relatively (but not entirely) mindless. A certain degree of attention to the task is called for, but the mind is free to wander while the hands work through the job. During this simmering, creative ideas often surface. Some writers report a simmering experience that precedes any substantial writing chore. For most writers, however, the compulsions associated with “simmering” tend to arise in the midst of a serious writing project. The groundwork has been laid, and the project usually is off to a good start. The writer has a sense of the next steps to be accomplished, as well as a feel for how the work might be shaped. It's just a matter of sitting down to do the writing. Then the simmering sets in. Now a normal person would simply despair, and the writer's usual response is an audible groan and a stoic effort to push off the compulsion and get back to the work of writing. But the attentive writer who has given in to the urge to clean or iron or weed will find that there is, rippling on the edges of a daydream, the unfolding of the perfect solution to the work in progress. Like a pot of soup over the low flame on the back burner of the kitchen stove, creativity needs time to simmer in order for the flavors to blend and the richness of the broth to develop. Rush into the writing task, and the ephemeral process of creativity—once interrupted—will retreat, again eluding consciousness. Allow it to simmer as you complete your compulsive organizing, and your return to the desk will be rewarded with a resumption of the creative flow. “Swooping” is another matter. This phenomenon is more frequently encountered at the start of a new project. Unlike “simmering,” which takes the writer away from the desk or computer, “swooping” involves work-area habits. The research is done; the outline established. Notes are carefully organized in a file folder; reference works are near at hand. The desk is cleared of clutter and one sits down to begin. Ah, but first a fine point is needed on each of those pencils arrayed so neatly in their special jug. Align the note pads on the desktop, and place extras within easy reach. Adjust the brightness of the computer screen. Load a new stack of paper in the printer and replace the ink cartridge. Pour a cup of coffee. Settle in. Ah, one moment, please! Adjust the lighting just so, crack the window for a gentle breeze. Step back a moment, and you will notice that you have completed a series of ever-tightening, concentric approaches to your writing place—very much like a bird, swooping in on its prey—as you prepare to alight upon the project. Interrupt the process, and you are doomed to failure. Allow the simmering and swooping to proceed, and you and your writing will soon fall into place and the creative work of writing will truly begin. Andrea B.

      "title": "When love and abuse are not mutually exclusive: the need for government intervention.",
      "abstract": "All of us remember times in our lives when we were convinced, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that our parents did not have our best interests at heart. Whether their obvious dislike for us was manifested by their insistence on our doing our homework, taking responsibility for our actions, or, as my parents did to me, forcing us to eat squash casserole, it usually became apparent that they did not do what they did for the purpose of torturing us (with the exception of the squash casserole). Rather than methods of well-deserved vengeance, the actions of parents, no matter how painful they may appear to be, are generally appropriate, well measured, and entered into with a firm resolve to help their children become better people. Where the crisis develops is when parents act in a manner that does not benefit their children--where the end result of the act is a form of abuse, emotional, mental, or physical. Certain types of abuse are obvious--e.g., the child who is scalded with boiling water for failing to behave; the little girl who is constantly reminded by her parents that she is dumb, won't amount to anything, and have never been born. Other types of abuse are more difficult to distinguish. Sometimes what would in normal circumstances be abuse is not abuse at all. For example, many people view death as preferable to a vegetative existence, one where the individual is unable to interact with the world around him due to a lack of consciousness. These people believe that the withholding of medical care under these circumstances is not neglect or abuse, but the most loving thing that can be done. There is generally very little controversy when an adult makes this decision for himself before being rendered unconscious or incompetent. However, when others make this decision for an incompetent individual without any knowledge or understanding of what she would want, concern arises over whether the proper decision is being made. Similarly, when parents make decisions regarding medical treatment for a child which will result in that child's death, a question arises of whether the parents are acting in their child's best interests or if the action constitutes abuse. This area, an area where the line between love and abuse, best interests and neglect, becomes dangerously blurred, is what will be discussed here. Inherent to this discussion are questions regarding fitness, decisionmaking, and authority. What does it take to be fit to decide these issues? Is love enough? How are these decisions to be made, and who should be consulted when making them? Finally, who should be able to make these decisions? This article attempts to answer these questions primarily in the context alluded to above--the situation wherein a parent is left with two choices for the child--to treat or not to treat. In order to reach this analysis, however, the basics of medical decisionmaking, autonomy, and consent must be addressed. Informed Consent and the Basics of Medical Decisionmaking The doctrine of informed consent, a long-held precept of the law grounded in the belief that competent adults have the right to make medical decisions for themselves, requires a doctor to explain to a patient all of his options and the possible repercussions of the option the patient chooses.(1) One of the first expressions of this sentiment came more than one hundred years ago in Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford. In Botsford, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that no one could be compelled to undergo an invasive medical procedure without his or her prior consent. The Court declared: No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.(2) Twenty years after Botsford, Justice Cardozo addressed this issue while he sat on the New York Court of Appeals in Schloendorff v. …",

Keep it real, be true to yourself, be your own person, find yourself, express yourself, be confident in yourself, have self-esteem, follow your own path, and so on. On the one hand, this guidance seems completely natural: are we not all trying our best to be ourselves? Yet, on the other hand, the directive, be yourself, sometimes sounds strangely hollow: after all, who else could I possibly be but myself? Of course, everyone is familiar with the many ways in which we fail to be ourselves. We all know the pressures and impulses to conform, to mask, to deny ourselves. We say what we think others want us to say; we act the way others want us to act. We lie to ourselves, betray ourselves, forget ourselves, let ourselves down, and neglect ourselves. On top of all this we live at a time of rapidly advancing technologies for the chemical manipulation of moods and the genetic engineering of physical and mental traits. Faced with the capacity to transform one's mood, memory, longevity, or sexuality through chemical or genetic manipulation, what could it possibly mean to \"just be yourself\"?",

      "title": "Know your value",
      "abstract": "Q As a nurse manager, I often feel undervalued. Is it the position or my working environment? My gut reaction is that feeling undervalued is most likely due to your work environment, but you may have to look to yourself for the answers because there are many factors involved. Sometimes we get into a slump and feel unhappy or deenergized, and it has more to do with our own feelings and expectations than job reality. There are always portions of the job we don't like, but most of the time we tolerate these because we get fulfillment from the enjoyable majority of the work. What makes us feel valued is both internal and external. Are you recognized privately and publicly for your contributions? Just as our staff members need recognition and appreciation, so do we. Are you learning new skills and competencies? If not, you can work with your boss to create a development plan and volunteer for projects and activities out of your comfort zone. Do you feel included in decision making? If not, that can be the result of organizational culture, your nurse executive's leadership style, or even your own competence or engagement level. Do you enjoy working with your team? Sometimes a few “bad apples” on the team can ruin the work environment. Confront it and get help to manage any problems. Does the culture of your organization appreciate nursing's influence on success? If not, that's an impediment to feeling valued and not something you can change single-handedly.FigureConcentrate on what brings you joy and relish it. The position you hold is one of the most important leadership roles in the healthcare setting. You can contribute and facilitate improvements to unit culture, processes, and outcomes. You make or break the work environment for your staff and the interdisciplinary team. Your management and leadership make an enormous difference to patients and families. Staff members will grow and flourish as a result of your influence. Focus on what you can control. Some of my own sense of value comes from patients and staff at the point of care—listening, helping, appreciating, removing barriers, and engaging them. That's the point where you intersect every day. If there's no joy in your work despite addressing the issues you can identify and fix, then it's time to move on. The role is far too important, and so is your happiness. Q I just finished my master's degree in nursing administration. To remain current, do I need to go right back to school for a doctor of nursing practice (DNP) degree? You're very ambitious! You don't necessarily need a DNP to stay current because there are other approaches to keeping abreast in nursing administration. Reading journals, attending conferences, joining collaboratives, and networking with fellow nurse leaders are just a few. However, you'll want to further your education if your career goals require a nursing doctorate, if you're committed to having the highest nursing academic credential, if you desire advanced leadership skills, or if you simply love the continuous pursuit of knowledge. The DNP is a practice doctorate, distinct from a PhD or doctor of nursing science, which are research degrees. It's akin to any other practice doctorate in healthcare, such as medicine, physical therapy, or pharmacology. Check your state rules because not all states permit a nursing executive DNP. For example, my state (New York) only permits DNP programs in advanced clinical practice for NPs. The DNP curriculum essentials include systems thinking, analytics, healthcare policy, interprofessional collaboration, population health, information technology, and more. These fundamentals of DNP education will, of course, make you a more forward-thinking nurse leader and prepare you to have greater impact in your current role and advanced roles in the future. You may be able to use a DNP to fulfill requirements in the faculty realm if you're teaching nursing practice in your specialty. I admire your energy. At an overall level, the nursing profession continues to have limited academic credentialing; however, motivated leaders such as you will help push us into a new era.",

      "title": "Over the Long Haul: Burnout and Hope in a Conservative Era",
      "abstract": "These days, my conversations with friends often touch on topic of burnout. Women who have been working for years in women's movement, or working as feminists in other progressive causes, talk about being tired and discouraged, even despairing. Occasionally, a longtime feminist will explode in anger, indicting movement for its failure to help her or to speak to women in general. Doubt, as well as depression, often follows her anger: Is she right? Is it useless? Was it ever any use after all? Discouragement and doubt exist, but they are not antifeminist. They are integral parts of a women's movement (or any other social movement) that seeks to make world a better place, a possible place for us to live. Discouragement and doubt do not in themselves spell the end of women's movement. Unlike apathy, which indicates that we have given up and closed off our feelings, discouragement and doubt suggest that we are still struggling-struggling in a conservative environment that often defeats us. Such defeats, however, do not automatically lead to discouragement. We become disheartened and weary for a complex of reasons, including our individual biographies (such as how long we have worked in movement; state of our health; degree of our personal responsibilities toward others), and what part of movement we have identified with (what particular issue; what ideological strain; what region or city; what class or racial or ethnic group). Moreover, discouragement we feel at any given moment in our individual lives does not necessarily reflect movement as a whole. A recent presentation I attended suggested how we sometimes read movement's history from our individual histories. At this gathering, a feminist scholar and activist spent a great deal of time talking about weariness she felt because her particular work, and that of women with whom she struggled, had not in fact changed world. For her, movement in its glory was over. As she spoke, I thought back to a similar event, some ten years ago, when I was becoming more active as a feminist. A friend had offered to take me to a meeting at which women involved in late 1960's and early seventies were discussing movement's current politics. I was thrilled with opportunity to join them: I was ready to fly, and these experienced women would help give me direction. But instead, their talk filled me with dismay. The women's movement, they said, was over. It had been betrayed in this way and coopted in that way. There was nothing left worth working for. I was dismayed, but luckily I did not take them at their word. I recognized that they were burned out (I don't know if term was yet current), but I also sensed that they were wrong. Similarly, I felt that activist I listened to at this recent gathering had blurred distinction between her own discouragement and possibility that her work would inspire and support work of others. In fact, it inspired and supported me. Out of my own weariness, I had gone to this presentation for nourishment. Her work was new to me-another source of energy, another way to fly. With this important qualification-that we must not assume that our discouragement or weariness speaks for everyone-we still sorely need to look at what such feel-",

If you hadst said, 'Love', I would have given thee that thou didst ask for; and I would have gone from thee, and returned to thee no more. But now, the day will come when I shall return. In that day I shall bear both gifts in one hand (Schreiner, 1890, pp. 99-100). Does Schreiner mean that with Freedom as the choice, Love is possible as well, while with Love only, there is a danger of losing Freedom? I am intrigued with such a proposal and tend to think that in health-care and nursing ethics, as in Life, we need both of Life's gifts. We need both freedom and love. We need the individual freedom to make decisions and choices for ourselves, and we need love and compassion for others within a community.",

      "abstract": "At certain point in our life, we often face difficulties in behaving ourselves in an\r\nunfamiliar society. Furthermore, we face these difficulties to stand alone without our\r\nfamily, to live our life, and to make decisions ourselves. There are also certain points in\r\nour life where we are left with no choice but to keep secrets that we must not tell any\r\nliving soul among us. Being a grown up person means that we are able to live the\r\nchoices we made, and sometimes the choices we made lead us to a risk that can even\r\nmake our lives changed and reversed. Veronica Roth’s Divergent brought up the issues\r\nof a 16 year old girl whose life is about to change through the choices she make as she\r\ndefine her identity in the society she lives in. This study examines on how Beatrice –the\r\nprotagonist— who is different than any other teenagers at her age, making a big\r\ndecision as she begins to live her life as a grown up child and as a person whose\r\nlifestyle represents certain part of the society she chooses to be in. New Criticism\r\napproach is considered as the appropriate theory to be applied to examine the main\r\nfocus of this study; to reveal on what the conflict that arises from the choices she made\r\nare and how each choices lead her to certain side of life that she never got a chance to\r\nlearn and understand.",

      "abstract": "There are individuals who speak to us in such a way that they call up confidence and conviction in our own process of becoming a whole integrated person. We feel that their expectations of us presuppose our own capabilities and growth and they let us be ourselves, even while they instruct, guide, or explain. We feel free to be ourselves in their presence because they do not need to see us as different than we are. We feel built up through ourselves in their presence and many new things are possible for us to act on. They seem to have a way of focusing their speaking and listening so that their abilities and qualities are not an imposition. In the qualities and abilities belonging to each of us we are for ourselves; then there is something else that we have for one another — that is the work of love. Self‐renunciation means that we make it unnecessary to project Our wisdom, experience and understanding on the other self, so that the other self shines through the opening.

      "abstract": "FigureFigureHow do you talk to the important people in your life who don't work in emergency medicine? The people around you and closest to you—your family, partners, and friends—matter deeply. You care about them, and they probably want to talk with you about what's going on in your life and work, but they don't live in your world. They don't speak emergency medicine. Translating across that gap, especially after working the 10th hard shift in a row or facing a significant tragedy, is challenging and at times can feel impossible. But communication is a skill, and thankfully it's one that we can get better at with practice. Allow for Hot Takes It takes time to process what happens on shift. If you come home filled with anger, sorrow, and tragedy after working a trauma and say, “I can't do this anymore,” that's OK. You might really feel that. But that might not be true in 10 minutes, and that's OK too. Give yourself the space to have a hot take, revise your thinking, and not have the first thing you talk about after a shift be a final answer. Of course, you have to do this in moderation. Yelling at your partner (or boss) is not a good idea, even if you are coming home hot. Try to sit with an idea or feeling to see if it dissolves or maybe transitions into something more useful. I find it helpful to say what I'm feeling out loud to myself. I'll ask myself some version of “is this a real feeling or is this because of x?” If I'm in a high-risk zone, like after a night shift, I'll ask myself that question two or three times or ask it again after sleep, coffee, or a workout. If you are going to talk with someone about a hot feeling after a shift, try to be honest and clear about it. Try saying something like, “Hey, I'm not sure this is a real signal or not, but I'd like to talk about it. Can we explore this together?” Use Bumpers Bumpers are systems that prevent you from going too far off course, like the ones in a bowling lane. Put them in place ahead of time where you think you might struggle, and they will help you steer yourself back in the right direction. A great way to start with bumpers is to identify types of conversations with which you tend to struggle. Think you'll wrestle to make complex logistics decisions immediately after coming home from a shift? Use a bumper to guide you: “I'm sorry. This is a type of decision I might have trouble making right now. Can we revisit it in 15 minutes?” Worry you won't be able to connect to a story your important people tell you about their day because it's not as viscerally intense as what you typically go through? Set up a bumper for yourself: When you hear them start a story, tell yourself to drop in and listen or take a few deep breaths as a focusing, quiet reminder. One bumper I use when I might struggle to find nuance or important shades of gray about an issue is to try hard not to talk about important or emotionally charged issues after a night shift. Boom. Bumper. The clearer you can be with what you need the better. It might seem obvious, but bumpers work best if you tell your people about them ahead of time. If they don't know, they can't help. If they do, then all of you know where the bumpers are and can use them together. Of course, there will be times when things need to happen differently, and you can and should go around a bumper. Maybe a decision absolutely must be made on something right when you get home. Maybe an emotionally intense conversation really does need to happen the morning after a night shift. That's OK. Communication is a two-way street, and all parties have needs that are important to meet. The idea is not to be rigid but to be aware of potential pitfalls and plan accordingly. Don't Pour Gas on a Fire Sometimes the best you can do in communication is not to make a bad thing worse. Especially early in training, I would sometimes come back to the normal world angry, bitter, and burned out. For other folks, it's less anger and more sorrow—they describe coming home exhausted, hopeless, and afraid. Either way, without handling your feelings and setting good boundaries, this anger or misery can bleed into interactions with your people. The thing to remember is that when you're way out there on tilt and you can't fully communicate the way you want to, just holding is a win. Choosing not to pour gas on the fire is a win. Instead of diving into a conversation, try saying, “I'm not at a place to talk right now,” or “I'm still too hot. Can I cool down more before we talk?” If that's still too much, try some structured time alone. Running and solo hikes do it for me. A meditation practice can be a great asset too. Don't expect perfection immediately. Holding still when you feel like exploding (or imploding) is a significant challenge. The best results seem to come when you're honest with your people. “I don't know how to talk about this” can be a great way to start. Remember, it's OK to be a work in progress.

      "title": "Confronting the Challenges of Conflicting World Views",
      "abstract": "The talk below was accompanied by a multimedia presentation. Confronting the challenges of conflicting world views is, perhaps, one of the challenges many of us had to face as infants: the sometimes conflicting world views of mother and father and of their families: different aims and ambitions in life, different ways to conceive progress or face problems, different attitudes towards nature, people, money, different religions, or attitudes towards the same faith, different styles, different rhythms, different tastes. So, 1 will not take the international approach but the very basic one most of us underwent at home. And those who did not feel the conflict at home must surely have felt it either in the wider circle of family and friends, or in the still wider circle of acquaintances, colleagues at work, or people at large in other regions, other countries, or even their own. I could take the example of my own family, but I will, instead, take the example of my own country, which for reasons we will not explore in detail, represents a unique case of study, since it is to the best of our knowledge the only country in the 20th century to have gone through a process of development (ranked 7th in 1900), of having come to a halt and started a deep process of underdevelopment without having been at war. How to explain such a reversal? Several years ago, and long before the last and most terrible crisis of December 2001 started, 1 said at the general semantics conference at Hofstra University in New York that Argentina was the best example I knew of non-general semantics at work. Events have unfortunately proven me right, and you may have witnessed some scenes of deep poverty and violent riots some time ago on your television screens. Here I would like to show part of a multimedia to visually offer some data about Argentina and the present crisis with emphasis on some of the cultural aspects (or non-GS mechanisms) that might have led to the present terminal crisis, such as the either-or mentality, stereotyping, identification, allness, double binds, etc. The violence of this crisis, with the abnormal child mortality rate (due to malnutrition) for a country famous for the richness of its soil, made many Argentines fmally(!) react. And there began to appear some positive signs: incredible increase in solidarity rates, in people's participation and involvement in community affairs, etc. Some of the good signs the argentine society showed in the last twelve months are timidly showing our need to build bridges, to change some of our thinking patterns, to change our maps of the world. To favor and strengthen these courses of action, we provided from EVOLUCION some seminars along the year 2002 which we called Tools for a New Society (mostly based on general semantics formulations). …",

      "abstract": "In this paper I explore how we ought to respond to the problematic inner lives of those that we love. I argue for an understanding of love that is radical and challenging—a powerful form of resistance within the confines of everyday relationships. I argue that love, far from the platitudinous and saccharine view, does not call for our acceptance of others’ failings. Instead, loving another means believing in their potential to grow and holding them to account when they fail. I argue that loving others means meeting them where they are and working to understand the role that oppressive ideologies, coupled with cognitive biases, play in generating and entrenching their problematic mental states. I then argue that we ought not disengage with our loved ones or write them off as lost causes, nor should we accept that we will simply “agree to disagree.” Instead, we should stand in moral solidarity with our loved ones and press them to become better while simultaneously understanding that such moral growth is usually a slow and painful process—often, the project of a lifetime.",

We find meaning in experiences, because through experiences we have contributed to the worth and meaning of our lives. We also find meaning through connection. We sense that we live in service of a higher purpose. Each of us suffers uniquely because each of us is vulnerable to the shattering of a particular life pattern and the disruption of a particular life story. We are vulnerable in our connections with those who die. We are vulnerable in our intellectual and spiritual limitations. Self-respect does require a minimal self-awareness that allows us to recognize honestly when we have difficulty in meeting challenges of grieving. Self-respect requires that we seek the respectful help and support of others when we sense that we have reached the limits of our coping capacities.",

I argue that both concerns can be met by considering the role that partial forgetting of past experiences would play in the immortal life. One who loses some non‐essential memories of their past stands to be able to enjoy experiences that have grown tiresome with age. My contribution is to clarify how partial forgetting of only the non‐essential memories allays concerns about our potentially loosened connections to our earlier states. I then consider an objection to my account, that since the standards governing collective memory might be more demanding than those governing individual memory, immortal people might sacrifice aspects of their collective lives to render their own immortal lives enjoyable.",

The child who suffers insufficient or problematic contact and care internalises the parent in particular ways, sorting out and creating one-sided internal characters that represent the unsatisfactory components of his or her experiences. Fairbairn's ideas suggest that in a schizoid state, with the defences necessary to cope with painful early relationships, it is crucial to maintain a completely negative experience of some aspects of a current, real-life, loved one, so that one can keep intact an inner world of compartmentalised, one-sided inner objects. Paradoxically, the liveliest and potentially expansive indications of emotional truth in couple relationships are just these expressions of experiencing the other in rigid, unrealistically one-sided, ways, and the fierce clinging to these one-dimensional views.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Much of our lives is spent experiencing our journey in pursuit of goals. Indeed, it can be argued that how we strive is our life. And, just as what we strive for involves shared realities with others, how we strive also involves shared realities with others. We learn from others what are the appropriate ways to pursue particular goals, just as toddlers early on learn the shared practices of their family and community. The importance of shared reality in how we go about our daily lives is evident not only in our customs or rituals but also in the strategies we choose when pursuing goals. Individuals with shared promotion goals, which is relatively common in the United States, are more likely to pursue their goals in an extroverted, eager manner. Individuals with shared prevention goals, which is relatively common in Japan, are more likely to pursue their goals in a conscientious, vigilant manner. The promotion and prevention shared realities define who we are motivationally: what counts as success or failure and its motivational significance; how we see the world (global and abstract versus local and concrete); and how we deal with the world (emphasize speed and innovative thinking versus accuracy and analytical reasoning). It even impacts when we prefer more or less risky options when making decisions: Prevention prefers the risk option that best maintains or restores the (nonloss) status quo, whereas shared promotion prefers the risk option that best allows progress beyond the (nongain) status quo.",

Do we want freedom?On first hearing, asking whether human beings want freedom seems like a silly question.Of course we want freedom!Patrick Henry's cry, \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" is a sentiment has been echoed by every succeeding generation of warriors, patriots, and resisters.But the actions of contemporary Americans (who are surely not alone in this) often belie this sentiment.Collectively, at least through our government's actions, we seek safety through greater government control over our actions and we condone human rights violations in the name of security. 1 As private individuals, we often constrain our actions or reactions in the name of getting along, not rocking the boat, or respecting tradition. 2 We accept something less than our vision of the good for ourselves or others out of selfishness, fear, peer pressure, or resignation.We seem to want freedom only if it is easy to get.What is it, then, to want freedom?First note the ambiguity with the word \"want\": Am I asking whether we lack freedom or whether we desire it?I suggest that these are related issues; lacking freedom reduces the desire for freedom, although having a desire for freedom does not guarantee a path to it.Freedom is, on the account I shall pursue here, a hard won human achievement, and desiring or valuing such freedom is an essential part of the achievement.Second, what do I mean by freedom?I will argue that we should distinguish four types of human freedom beginning with metaphysical freedom -the idea that despite living in a deterministic",

They might be employed as such – to perform the duties of a friend – or they might be consciously acquired: a pet for instance, purchased to fill a gap. This distance is reflected in some of the many meanings and etymologies of the term: ‘A person who is with another on a particular occasion, a journey’; one ‘who shares in or partakes of the work, circumstances, experience, etc., of another’.

As the historian cannot erase his knowledge of matters his subjects never knew, he renders their lives more meaningful and dramatic than they were. But then the search for, evocation, and installation of meaning in a meaningless universe is one function of the intellectual and one definition of man. I first encountered anthropology at the City College of New York in Morris Raphael Cohen's advanced course, The Philosophy of Civilization, which I took as an upper freshman in September 1937, by special dispensation of Dean Gottschall, before I had had introductory philosophy. This, the last course that Cohen gave at City before his retirement in January 1938, was a phenomenal experience, never subsequently duplicated in my education. Cohen taught from a breadth of learning in philosophy, history, science, and social science; he placed man, society, and intellectual activity in sweeping historical and cultural",

I was struck by sheer humility as I bared my scalpel on the shrivelled soles of an unnamed and unclaimed body that had once belonged to a life who had enjoyed it probably as much as anybody else. Death became more familiar as I graduated to the clinical training. Working in the busy casualty block was both physically and emotionally demanding. The elation of saving a life would soon disappear with the gloom of someone’s death. We tried out best, but still patients who might have been saved in the most ideal environment were lost. I often shed tears in the silence of night and in the comfort of loneliness when some of my patients, whom I closely knew, died. Perhaps my emotional involvement with patients was more but the tears were also an acknowledgement of the limitation experienced in my professional duty to care and cure. These limitations were organisational, financial, technical or simply due to the lack of knowledge and varied from place to place where I worked. I felt angry and upset when I had lost someone with a reversible neuromuscular failure due to the lack of appropriate ventilatory support at the right time.",

      "title": "Hurting in schools",
      "abstract": "Acknowledging the role we play in hurting can be uncomfort­able. Whether the hurt is being done by us or being done to us, we play a role in allowing it. Our words and deeds can cause hurt (and often residual anger) whether or not we intend it. Words commonly used in our homes and social groups may sound harsh and insulting to co- workers, administrators, students, and parents. To our ears, those words may sound harmless, but to others, they may feel harmful. Are we accountable for others’ reactions to our behaviors? To an extent, yes, we are. Are we responsive to acknowledg­ing our role in hurting? Likely the answer is sometimes yes, sometimes no. Schools flow with actions and reactions. We all have responsi­bilities for making the layers of communication work. When we get hurt, our reactions to the offense often make matters worse. As in a football game, we take positions of offense or defense and then choose our next play. • We evade, pretending we’re not hurt. But we carry around the unresolved resentment. And sometimes the resentment festers rather than fades. • We punish, shunning the offenders with the silent treatment. But sometimes they don’t notice. And sometimes the venge­ful thoughts hurt us more than them. • We tattle, exaggerating just enough so listeners will be as indignant as we are. • We confront the offender, yet angry accusations solve little or nothing. When we do the hurting, we may tell ourselves, “She had it com­ing” or “I’m giving him some of his own medicine.” But lower­ing ourselves to poor behavior does little to right the wrongs of being hurt. For every human encounter, even those ridden with conflict, we have choices. Shut down or open up. Connect or disconnect. Hold on or let go. Make peace or make hostility. Mend or rend. Which do we choose? Negative states of mind . . . destroy our mental happiness. Once you harbor feelings of hatred or ill feeling toward someone, once you yourself are filled by hatred or negative emotions, then other people appear to you as also hostile.",

Communication with the patient is important, since one must know what the patient knows about his disease and prognosis, what the patient wishes are or what the patient unresolved issues that cause unrest are. Once the patient is adjusted to the real expectations, professionals can help to find small goals that will bring well-being and personal satisfaction. Family and children should not be excluded from the process. Work on them is required to prevent complicated grief. The protagonist of this story may be an example of life for many people.

On stanza and strophe breaks: if a stanza is a room, the breaks between must be doorways, and who wants to sit down and rest in a doorway? The aim is to stretch the reader across the distance, leave him/her hanging and anxious to get to the next words. The same strategy, less intensely, informs line breaks as well. On punctuation or its omission: used where pacing, voice, or logic require it, but otherwise considered unnecessary. On orthography: at times because it's redundant (the words should signal beginnings and ends of thoughts regardless of capitalization); at times because capitalizing proper nouns signals an impossible surety of reference (who understands America enough to claim they're describing it completely and accurately?). Additionally, to encourage ideas to collide. On the lowercase i specifically: this isn't about autobiography, but about writing good poems. Perspective changes as the writing dictates; be wary. On voice: bifurcated, bilocated, liminal in identity (say, an ex-carney holding a one-woman picket line) and method (fragmentation; juxtaposition; ellipsis; word play).

But the object within our grasp flies quicker than we follow; when we think we have grasped it, it transforms itself and is again ahead of us … Thus we exhaust our strength, yet never reach our goal, and the nearer we are to pleasure, the further we are from happiness ... The world of reality has its bounds, the world of imagination is boundless; as we cannot enlarge the one, let us restrict the other; for all the sufferings which really make us miserable arise from the difference between the real and the imaginary.",

These themes are explored using the case study of a man who needs conflict, particularly around race and gender, in order to bypass feelings of fear. Faced with actually experiencing trauma, he finds himself running and keeps on running in order to not commit murder, first in reality and then later in his mind. Exploring the mechanisms involved when, after a difficult early life, he escapes from home as a young teenager and then finds himself unable to settle or maintain relationships. Instead, we see how moving from continent to continent, finding himself in violent conflict again and again, he is unable to resolve the conflict within himself. Using Freud's concepts of repetition compulsion, denial, and disavowal to think about this patient, I examine what is driving this internal destructiveness and the need to keep fear consistently at arm's length.",

Like, you can see they're there, but they look like they don't want to be.” He tries to elaborate, can't take it much further, but—for a 17 year old on work experience in a nursing home and wanting to be a doctor—perhaps he's done quite well already.\r\n\r\nWhere do they come from, these souls in cages? Not sure, but I see too many of them: too often and too easily we fail the souls and build the cages. In the rush and glamour of acute care, in the busy system that is designed to cure and doesn't like to lose, there are priorities that may take insufficient account of the worse-than-death outcome—the helpless, stabilised, damaged survival—that so many of us dread. And too often families are summoned for the grimly absurdist routine: “We've saved your father's life... But now he's blocking a bed.”\r\n\r\nThe sorrows can endure for months or years. The death averted is a bereavement suspended, the caged soul lingers, and people remain upset. Is it about regrets, or a strange injustice, or a wider and far more worrying dysfunction? Who knows, but it seems to happen quite a lot.\r\n\r\nYesterday my mother was well. This morning her neighbour rang me to say she was not: “She kent me, but she couldna talk, and she couldna get up.” I speak some Scots and know some neurology. It's very bad. Three hours later, in the emergency department of a decent district general hospital, I see her. Everyone has been kind and efficient, but she is now, in her grandson's words, a soul in a cage.\r\n\r\nShe was 90 in October and greatly enjoyed her birthday bash. Yesterday she logged yet another great grandchild into her fearsomely well organised birthday book, and had ordered but not yet collected her first walking stick. She had ticked all her boxes—two careers, bringing up her children, burying her husband—and since then has greatly enjoyed her bowling, her voluntary work, and a lively extended family. She cannot move her right side and cannot speak.\r\n\r\nShe is dying but she is lucky: no nasogastric tube or PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) feeding for her. A few months ago she tidied up her life, perhaps anticipating eternity, and made her wishes clear. I pass them on and a wonderful district general hospital team respects them, cares lovingly for her, and will not cage her soul.",

      "title": "Hardship and empathy",
      "abstract": "When we hear about a person’s ill fortune, the essence of good communication is for both parties to feel that they are connecting—that is, ‘on the same wavelength’. The way we act is underpinned by our attitudes and reflects our personality. Sometimes, especially when faced with unfamiliar circumstances, we are unsure of how to respond. After all, attitudes are complex, being influenced by diverse factors including life experiences, our inherent idiosyncrasies and prevalent societal values. They are therefore vulnerable to criticism when we fail to connect. With my experience of permanent paralysis from a spinal injury sustained a few years ago I have had an opportunity to reflect on these matters.\r\n\r\nOne way of responding to a person’s bad news may be to express empathy. But what is empathy all about? When is it appropriate to empathize and is this something that we can learn to do? Is empathy an innate quality or does it stem from acquired notions of how we should behave towards others? First and foremost, we need to find out how the person has been affected by events. Having gauged their perspective, we need to form our own perspective of events and, in order to empathize, feel touched by what has happened to them. This is inevitably coloured by our own previous experiences; disruptions to our own ‘normal life’ can give insight into the hardships of others. However, it is less the extent of our own hardship than how we have coped with it that affects our behaviour towards others. And, of course, we can learn much from the ways other people react to our misfortune. Those who communicate well—with that magical gift of acting comfortably and saying the right things at the right time—can teach us a great deal. So can those who get it wrong. After becoming paralysed, I was among patients who, although proceeding through a rehabilitation programme aimed at similar skills for independence, were reacting in very different ways. Some patients were deeply angry, others were resigned. Observing the responses of those around me, I could see the futility of anger and bitterness. A phase of grieving for what has been lost is unavoidable, but my own adaptation was to concentrate on the capabilities that remained. Moreover, returning to medical practice, I found myself in some ways stronger. I have learned from my own experience and those of others that growth through hardship is possible, and that the worst fate is to acquire the destructive baggage of a hard-done-by victim. People rarely come to terms with extreme hardships; they simply adapt and find different ways of living. In this process health professionals, I can testify, can provide crucial support that goes far beyond their technical skills. The key is empathy. When a person’s hardships seem beyond verbal communication, a simple acknowledgment of the inadequacy of words can be the most powerful statement of caring and support.",

It is the opposite of anxiety and emerges through a threat or danger. It is a sensory response to upcoming pain, whether seen or not. It may be accompanied by a feeling of escape or confrontation, and the degrees vary. Pain expressed by fear, awe and terror. Fear does not have a specific form, is not linked to one style or another, and does not know psychological boundaries. Fear has a role in refining the creative experience and can stimulate creativity in art. The artist's relationship with fear is complex. On the one hand, he cannot be creative without feeling afraid of something, such as fear of an angry reaction that might amount to a threat to his being and existence, or fear for his homeland from disappearing, which prompts him to work with his art to resist disappearance and confront the imminent danger. Today we live in a time of occupation, war, terrorism, persecution, discrimination, repression, violation of freedoms, censorship, instability, political, economic, social, and environmental imbalance, diseases, the epidemic, and the accumulation of information as an aspect of its manifestations.

The aim of our discussion here is to reveal various attitudes that can be taken in response to the various aspects of the change in our world heralded by somebody’s suicide. Understanding what it is to co-exist with the Other who has died allows us to show what it is to now exist with their absence. The disruption that follows is always open to our choosing whether to act in acceptance or refusal of the complications of the situation, to act either authentically or inauthentically. In our discussion, we shall see that by taking an inauthentic attitude we can overcomplicate our suffering by acting in ways that seem to simplify our grief. Considerations of these attempts to simplify will reveal that in taking an authentic attitude we avoid overcomplicating our grief and spare ourselves much unnecessary suffering.

      "title": "When work and home collide: A personal reflection of miscarriage and loss",
      "abstract": "Since I can remember it was my dream to work in Paediatrics. Decades of hard work later and I am several years into my specialty training. I'm feeling lucky, all has gone relatively to plan. I have completed my exams and feel prepared to start on my ‘other’ dream of raising a family. I do not envisage this being easy, but I do imagine it slotting in alongside my career aspirations. If only life were so simple. Three miscarriages later and my expectations have been thoroughly shattered. I have been through the ups and downs that many will have experienced following miscarriage and loss. Despite my medical knowledge, I never thought it would happen to me. I feel sure that it will be of no surprise to you that this has had a significant impact on my physical and mental health. More surprising for me has been the impact on my day-to-day working life. Within Paediatrics, it is taken for granted that we enjoy being around children and that many of us will hope for our own. Somehow, it had never occurred to me how consuming and personal this could become until I experienced my own difficulties. My mind could concentrate when managing a sick patient, focusing on guidelines and ABCs (a mnemonic used in resuscitation: Airway, Breathing, Circulation). However, it spiralled when faced with questions and remarks such as: ‘do you have any children?’ or ‘you're lucky not to have children to deal with in the holidays’. These daily ‘throw away’ comments became hurtful and insulting. I wanted to scream that I have had three babies, but of course, the societal expectation when someone has no living children is to say you have none, unless you feel willing and able to go into the details. I hope that the silver lining from my losses will be that I have gained a greater awareness of the difficulties experienced by so many in relation to pregnancy. This is something that should unite and strengthen our understanding of each other, rather than leave us feeling alienated and alone. I have been extremely lucky with the support I have received from colleagues, as well as counselling. I am slowly accepting that I am having to make quite a lot of adjustments to my working life and training progression as I continue this unexpected journey. This has been tough and it is an ongoing battle to work out what is ‘best’. At times, not being able to fulfil my role as a Paediatrician has also contributed to a sense of a loss; our profession is an important part of our identity. What I have learned is that it is impossible to compartmentalise our lives. Each of us has a life outside of work that will impact us on a daily basis. The colleagues who have continued to work alongside me and accepted my situation without judgement have been an immense help. This is not easily achieved in a busy and pressured working environment, but we owe it to each other to try and see past our own stresses and goals. At the end of the day, few of us will escape without any scrapes or collisions as we navigate between work and home. If we can learn to be compassionate to ourselves and to each other that will benefit us all.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic recollections and emotions can weigh heavily on professionals creating a vulnerability to strong, often unconscious feelings and reactions such as rage, bystander's guilt, dread, horror, and a sense of privileged voyeurism. Violent death narrows and spirals into an awareness of helpless terror, a \"black hole\" of painful chaos. The fear of violent death is circumscribed to the dying itself, replayed as a vivid, imaginary drama of a killing. Trauma distress and separation distress are concurrent responses to violent death. Trauma distress takes neuropsychological precedence over separation distress. Because the dysfunctional images and stories are primarily related to the trauma of the dying, supportive strategies to deal with trauma distress are the initial goals of intervention. As violent death is inherently disintegrative and incoherent, the therapist and patient first establish a safe psychological \"space\" for the telling and retelling of the compensatory and restorative stories, separated from the dying imagery of the deceased.",

Disturbingly, it offers these lived and rebellious experiences of leaders around the world as fragmented pieces, originating in different places (where?), times (when?) and dimensions (which?), put together into a collage and then 'let loose' to fly, flow and follow dis/orientating pathways (what might that feel like?). This is about leading rebelliously (why?) by simply resisting to be 'put in pre-existing images' and to do the expected and required; this is about leading rebelliously through questioning (why do that?), through trust and embodiment (how is that done?), through non-human and more-than-human interactions (what might that mean?), through illusion and magic (what?), through hip-hopification (what?) and through going backwards while co-creating the future (what?).

      "abstract": "In these stories whole lives come into focus through single events or sudden memories which bring the past bubbling to the surface. The past, as her characters discover, is made up not only of what is remembered, but also what isn't. The past is there, just out of the picture, but if memories haven't been savoured, recalled in the mind and boxed away, it's as if they have never been - until a moment when the pieces of the jigsaw re-form suddenly, sometimes pleasurably but more often painfully. Women look back at their young selves, at first marriages made when they were naive and trusting, at husbands and their difficult, demanding little ways. There is in this new collection an underlying heartbreak, a sense of regret in her characters for what might have been, for a fork in the road not taken, a memory suppressed in an act of prudent emotional housekeeping. But at the same time there is hope, there are second chances - here are people who reinvent themselves, seize life by the throat, who have moved on and can dare to conjure up the hidden memories, daring to go beyond what is remembered.",

The chapter pays particular attention to disorders of kinship, arguing that the fieldwork experience does not consist simply of collecting stories or coherent narratives with a clear plot and a delineation of characters. Rather, words and gestures swell up suddenly, often out of context, and provide a glimpse into the turbulent waters that often flow behind the seemingly peaceful and uneventful everyday. Tracking moments such as death-bed statements or moments in a ritual performance when something discordant happens, the chapter delineates how such moments signal the risks to which our actions and expressions are prone. Instead of privileging the psychological subject, the chapter considers the grammatical person with which to think of the self and its opacity. The chapter argues for the salience of the second person as the addressee of a speech event and the relevance of the other for giving life to words. The signature theme of finding one’s voice in one’s history finds ethnographic and literary affirmation in attentiveness to fleeting moments that, from another perspective, it is argued, might last forever.",

      "title": "The power of Empowerment",
      "abstract": "Most of you taking the time to read this will recognize that we are all managers (either “autocratic” or “democratic”) in the various capacities of our lives. The style of management that you employ may even be different depending on the situation. You may act differently when you are managing your home, your practice, the team you coach, or another organization that you run. I am guessing that each and every one of us perceives ourselves to be good managers in each of these situations. And yet, we have seen that things don't always progress as smoothly as we would like and that we need to make adjustments from time to time. I am certainly no exception.As dentists and orthodontists, most of us have been overachievers for most of our lives. That is how we got to where we are. And, sometimes, we let that go to our heads. If you are like I am, when you get an idea, a problem, or a goal in your head, your mind doesn't rest until you can figure out how to fully grasp that idea, solve that problem, or achieve that goal. Persistence and determination can be valuable traits, but they can be debilitating as well. One of the hardest things for me to learn has been that I can't (or shouldn't) do everything by myself.I learned a valuable lesson from an experience I had involving our resident practice at the school clinic a few years ago. To make a long story short, there were a couple of unexplainable incidents involving missing supplies, poor organization, and behind the back gossip that seems to be common in many office situations. I tried to handle the situation myself and I ended up blowing things out of proportion by overthinking them, and thereby I made matters worse; a classic case of over-reaction on my part. When the school administration got involved, they suggested I hire a new practice manager to take control. We wrote up a list of responsibilities and hired a young and energetic person to take on this job.The new practice manager was eager to accomplish the tasks before her and quickly assumed responsibility for performing all of them herself. She ordered the supplies, took care of the equipment repairs, wrote a new clinic manual, organized the schedule, and even took on an ambitious marketing campaign for our practice. What the rest of the staff saw was someone who worked in an office while they took care of all the patients. The assistants learned quickly that this new practice manager would cover for them when they were out, and take x-rays for them when they were busy. The assistants in our practice had lost their sense of empowerment because they were left out of the process. The orthodontic residents were learning a poor management style and I'm sure the patients themselves could also feel the underlying tension in the practice.BusinessDictionary.com defines Empowerment as: “A management practice of sharing information, rewards, and power with employees so that they can take initiative and make decisions to solve problems and improve service and performance. Empowerment is based on the idea that giving employees skills, resources, authority, opportunity, motivation, as well as holding them responsible and accountable for outcomes of their actions, will contribute to their competence and satisfaction.” What an enlightening concept!When the practice manager left to explore other opportunities, we chose not to fill the open position. Instead, we divided the responsibilities and created an interwoven system where each staff member depends on input from other members to get their own jobs done. For example, one is responsible for keeping inventory but another is responsible for ordering supplies. Everyone is intimately involved and they need to work together. Every week, we meet for an hour or so to discuss how each aspect of the practice is doing and what we can do to make it better. After about two months, the initial shock behind the change wore off and everything started humming harmoniously. Everyone is busier now but they work more efficiently and are more satisfied overall. The positive difference is clearly evident and even our financial situation has improved dramatically. Most important to me is that we now have a happier workplace for the employees (including myself!), a more energetic environment for our patients, and a better learning experience for our orthodontic residents.I am not naïve enough to believe that this seemingly utopian model is ideal for every situation or that it will continue to function forever without adjustment. Indeed, it might even work better under the supervision of a democratically-minded, full-time practice manager. The key ingredients are always having the right people in the right positions. However, I do believe that a management style incorporating empowerment is essential to the well-being of any working environment. For me, the challenge is to be able to continue to provide this for the employees in my department and the residents in my academic program while resisting the ever-present temptation to do everything myself, and also while working under control of the larger institution that employs me.",

This is my personal story of secrets, control, power, abuse, trauma, chaos, confusion, “psychosis” and madness. During the last 25 years in secondary mental health services, I have had little opportunity to have my story heard or the support to make sense of what happened and is still happening to me. It is only in the last year, that I have begun to take some control back by re-storying myself and making some sense of everything that has happened to me. It’s difficult. The voices I hear confuse and frighten me, conflicting messages from the medicalised mental health system I can’t escape from, the welfare benefits system that seems to rely on diagnosis and articles and debates regarding whether the labels I have been forced to wear for so long are valid and helpful. This is a story with no happy ending. Yet, somewhere deep within me I’m learning to have hope that one day I will know who I actually am, that I will get some support to do this, and that I actually deserve to live and not just survive.",

He is the outcome of ambition, his own ambition to reach a social status which by assigning him a function and an image, provides him with identity, goals, and eventually reasons for living ; and the outcome of an economic and social background, the depression, which by defining the means, upsets his conquest of a social status of forces him to react more than he used to do. So, living at douala, is acting, inventing strategies as the man you are and as the man you would like to become, but all this not a priori make up a consistent whole, it falls short of one's expectations and does not show one the way.

      "abstract": "I want briefly to reflect on the connotations of the word ‘tolerance’. This is but natural, not just from a philosophical standpoint but from that of language and literature, of which I am a student. No doubt, there is an affirmative side to tolerance. It implies acceptance, forbearance, open-mindedness, patience, even charity. But the connotations of the word, at least to me, are not entirely positive. Tolerance suggests a reluctant, even forced, acceptance of the Other. It stops short of respect or appreciation. In fact, it might even imply an uneasy coexistence. Etymologically, the word suggests a burden, coming from the Latin tollere, which means to lift up. Tolerance is not the best possible attitude to Others, but rather the minimum prerequisite for social harmony. It is also used to indicate the interdiction of something undesirable as in the phrase ‘zero tolerance’. Overall, I don't think it to be a happy word. We may, perhaps, need to begin with tolerance, but must not end with it. We will have to go much farther than tolerance, work much harder on ourselves if we really want this world to be peaceful. The principle of tolerance will have to be converted to that of love, love that is proactive, powerful, and healing. The politics of conflict must be replaced by the politics of embrace if perpetual peace is to be institutionalized on earth.",

However, we also speak of lonely places. Sometimes, a place strikes us as lonely even when we do not feel lonely ourselves. On other occasions, finding a place lonely also involves feeling lonely, isolated, and lost. In this paper, I reflect on the phenomenological structure of loneliness by addressing what it is to experience a place as lonely. I suggest that approaching loneliness in this way can help us to see how it involves not merely the lack or absence of something but, more specifically, the sense of being unable to access social and personal possibilities that may still appear accessible to others.",

      "abstract": "FigureGrief and joy. These two emotions continue to be part of my life since the pandemic. Maybe for you as well. I used to believe that either I walked emotionally in a place of grief or in a place of joy—opposite ends of the street. The loss of my father to congestive heart failure and my husband's diagnosis of multiple dementias dragged me from grief to depression. The grief I felt consumed me. It broke me. I felt hollow, numb, empty. I questioned myself, wondering if I had done all I could have to care for my father in those final 7 weeks. Was there something more I could have done to decrease his suffering? With my husband, I doubted whether I would be strong enough to care for and support him in the years to come. Our lives were not supposed to end like this. I began to learn that our hearts can break again and again. Frustration and anger began to build. The delays in getting appointments with mental health providers and my husband's primary care provider amounted to months of time passing us by. I researched options and made recommendations for medications to help decrease his symptoms. Was I his wife, his nurse, or his care provider? I continued to ask God, \"Why?\" Head knowledge reminded me God was with me. But I struggled to sense his presence. The stress and loneliness were overwhelming. My emotions are not unique. Mental Health America (2022) received 1,119 survey responses in 2020 from healthcare workers reporting similar feelings of stress (93%), anxiety (86%), frustration (77%), exhaustion and burnout (76%), as well as being overwhelmed (76%). Recognizing these needs, Nurses Christian Fellowship (NCF) continues to be intentional in addressing the mental health and spiritual needs of the nursing profession. The Journal of Christian Nursing produces content to connect faith with our practice of nursing. Articles focusing on posttraumatic stress disorder risks for nursing students, being intentionally connected with each other, and compassion fatigue address current needs. Through NCF, 120-plus student groups and 40-plus professional nurse groups meet. The leaders of these groups have a passion for Jesus, for others, and for the profession. Our student ministries team has provided a half-day retreat to help students find peace within nursing school. New ministry opportunities focusing on mentoring with recent graduates has begun. We have a team of nurses across the country who stand in the gap for other nurses as prayer partners (https://ncf-jcn.org/prayer). Our recorded Tabletop Discussions (https://ncf-jcn.org/membership/tabletop-discussions) focus on the challenges we face in our faith and practice and have covered content such as asking where God is when we hurt, understanding the spiritual discipline of lament, and steps we can take to reconnect in our relationships with Jesus, ourselves, and others. The Twin Cities NCF nurse group recorded a three-part series on promoting spiritual care for nurses (https://ncf-jcn.org/resources/spiritual-care-webinars). New Bible studies are available (https://ncf-jcn.org/resource/bible-study-materials), including those focusing on mental health. On our NCF Blog (https://ncf-jcn.org/blog/), we share the stories and challenges of students and nurses. For me, NCF has been life-giving in my spiritual and mental health recovery. I have learned it is possible to hold grief and joy at the same time. And NCF stands ready to be present in the challenges you face. You are not alone. Please contact us and take advantage of all that is a part of NCF. Share NCF with others! It truly is about relationship.

      "title": "Beyond Peace Education: Toward Co-Poiesis and Enduring Improvisation",
      "abstract": "Is it possible that the essence of peace is negated in peace education? And is it possible that even against its own will peace education calls for the negation of its negation? In peace education no serious attempts have been made to elaborate its most central concepts. ‘Pacifism’, ‘violence’, ‘counter-violence’ and ‘emancipation’, ‘culture of peace’, among others, have still not been probed. Peace education, actually, is a serious threat to human edification. Peace for the eternal Jew, for the enduring improviser, is a condition of the one who found his way: an endless path of a nomad that has Love but no other ‘home’, dogma or quest for ‘home-returning’ into thingness, the continuum or the Same. He will never find and never search for ‘peace’ as an end of Diasporic existence and terminality of the suffering of the nomad. He will be at peace with his mission of avoiding history within history, of overcoming the temptation to be part of the collective ‘I’/consensus/pleasure machine/truth, and often he will be tired, ridiculed, punished or executed. But he will be also rewarded, each moment anew, for being at peace with his refusal of ‘peace’: he will be a freer and a richer improviser that his co-poiesis with the world, the Other, and he himself gives birth to Love. As such, the eternal improviser is mature enough to meet the alterity of other free nomads and Diasporic humans, as well as the gifts of other free-minded spirits. They too, as Nietzsche tell us, feel at home on the mountain, in the forest, and within their loneliness. But for the eternal improviser there is more and there is less than the rewards of the eternal Nietzschean nomad. This is so since the Nietzschean nomad is rewarded with presents and finally finds harmony in himself and the right path to the freedom of reason. The eternal improviser, however, is a more consistent Nietzschean than the Nietzschean nomad and is never appeased, domesticated or rewarded by any ‘home’. Homelessness, eternal Diaspora and improvisation worthy of the name cannot offer any ‘reward’ or rest in the (right) paved way, be it ‘external’ or ‘internal’, transcendent or immanent. Here counter-education reintroduces peace as a realization of Love and worthy togetherness with the cosmos, with the Other, with worthy suffering and with one's self.",

      "abstract": "This рарer fосuses on transphobia and how the character Marci Wise in When they see us lie victim to transphobia. Transphobia comes from people harassing or discriminating transgender mentally and physically because of the fact that they are uncomfortable or scared with their gender identities. For these people, or transphobes, any gender other than a cis-male of cis-female is wild and out of their imaginations. It has been found that transphobia can even create discrimination towards transgendered people in many ways of them being denied of jobs loans, housing, or health care just because of the fact that their gender identity is not matching up to the norms. It does not help the fact that transgenders are always on the look out for getting attacked, much like what happened to Korey Wise's sister, Marci wise in When They See Us. Some of the mental health issues that transgenders in common faces are paranoia, living in constant fear, isolation, depression, self hate, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and self disgust. As times goes on, the person would feel sad; disconnected from everything and everyone, an emptiness began to settle in their mind. In the fourth episode of When They See us, the viewers get a glimpse into the life of Korea Wise's transgender sister, Marci Wise. Her struggles, how the lack of acceptances from everyone but her brother affected her, how she was treated by her own mother as a disease and an abomination, and in the end, how she died because people refused to see her as a person like them. This paper analyses the transphobia that Marci Wise has faced and the cause for it.",

It is, of course, a fundamental part of trying to tune into another person that they aim to put ourselves empathically into their shoes, in the context of their life story, with their particular experiences and sensitivities, in order to imagine how this person might see life and feel about its many vicissitudes. What is most uniquely true of the other person will always lie beyond the therapists' own imagining. So, the therapists are likely to recognize the familiar in the other much more readily than that which is unfamiliar. And sometimes they will defend themselves against the unfamiliar in their patients, for there the therapists are most likely to find themselves feeling incompetent and out of our depth. Facing the unknown will always be a far greater challenge than staying with the known.",

      "title": "Utility Maximizers in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas",
      "abstract": "Maximizers in isolated Prisoner's Dilemmas are doomed to frustration. But in Braybrooke's view maximizers might do better in a series, securing Pareto-optimal arrangements if not from the very beginning, at least eventually. Given certain favourable special conditions, it can be shown according to Braybrooke and shown even without question-begging motivational or value assumptions, that in a series of Dilemmas maximizers could manage to communicate a readiness to reciprocate, generate thereby expectations of reciprocation, and so give rise to optimizing reciprocations which, in due course, would reinforce expectations, the net result of all this being an increasingly stable practice to mutual benefit. In this way neighbours could learn to be good neighbours: they could learn to respect each other's property, to engage in reciprocal assistance, and perhaps even to make and keep promises covering a range of activities. So maximizers are, Braybrooke holds, capable of a society of sorts. Out of the ashes they might build something. But even under favourable conditions they could not build much and most conditions would defeat them almost entirely, for many-person Dilemmas whether isolated or in series would be quite beyond them, question-begging motivational assumptions aside. In settings at all like those in which we live, utility maximization assuming only ‘traditional’ motivation is self-defeating without remedy, and most certainly not an adequate basis for social life.' The probable inference from as a conception of individual rationality: for surely truly rational agents would be if not perfectly well designed at least better designed for communal living than utility maximizers would be assuming only ‘traditional’, non-question-begging values or motivation. Or, if this inference is denied and maximization is not challenged as a conception of rationality, we can conclude instead, Braybrooke has more recently suggested (p. 34, this issue), that the advice, ‘Be rational,’ is incomplete, and when addressed to groups should be supplemented by, ‘And be somewhat ‘untraditional’ in your values; respect at least some rules that would make coordination and cooperation possible even in many-person interaction problems.’",

I understand that one can choose it deliberately; I am aware of the joy that children can bring when they have been wanted.

      "title": "Commentary on an Excerpt From In the Country of Hearts",
      "abstract": "I know several people who wake into chronic pain every morning. I think of them when I wake with an annoying headache or find that my slightly arthritic foot isn’t bearing my weight happily. Acute pain I have had, and can imagine. Chronic pain borders on the unimaginable. Each of these friends—one with multiple sclerosis, one with advanced arthritis, and one who has recently had her 10th back surgery following extensive damage suffered in an automobile accident—has developed coping strategies. They plan, and their daily plans are modest. They organize the objects around them according to accessibility, weight, and frequency of use. Even as they remain determinedly independent, they foster the kinds of friendships where frank conversation about their physical needs happens easily: When they need help, they ask; when they don’t, they say so. And when the help isn’t quite what they need, they often say that, too. They laugh and weep with equal candor. And most of their time is spent reaching past their pain into a world whose needs may be the more apparent to them because they know need. One is a pastor and political activist. One teaches college courses from her wheelchair. One finds ways to change the lives of at-risk immigrants and people in various kinds of recovery who seem to cross her path with remarkable regularity. They have learned things from living with their pain that can’t be reduced (or elevated) to some ideal of saintly patience or stoicism. Like an older woman who was asked once what gifts she had to offer her community, they have “been through things,” and that is what they bring, without fanfare, when the tribe gathers. John Stone’s empathetic observations about the difference between acute and chronic pain in this short excerpt from In the Country of Hearts are the kind that require an imagination willing to dwell on the details and locate the metaphors that enable a precision that fuels real compassion. The wild beast at the foot of the bed embodies several dimensions of pain: It is other, not self. It lurks, even when it is not attacking. Its “wildness” lies in its unpredictability; it could strike any time, or lie for a period of uneasy peace in the shadows, napping. It is no respecter of human boundaries, or of human authority. It moves according to its own law, which is impersonal and implacable. The electricity in the forearm offers a geography of pain where riverbeds are dug into the body by a current that gradually erodes one’s defenses. The current breaches those defenses as rivers do their banks when they can no longer accommodate floodwaters. From arm to wrists to fingers, the current claims all available tributaries and the body becomes a site where natural forces supersede the brain’s benevolent dictatorship. The words one finds to name the pain have to be rediscovered and retrieved each time, the alphabet reorganized for new “raids on the inarticulate,” as T.S. Eliot put it. It slices or scorches or floods or unfurls. It fills or empties. It charges or deadens. It sharpens focus or obliterates all categories. It is glib and unhelpful to romanticize those who live with the kind of pain Stone writes about in this generously imaginative passage. While they may, in fact, be heroic, most of them don’t want that badge, preferring to retain their membership in the large association of ordinary folks who grumble a little, find amusement where they can, and manage what they must or, as my grandmother put it, “make do.” The people I know who live with a beast at the foot of their beds have developed skill sets that make them canny, pragmatic, and, at the risk of falling into cliché, wise, if wisdom is knowing when to submit prudently and when to risk pain for the sake of deep and costly pleasure. I learn from them. As Stone rightly reminds us, those among us who suffer bear something to which the rest of us would do well to bear witness. They manifest a plasticity of will and intention and a range of endurance that can lead us, whose turn for great pain has not yet come, to a more complex vision of hope and a humbler reckoning of our own economies of energy. Even when they complain, when they withdraw into exhaustion or grow thorns of irritability, or perhaps especially then, they help us chart the waters we are all navigating, sailing a little closer to the edge, which the ancient cartographers marked with the cryptic warning, “Here be dragons.” Marilyn McEntyre, PhD M.

      "title": "Behaving respectfully",
      "abstract": "“Respect your elders.” “Show some respect.” “He’s my supervi­sor, I must respect him.” Respect is a feeling of esteem and admiration. Yet it is also a behavior, showing consideration and goodwill. These two manifestations of respect are important distinctions as we navi­gate relationships with others and choose our behaviors toward them. What we sometimes forget is that respect can simply be behaved. We can “behave our way into it.” We need not respect someone in order to behave respect­fully toward them. And it is the “behaving respectfully toward” that maintains the health of schools and school relationships. At times when we do not feel esteem toward another, we can “behave our way into” what is necessary and best. It is possible that respect more frequently involves behav­ior than attitude. For example, we may not have reason to feel respect toward everyone we encounter. How do we know strang­ers are worthy of our respect? Even for those who may not be worthy, we can behave respectfully toward them anyway. See the difference? How do we make a habit of behaving respectfully? We behave as if we respect a person. We behave as if the person respects us. We behave in a manner that the situation calls for. And we make choices to be considerate, to show the best of ourselves, even though the other may not have earned or deserved our respect. You may think adopting this calculated responsiveness aims to serve the other person. But it really serves us both. When we reserve judgment long enough to shift to behaving respectfully, we are the benefactors as much as the recipients are. We reframe negative assumptions. We give the benefit of the doubt. We sus­pend judgment. Each of these intentions serves our own mental, physical, and social health. Imagine the possibilities for schools if teachers, parents, administrators, and students learn that behaving respectfully is something we can all do. Imagine a habit of mind in which behaving respectfully is an automatic balm for our spirits: it bol­sters us, it gives us confidence, and it revitalizes our power to be generous and kind.",

The birth of a new identity or redefining her identity after this traumatic event was accompanied obviously by a necessary mourning. A reached serenity; and the time between the traumatic event of her sons' deaths and the present reveals an incontestable psychological truth: any suffering well-lived and integrated in life as a whole can stimulate the person to develop a new identity.

That done, the restlessness is laid, the book finished; it can be put upon the shelf, and need never be read again. But with the work of other novelists it is different. Tristram Shandy or Pride and Prejudice is complete in itself; it is self-contained; it leaves one with no desire to do anything, except indeed to read the book again, and to understand it better.... But the Edwardians were never interested in character in itself; or in the book in itself. They were interested in something outside. Their books, then, were incomplete as books, and required that the reader should finish them, actively and practically, for himself.'",

After all, each area of knowledge is vast in scope and requires a distinctive method or approach, and we all find ourselves harassed by the limitations of the time available to us for expanding our knowledge. Surely the lessons taught us by our work and by our enormously productive economic system confirm day by day the wisdom of specialization. Specialization in the workplace helps us see that we can best hone competence through discipline and through the repetitive practices that enable us to know deeper the intricacies of a craft or profession. We hear praise these days for people who are able to exercise what is called \"compartmentalization,\" meaning that they maintain a careful separation of distinct aspects of life such as the concerns of family, the ambition of work, and the practice of worship. Efficiency is only a mediate value, always dependent upon an end for the determination of its true worth, and yet we all count upon it on a daily basis and feel hampered and irritated by its absence as we complete our necessary tasks, and living our lives in a \"compartmentalized\" fashion enhances our efficiency. We have many good reasons and many ingrained habits that encourage us to respect the familiar fences we have established in our lives.",

      "title": "The Prophetic Power of Positive Questions",
      "abstract": "As the Baby Boomer generation celebrates their 60th decade, they begin to confront a challenge that is both unfamiliar and formidable. This is the uneasy state of being regarded as old. It happens to all of us. Regardless of our contribution to the workplace, to our families, or any other cultural domain, we begin to feel the threat. In part, the threat is crystallized in the pervasive anxiety that accompanies noticeable changes in our bodies: graying or disappearing hair, increasing wrinkles, poorer eyesight and less acute hearing, expanding girth, slower reflexes, and diminished stamina. All are signals that our capacity to maintain our participation in the active and productive world of adulthood is in decline. They are also signals of impending mortality. Subtle changes begin to take place in our relationships with others as well. In the workplace younger colleagues and budget-conscious administrators seem eager for an announcement of retirement. People offer their seat on public transit, help with your luggage or grocery bags, and address you with an extra tone of formality. Sometimes there is an air of impatience if you have not moved swiftly or confidently enough, walking or driving. To seemingly quell these fears, the advertising industry suggests that products and services are available that can help one to control or hide these defects: liposuction, plastic surgery, Botox, hair dyes, cosmetics, exercise equipment, yoga, health clubs, pills and psychotherapy. Yet, the very pressure to succumb to these age-defying efforts, are also reminders that you are slowly decaying. Older people are challenged as well by continuous questioning of competence and activity. It is there in the subtle ways in which others increasingly ask, you still.... (fill in the blanks)? Are you still working... still skiing... still scuba diving...still driving cross-country, and so on. Such questions suggest that whatever one is doing is becoming exceptional, as and withdrawal are normal. With retirement the barrage of questions intensifies: Where will you live? What will you do? Where will you go? Once one is no longer committed to a workplace, the options for living seem obscure, and there are no viable criteria remaining for choice. And, layered upon these distressing questions are those anguished doubts one entertains in private: Am I more forgetful, less attractive, slower mentally, less physically capable, less sexually appealing, and so on. We join with the Beatles who so aptly sang: Will you still love me, will you still need me, when I'm 64? More profoundly: Who am I becoming? Is there nothing left for me now but the continuous course down hill? The Coining Resistance to the Negative Question The source of these nagging questions is primarily the aging process itself. Decline seems natural and obvious. But is this what truly happens? To be sure, there are changes, but why do they count as decline? The word decline is an evaluative judgment that is not given in the change itself. There is nothing about graying or thinning hair that is intrinsically worse or better than a full head of dark hair. To see these as is",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychologically speaking, human beings respond to persons and events not necessarily as they are but as they are perceived. Suicide can be viewed as either an escape or a solution, a threat to family or therapists, or even a moral obligation. The article suggests that those wishing to help become aware of their own feelings and opinions about the possible reasons for suicide, acknowledge that life is complex and often painful, and think of the person who contemplates suicide as both a distinct individual and fellow human being. Through honesty one may suggest to the client that it is indeed possible to see the marvels of life while remaining aware of its pain and burdens.",

      "abstract": "Not being understood in the domestic sphere and its associated forms of depression are yet to be widely acknowledged and accepted as a mental health issue in India. The gendered programming of domestic/familial roles often relegate the woman into functions that are monotonous, laborious and daunting. Much of the household work is associated with the procuring, preparation and serving of food. The Kitchen invariably becomes the centre of all activity – a place where nourishment for the entire family emanates and aspirations of the individual woman, are put on the burner. The seething emotions often bubble over, simmering in a cauldron of ignorance, ingratitude and a sense of obscurity bestowed upon by the family. Sacrifices are aplenty; rewards and recognition – zilch. This insensitivity and indifference leads to a vortex of emotions that build into a volley of issues ranging from anger, irritation, pain, suffering, loneliness and depression. A woman becomes lost in the process of nurturing the lives of her loved ones while yearning for love, respect, identity and realization of her dreams. The mental balance is lost. This is where Poetry comes in handy as a medium of expression. Studies have proven the healing effect of words. This paper is an attempt at unravelling the cathartic and therapeutic essence of poems on mental well-being. The scholar, through a reading of poetry by Hiba Ashraf, Vimala and others, aims to provide an analysis and interpretation of select poems that establish a cathartic and restorative relationship between poems and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Although Queenston and Kelley parents differed markedly in the type of hard individualism they espoused (defensive vs. offensive), they did share certain themes in a general ethnoconception of the child’s self. Queenston and Kelley parents’ discussions about their children often centered on descriptions of the importance of moving from soft selves to hard and tough selves. If the boundaries of the self were too porous or soft, the negative influences of the street (prostitution, violence, drugs, alcohol, peer pressure, gangs) could penetrate and take over. Unless you were careful, there were plenty of people that would “walk right over you.” The boundaries of the self could be trespassed through conversion, lack of resistance, softness. As one quite protective Queenston mother said of her child, “If you don’t have your own self-awareness, then anyone can get inside of you and change you. People can, if you don’t believe in something strong enough, can be converted. If you don’t believe in yourself, then yourself can be converted.” A Kelley mother described her son Edward as “very happy-go-lucky, sweet personality, easy to get along with, sometimes a little too easy. I fear that somebody will smile at him and he’ll say, ‘OK, I’ll go with you.’ I try and teach him that not everybody is his friend.” One mother who was planning on moving from Queenston because of the violence in the community spoke of the self-confidence needed in order to resist the world’s corruption.",

Aspiration is distinct from <italic>ambition</italic>, in which agents make large-scale changes in the world without coming to learn why they are doing so. If some pursuit—e.g., becoming a gangster—is bereft of value at the endpoint, it cannot be engaged in aspirationally.

The heroine, Addie’s passion of life is blocked by her husband Anse’s selfishness and laziness. Anse represents the distorted aspects of convention. His love is different from what Addie wants from him. So she does not believe the word ‘love’. Instead, she believes in the physical actions in which she perceives their bloods are mixed and become one while Anse makes use of the convention for his own purpose. His strategy is to dry up other people’s patience and simplify everything into shame or guilty. Their distorted relationship influence their children who take part in Addie’s burial journey with each one having his or her own secret and motive. Their world is a closed one where each one has its own territory isolated from others making this journey terrible and grotesque. At the end of the journey their gains are too petty to be perceived compared with their difficulties and efforts. It proves to be the triumph of manipulative conventionality that Anse best represents. But at the background of this final scene, the ever lasting human virtues such as creative passion, patience, devotion, devotion and service remain as human potentials.",

      "title": "Not Today, Lack of Self-Control, Not Today",
      "abstract": "As one of your favorite clients, Emmy, is in the homestretch of your expertly crafted workout, she again expresses her frustration that she failed to walk after work the day before. “Why does this keep happening? I have every intention of walking after work, but then I’m just too tired when I get home.” Can we get a retweet on that? How many times do our clients, and ourselves for that matter, have the best of intentions but then fail to follow through with our planned action? Might self-control be a key variable in better understanding why we do what we do or why we fail to do what we set out to do? Grab a cup of coffee (or protein shake), take a seat (or pop a wall squat), and let’s chat about self-control. WHAT IS SELF-CONTROL? Self-control is the ability that allows people to exert control over behaviors, thoughts, and emotions to pursue goals (1–3). Self-control is not an infinite resource (Can we get an Amen?), but one that becomes depleted after a period of self-control exertion, which can only be replenished after a period of recovery (4). Thus, why should we care about self-control? Have you noticed, like Emmy, you do not always follow through with your intentions? Maybe you thought it was just you, but research has shown that although behavioral intentions are important, they are not enough to engage in a behavior (5). Most of us have a list of healthy intentions we would like to accomplish each day: eat a healthy diet, engage in the recommended amount of physical activity, manage our stress levels, and get a great night of rest. Alas, how often do we actually fulfill all these intentions in one day? WHAT IS THE STRENGTH ENERGY MODEL? In the Strength Energy Model (SEM) of self-control, self-control is viewed as a finite resource that can become depleted after effortful expenditure, which can then lead to impaired self-control for future tasks, termed ego depletion (6,7). More specifically, ego depletion occurs when an individual’s diminished self-control resources lead to a reduction in capacity or willingness to implement further control (6,8). After depletion, subsequent use of self-control is limited and can result in self-regulatory failure. This analogy is similar to a muscle that becomes fatigued after continued use and must be rested before further use. This model further states that self-control is a global resource, meaning all actions that require self-control pull from the same finite global source. Meaning that a tough day at the office or school where you were forced to expend much of your self-control can leave you in a vulnerable position in the evening — suddenly that freshly baked muffin looks much more appealing than your evening workout. Take a minute to think about it, on days when you had to bite your tongue and not lash out or sit through meeting upon meeting upon meeting, were you more likely to have self-control lapses those evenings? Many would answer “yes” to this question.Let us paint you a picture, a hypothetical picture of course, of what can occur in ego depletion. You are in the Chicago airport. You finally board your flight after a three-hour delay and six gate changes. You have a heightened sense of self because you have smiled your way past all the TSA employees that gave you the infamous “random” strip search. The plane is ready for takeoff. You are putting in your earphones to watch the newest Aladdin movie that you were too busy to go watch in theaters. You are thanking all that you believe in that there is no crying infant in the cabin. Then … as the film’s opening song begins … a precious tyrant sitting behind you begins to kick the back of your seat, as if it was a hacky sack. You hold your tongue, clench the arm rests, press your seat as far back as it will go to subtly limit the range of motion in the swing, and the child’s parents are blissfully unaware because they are having the sweet dreams you wished you yourself were having. You make it the whole flight demonstrating exquisite self-control. You are now mentally and physically exhausted, and you are ignorant to your soon-to-come explosion. You reach baggage claim, about to head home, only to find out your luggage was taken on the flight on what was your fourth gate change. You storm to the worker’s desk, raise Cain, make a scene, and send in an unhealthy worded letter about everything wrong that happened on your trip back. You thought you were fine, but alas, you were not — you put the “depleted” in ego-depleted. Clearly, this was a hypothetical situation.* Throughout the day, we all expend self-control. It starts with the sound of the alarm, ugh is it really already time to get up? Yes, you would prefer to stay in bed, but you decide to rise and shine anyway. Good-bye to a bit of self-control. You are going through your morning routine — time for breakfast, hmm … Greek yogurt and fruit or a morning muffin. Oh that morning muffin would be good, but you decide to go with the Greek yogurt and fruit — pour out some self-control. On the way to the office, someone cuts you off. Instead of going full-blown Rambo in your car, you decide to restrain yourself … you do not have time to be arrested this morning … again, there goes some self-control. A doozy of a day at the office; you have a 5 p.m. deadline to meet and you skip lunch … no time. Your colleagues clearly woke up on the wrong side of their beds this morning, do not lash back, it’s not worth it … just sprinkle out that self-control. On the drive home after a stressful day, you go back and forth in your head … “I should work out, but it has been a long, exhausting day.” Fast forward an hour, you are on your couch, Netflixing for the win and enjoying that muffin you wanted for breakfast (it is delicious by the way), and no, you did not work out … you decide you will work out tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow you will definitely work out. Can you relate to this? If so, let us not sit idly by. Let us discuss how to pump up our and our clients’ self-control abilities. PUMPING UP SELF-CONTROL Limber Up, Time to Train We can train self-control just like we train our physical muscles by exposing ourselves to situations where we successfully use self-control and then provide ourselves with sufficient breaks to allow for self-control replenishment (9). In sports, we are told to be proactive, not reactive. This is true in self-control development as well. We must choose to put ourselves in situations that require self-control to increase our self-control capacity. Everyone knows his/her strengths, weaknesses, likes, and dislikes. Practically, one can put himself/herself in a situation that is taxing and then remove himself/herself and allow recharging to occur. You and your clients will grow through these efforts. Slow and Steady Wins the Race According to the SEM, trying to change too much at one time will lead to self-control failure and the “I do not do what I want, but the very thing I hate” moments. With this in mind, consider having your client introduce one new action at a time and allow a bit of time before introducing the next new action so that appropriate self-control will be available to be successful. Competence, the need to gain mastery over tasks, is another human need explained by self-determination theory (10). Introducing one new behavior at a time and allowing your client to be successful will lead to increased levels of competence. Have your client embrace his/her inner tortoise (call your client that at your own risk) and aim to empower him/her to run the marathon, not the sprint. If Possible, Automate Why not try to lessen the power of self-control in our daily decisions? Enter automation. By automating behavior, we may be able to preserve our self-control resources (11). We can do this by automating certain healthy decisions. For instance, automating your breakfast choice Monday through Friday is one option. Instead of having to contemplate each morning what you will eat, decide to eat a consistently healthy breakfast during the week. At first, you will still have to expend self-control making this decision, but as you continue to engage in the same behavior, it will become more and more automatic until you no longer spend much time thinking about it. Another example would be to engage in morning exercise. After your morning cup of coffee, you head to the gym — this becomes your normal routine. Exercising in the morning also might be helpful for those who continuously find themselves depleted in the evenings. Use Your Noggin, Plan Ahead Implementation intentions are “if–then” action plans that increase the likelihood of individuals carrying out the proposed action/behavior (12). For instance, an implementation intention for our rockstar of a client, Emmy, might be that during her 1-hour lunch break, she will take a 15-minute walk. Implementation intentions go hand in hand with automation. Your client is the expert on himself/herself — partner with your client to best understand vulnerable times in his/her day. Once these are determined, guide your client to create his/her own implementation intention for the specific situation. For instance, maybe coming home from work is a vulnerable time for your client where he/she often goes for a sweet treat. Instead of the current learned behavior, “When I get home, I will have a sugary treat,” look to adapt to “When I get home, I will have a piece of fruit.” WRAP-UP Self-control will not grow itself. Embrace your inner farmer and view self-control as the fruit of the tree you wish to grow. You must plant, water, and harvest the seed to grow the strongest, most fruitful tree. Over time, your tree is tested and grows stronger bearing more self-control. You must be proactive in this process, exposing yourself to self-control expending situations and then allowing for recharging. Self-control is a maturation process that is never fully finished, yet much progress can be made. Hence, arise from your seat or wall squat, channel your inner tortoise, and start developing your and your client’s self-control today.",

Even in hell it is possible to find something to believe in that exalts the human spirit for its nobility amid forces that would debase it. The creed that became Kipling’s religion and occupied the center stage of his writing involved certain specific ways of thinking and acting among which was a realistic awareness of the hellish nature of existence and of the terrible inevitability of extermination, a keen sensitivity to the overwhelming unfairness that characterizes the human condition, and a rare ability born of courage and resentment to withstand certain ignoble temptations with which we are cursed from birth—the temptation cravenly to whine or panic when the certainty of our mutual destiny is made clear; the temptation to forgo discipline, dignity, and order when meaninglessness and chaos emerge as the prevalent aspects of existence; the temptation to forget duty, self-sacrifice, and service amid universal selfishness, and the temptation to abandon the ideals of fidelity to self and to truth in the face of almost universal dishonesty, deception, and blindness.",

      "abstract": "Our experiences of being and working in groups are often powerful and overwhelming. We experience the tension between the wish to join together and the wish to be separate; between the need for togetherness and belonging and the need for an independent identity. Many of the puzzling phenomena of group life stem from this, and it is often difficult to recognise the more frequent reality of mutual interdependence. No man is an island, and yet we wish to believe we are independent of forces of which we may not be conscious, either from outside ourselves or from within. At times we are aware of these pulls within ourselves; at other times they overwhelm us and become the source of irrational group behaviour. This chapter explores the application of Wilfred Bion's basic assumption theory to the dynamics of groups and the difficulties of cooperation in multidisciplinary teams where different professions mobilise different basic assumptions.",

It looks like students who expect teachers to do a high level of their work and their thinking FOR them. Meanwhile, borders are opening, careers are ever-changing, and economies are shaky. An attitude of entitlement in this age is a recipe for failure. Educators MUST combat this \"entitlementality.\" Society, although well-intentioned, has unfortunately caused the problem. A relatively \"good\" and easy life, disconnectedness from nature and other real systems, and a mangled message of \"empowerment\" decoupled from hard work have symbolically changed L'Oreal's slogan from \"I'm worth it\" into a whiny \"I deserve it.\" This is a battle worth fighting, and the paper offers techniques to do it – good goals in and of themselves: creativity, empathy, gratitude, and meaningful personal projects.",

The span of history offers little consolation or challenge to such a system; the challenges come from the environment, which is full of threat and possibility at any given time. The long view remains a staple of political rhetoric, whereas decision making follows the polls and the quarterly report. Such societies offer little in the way of symbolic gratification to the individual who is seeking to find in the nation or larger society a personificationof his or her values and commitments. Such societies demystify the passage of time and leave individuals on their own to sort out their ultimate loyalties. As a result, individuals are not torn between this world and some other world that is the consummation of every hope and longing. On the contrary, one is left with the sense that time is the only arena for human struggle. That is, one is no longer torn between allegiance to an earthly or a heavenly city; most conflicts are more mundane, for example, between the city of one’s origin and the one to which one has emigrated later in life. Many immigrants in fact do shuttle back and forth between the countries of their origin and later residence. Those who stay put still live in a welter of earthly allegiances and may indeed be divided by conflicts, say, between home and work. However, it is a minority who long for another world in the midst of this one; their spiritual disease is not inevitable or beyond secular cure.",

Actually, living it creates a new reality where both seem to be largely irrelevant. Having lived it, this \r\nchapter can be seen to be action research and is my own personal narrative of progress and shifts in communication technologies and how they helped (or didn't help) to keep in touch. But, while my own views may give some insight \r\ninto the adaptations of the involuntary traveller, it is necessary to include the perspectives of the other party as well, and so, in writing this chapter, I also consulted my wife for her version of the memories and experiences of \r\nour own remote relationship.

And, not infrequently, the issues that plague them in their earliest years resurface in various ways as they mature. Children who struggle to attend can get much better at sustaining focus yet, at times, will still need scaffolding to stay on task. Youngsters who used to lose their tempers many times a week may need help staying steady during later periods of stress. Kids who are on the reserved side may look increasingly confident, only to lose ground amidst the social complexities of middle school. Fortunately, the work we do to understand young children stands us in good stead as they grow older. The approaches we come up with to help them often still apply as well, with additions and adaptations as circumstances change and development unfolds.

A person moving around all the time, pursuing simultaneously several goals, entering inaccessible private settings, protecting thoughts and feelings against unwanted detection by partners in interactions or from observers—, all this makes observation and recording extremely cumbersome. As a viable substitute, we may rely on people’s narratives, accepting their reconstruction of their experience from memory. No doubt, narratives are important sources of information on people’s lives. They can extend over long periods of time, are flexible with respect to the variety of topics and settings, and provide a structure of personal meaning by relating single events and actions to the world-view, leading strivings, and action plans of a person. There is, however, a long way from real life to the subjects’ narratives and from there to the researcher’s reconstruction of a life history or some part of it. Much imaginative and creative transformation is going on, the conditions and rules of which are not well understood yet (Berscheid, 1994).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Leisure is an opportunity to do and learn things which, in instrumental life, we do not have the chance to do. Leisure should not remain merely ‘time off’, rather it can be used to change our whole lives into enlightening experiences, enriching and strengthening us. In free time, as in initiation, one has the opportunity to meet with himself. The experience itself is the realisation, and the realisation is not performance-oriented. Initiation is a process of accumulated understanding in which, as in leisure time, there may be no end product or ‘place’ we must reach. Initiation, like leisure, changes life into a ca talyst for continual learning. Free time is the space in which initiation takes place; it is a powerful process of further discovery, expanded growth and greater capacity to choose and judge alternatives, and take responsibility upon oneself. Hence, one becomes a ‘chooser’ of what is right for him according to the risks and responsibilities he takes upon himself. As long as one has still not met his uniqueness, he is likely to identify with someone or something. In initiation, no one person is like any other; it is up to each of us to discover this uniqueness.",

How then do people 'do' leisure? How is the free time at their disposal to be filled? Unsatisfactorily-filled leisure is a frequent complaint of clients; albeit often implicit in complaints of feeling generally unhappy because of boredom or lack of friends, partners or a social community of any kind. We get the impression that what some might call 'depression' often seems to have a high boredom content. Some suffer the pain of loss, or of unrequited love, and some may complain of 'loneliness'. Others cope with the boredom of leisure and the pursuit of happiness through the use of 'leisure drugs'. This leads to excesses, addiction or loss of control, which may include criminal activity to fund a craving. The cravings are varied, including a range of 'soft' and 'hard' drugs, alcohol, tobacco — or just shopping or spending. Leisure-without-boredom is a complex construction; leisure-withcontentment/happiness is not easy to construct as many clients will see it as the absence of something, rather than the presence of something, or the doing of something specific.KeywordsNarrative ApproachProtestant Work EthicDaily WalkSocial DrinkingTotal AbstinenceThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

I approached this by cultivating my informal authority: building strong connections with the company by actively seeking trusting relationships and demonstrating my unwavering commitment to the collaboration. What proved challenging was exercising my formal authority and trusting my instinct to courageously initiate challenging conversations. When the process required me to embrace the full responsibility of the formal leader, I allowed fear and the weight of judgment and uncertainty to suppress my voice and retreat.In the play, the character of Bigger struggles to honor his instincts and trust his heart to make the right choice. Bigger is persuaded by The Black Rat, his inner voice, to play it safe and act against his truth. This process has taught me that embodying vulnerability and allowing my instincts to guide me through the many challenging situations that arise make me a resilient and compassionate leader. By advocating for my collaborators and myself, taking big risks, and using adaptive language, I can influence the process in innumerable ways. I know I embody the necessary tools to lead authentically, and intend to further invest in the explicit responsibility required to lead artistic collaborative processes both informally and formally.",

Achieving balance sounds like a simple goal, but it’s easier said than done. The pressures of the workplace can be tremendous. Because the corporate culture of many organizations negates family values, those pressures affect not only the employee but also the family. And as if workplace pressures weren’t enough, we’re apt to throw in a few self-inflicted ones. We may be trapped in a career maze, for example, obsessed with beating our office competitors to the next step in the career trajectory. And yet when we confuse happiness with success—at least the outward version of success, as represented by wealth, position, power, or fame—we all but guarantee that the various components of our life will be thrown out of joint (though the unbalancing process can be so insidious that we don’t realize what’s happening).",

      "title": "Superheroes and Transformers: Rethinking Teach for America's Leadership Models",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Many young children enjoy playing superheroes and Transformers. Often they can be found acting out fantasies in which they assume the identities of these all-powerful characters. The drama usually unfolds the same way: Villains use their power to abuse others until a bold, relentless protagonist uses novel talent and transformative strength to crush the evil forces. The hero/ine, motivated by a fierce sense of urgency, bravely resolves the victims' plights--often by blowing up things and leaving a path of destruction in his/her wake as he/she metes out justice and order. This pretend play carries several benefits during early childhood. Children can try different forms of power in both good and bad roles. They can develop social, emotional, cognitive, and physical skills. But these simplified tropes don't necessarily serve us well as adults seeking to solve complex social dilemmas. Without deliberation and cooperation, a focus on superhero solutions can minimize our attention to more nuanced human concerns. Worries over competition, valuing fierce individualism and dramatic results, and charismatic heroes can edge out considerations about empathy for others, civic awareness, collaboration, creativity, equity, and social justice. Nevertheless, our yearning for heroic leaders persists throughout society. Education is no exception. In fact, in our study of Teach For America (TFA), we found these themes of heroism and individualism repeating themselves among many TFA alumni and current corps members when they reflected on the educational leadership they deemed most desirable for redressing educational inequities. For our respondents, most of whom were on a professional fast track to become leaders themselves, the archetype of the valiant leader in a relentless pursuit of excellence and justice was by far the most frequently cited model of leadership. They were enchanted with the image of a morally virtuous, epic hero. Studying Teach For America In 1990, TFA began as an alternative teacher preparation and placement organization. Today its mission has shifted to building a movement to eliminate educational inequity by selecting and preparing our nation's most promising leaders. TFA has successfully seeded its leaders across a wide range of charter management organizations, school districts, corporate-funded education reform agencies, and government offices. Yet many of TFA's highest-profile leaders seem to stir up strong reactions from observers of all political persuasions. For three years, we've been researching TFA alumni and current members' notions about the leadership they believe could best increase educational equity. We've also talked with them about their diagnoses of educational inequality and ideas for policies that can effectively redress them. In this article, we report on what we found from one subset of our data, our interviews. In total, we interviewed a representative sample of 117 alumni and 47 current corps members, all of whom participated in the program between 1991 and 2013 and who worked in 25 different TFA placement regions across the country. The knowledge base on TFA Most literature on TFA falls into four general categories. The first, the conceptual debates, considers the most promising ways to prepare teachers to serve in hard-to-staff, under-resourced schools, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of relying on TFA teachers, most of whom are white and from elite backgrounds, to serve primarily children of color in low-income communities. Other literature investigates TFA's test-based effectiveness. This research tends to show that students of TFA teachers have mixed results, and the effects of these results are usually small. The third category contains journalistic and biographical narratives that detail corps members' conflicts and joys as novices working in communities in which they are usually professional and cultural outsiders. …",

      "abstract": "\"The Hungarians’ history is replete with painful episodes; as a consequence, a certain pessimistic outlook has been embedded into the Hungarian culture. The university is home now to students – future teachers of religion, future pastors – whose parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents lived and worked under the oppressive regime and who (also) for this reason approach the past in a rather nega-tive way. They lived for too long in silent despair, without joy, without sufficient food, in fear of informers who would anonymously give out anybody to the “au-thorities” in hope of personal advantages and rewards. This generation will proba-bly have a hard time believing that those horrible times can never return. This peri-od is also marked by the fact that these people, in most cases, had mind-numbing, treadmill-like, soul-crushing jobs. In these circumstances, nothing was prompting them to improve their performance, and they sooner or later resigned themselves to only meet the minimal expectations. They were not concerned with the future be-cause they did not hope that with a more purposeful attitude, with more efficient work their lot could be improved. On the other hand, their attitude towards the present had become more and more pessimistic. “Why even try if my life is con-trolled by forces on which I have no influence whatsoever?” This young generation of teachers/pastors has still heard too often the stories of the painful past and were in many cases eyewitnesses to their parents’ and grand-parents’ daily struggles or saw them surrender their future goals and become disillu-sioned with the future. During their training as teachers, the victim experience and pessimistic view-point (unconsciously) inherited from their forefathers quite often show up in the students’ decisions, in their reactions to certain professional or life situations, in their conflict management and coping methods. In this paper, we will first show the ideal attitude towards the past, the present, and the future, based on the theory presented by Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd, which leads to a much more balanced and happy life for individuals as well as at the level of nations. Then we will outline the reflection phase model based on the new insights, with the help of which, in our opinion, the attitude of the students at the Faculty of Reformed Theology towards the past, present, and future can be shaped in a positive direction. Keywords: teacher training, mindful, future-oriented perspective, progress towards the core, development of the ideal.\"",

      "title": "Why Children Talk to Themselves",
      "abstract": "If you could become the shadow of a 2- to 8-year-old, furtively tagging along as the child goes about his or her daily activities, you would notice a curious form of language behavior—remarks in which the child seems to talk to himself or herself or to no one in particular. This speech-to-self occurs frequently. It can surface in virtually any of the child’s pursuits—during fantasy play, drawing and painting, building with blocks, tackling academic tasks, idly passing the time of day, and quieting down before naptime or nightly sleep. Researchers call this spontaneous, self-directed talk private speech. Unlike adults, who self-consciously talk to themselves only in solitary moments, young children freely use private speech in public. So at ease are preschool and primary-school children in speaking to themselves in front of others that on observing this behavior, many adults question its normalcy! “Confused,” “touched,” and “strange” are among the descriptors I have heard them apply to self-talking children, generalizing from “crazy people,” who not only speak aloud to fantasized audiences but also act improperly in a great many ways because they are indifferent to their social surroundings. To be sure, talking to oneself in the midst of a roomful of people is not acceptable in the adult social world. Yet all of us engage in private speech from time to time. And it is ubiquitous in early childhood. When children between the ages of 3 and 10 are observed in classrooms, private speech makes up as much as 20 percent to 60 percent of their language. Why do young children engage in it so frequently? To grasp the significance of private speech in the life of the child, let’s begin by looking at it in ourselves. When are you most likely to talk out loud to yourself? In response to this question, most adults say they engage in audible self-talk when they face cognitive, emotional, or social challenges. Here are some self-reports: • “At the end of a busy day, when I’m tired and distracted, I sometimes find myself looking for an important document, for my keys, or even for where I parked my car.",

      "abstract": "The moment in which the traumatic mark is re-experienced is not normal time; time does not function as an expectable and reliable limit. Rather, time boundaries dissolve. In an effort to connect, they reinflict something on the parents, who unconsciously push the child aside along with the reopened traumatic experience, thus leaving the child to face something alone. Children born into such a family might come to see themselves as born to end their parents' suffering at the hands of previous generations. Without knowing it, they identify themselves with repairing trauma, which, ironically, compels them to try to discover the pain the parents are trying to put behind them. Ideological positions or values that a family uses to define \"who psychoanalyst are\" or to define their links to a larger group-for example, a political or religious organization-can become the vehicle for the trauma lesson.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : While each of us is undoubtedly aware of lapses in professional behavior, by ourselves and others, we should celebrate the daily observation of performance that reflects genuine commitment to traditional values, the actions of many people in uniform speak louder than words. People do, at least on occasion, give evidence that they can discriminate among value systems and that they can act in the interest of others even at some personal cost (while yet mistakenly claiming to agree with relativists and egoists who argue that this is not so). Clearing up the confusion can have important beneficial effects. It can reduce the temptation, when we are frustrated or disillusioned, to lower our personal standards and our expectations. It can also heighten our professional sense of self-worth by permitting us to take full credit for our dedication and self-sacrifice. We can respond with confidence to cynics and naysayers and can come to regard the profession's espousal of traditional values as noble yet realistic, demanding yet attainable.",

It may be inflicted on him by another character, who hits him or squashes him down (jack-in-the-box clowning) or throws something at him (custard-pie slapstick). Alternatively he may bring the experience on himself by his own clumsiness or stupidity, by putting on inappropriate clothes or by mishandling some physical object or by getting into a precarious location. The spectator laughs out of a sense of relief and superiority, because he is not in the uncomfortable situation himself. When the unpleasant experience is inflicted by another character, the spectator may feel a sense of identity with the aggressor, and so feel a release from the inhibitions which generally repress his own aggressiveness.",

      "abstract": "M Post of us believe that we have reasons to care about our own future selves and that these reasons differ, either in degree or in kind, from the reasons we have to act on behalf of one another. It is often assumed that an adequate account of personal identity should be able to explain-and perhaps also to justifythe sort of concern we have for our future selves. And this is thought to pose a special problem for psychological continuity accounts of personal identity-that is, for accounts which treat personal identity through time as consisting in some sort of continuity of experience rather than in the persistence of an irreducible subject such as an immaterial soul or a bare Cartesian ego. It is supposed to be obvious that I have special reasons to care about my future self if she has my immaterial soul in a way in which it is not obvious that I have special reasons to care about her if all she is is someone whose experiences are connected in certain ways to my present ones.. But this is far from obvious to me. In fact, my intuitions run the opposite way. I believe that I have special reasons to care about my future self if her experiences are connected in certain important ways to my present ones-if, for example, she will recall and carry out some of my present but future-directed intentions. And I doubt that I have any more reason to care about her than about anyone else, if her experiences are related to mine only in the sense that they belong to the same immaterial soul. But that may be because I assume that my soul-if I've got one-is no different from anyone else's except in so far as it has my experiences, memories, intentions and so on. Without these things, my soul is nothing to me. What follows is a defense of these intuitions-or at least of one of them. My primary aim is to argue that psychological continuity accounts of personal identity can explain, and in some sense justify, the sort of concern that each of us has for her own future selves. I will not argue that I have no reason to care about my future self if her experiences are related to mine only in the sense that they",

This is a relatively easy form of empathy, because who would not \nwant to empathize with those who are the victims of abuse by others, social \ncircumstances, illness, or fate? This easy empathy does important work in \nhelping us relate to characters and, by extension, helping us understand \nourselves and our relations with the world. But this is a non-threatening \nform of empathy that does not much challenge our view of ourselves. An \neasy empathy can actually make us complacent in that view, as we are reassured that we are the caring people we consider ourselves to be while we \nempathize with those who are suff ering or in less advantageous situations. \nOur identities are not challenged, nor are the privileges of empathy that rest \nwith the more powerful and more comfortable. Although there remains \nmuch value in this easy empathy-in empathy of any sort, really-my focus \nin this chapter is on a more diffi cult empathy that unsettles us and places \neasy empathy into question, showing us our vulnerabilities reﬂ ected in victims and our shared human capacity to victimize reﬂ ected in victimizers.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Responding to emerging need. Whatever stage of the bereavement process you are in, you can always seek online support. Many choose this style of therapy because grieving about their loved ones happens from the privacy of their own homes. One post on Facebook or Twitter can take the place of fifty or more conversations. You may have dreaded the thought of telling people over and over again about a death or how you are coping and social media gives you the opportunity to tell people all at once. Why say it yourself when you can tweet a beautiful quote that says it for you? Our aim is to develop an online support group, which will be run by trained bereavement volunteers. The Group aims will be to provide: • A chance for people to share their grief with other bereaved members. • A place for people to talk about their loved ones without feeling unwelcome or uncomfortable. • A safe place to post poetry, photographs, journals or articles about their loved one who has died. • An opportunity for people to meet locals who can offer support, many times people who meet online and live in the same area often get together. • A chance for people to feel less lonely in their grief. • A place for people to learn coping skills, stress management techniques and ways to relax. • Advice and information following bereavement. <h3>Methods</h3> During initial assessment for bereavement support patients will be provided with a 'Online Bereavement Group' leaflet which will provide details including. How do I join the group? How might the group offer support? And Confidentiality and record keeping. Once a member of the group, patients will be supported by other online members and bereavement volunteers.",

If we do not look the part and fit in with our peers we may feel rejected and lonely, both in the social world and on the job scene. Any spots and blemishes may leave us feeling conspicuous and embarrassed, particularly if they are on exposed areas such as the face.",

With unanswered questions and hovering guilt, a young woman comes to confront the specters of her past through dialogue with an unexpected companion. This process is as uncomfortable as it is transformative. Freedom is discovered not by eliminating life's loose ends nor running away from them, but in gathering them bravely and continuing to put one foot in front of the other despite everything--a process made hopeful in the solidarity of unexpected friendship.",

Questions that tease the mind into imagining—and reading—lives on other pages. Granted, some people are snapshots , diminished by irony. The twoyear -old who senses that he has lost control of the big people around him; the four-year-old trying to create order in the small world of his toys.

Other characters, thankfully, not so stopped. Some making peace through faith, the saving pleasure of a memory, to create as well as fading senses allow, to joke against eternity. The woman who hides her hands, after decades of service, hands that must surely be works of art to God; another who “just knows now that even God has his flaws.” A certain sadness comes through. Often, the characters seem isolated, contained within themselves. If they connect, it’s because they remind the reader of certain moments of self-reflection. Dialogue is rare. Community, if mentioned, is usually a context; contributing to, creating community seems secondary. A man who finds “friendship . . . from the ashes of two different desperations,” a welcome reprieve.

The poems are not always finished or polished, standing as they do for incomplete lives. A dark textured cover takes and holds our fingerprints. W. M. Hagen Oklahoma Baptist University Kaaron Warren Into Bones Like Oil Atlanta. Meerkat Press. 2019. 100 pages. KAARON WARREN RELIVES her fascination with ghosts and, like every great writer, steals her stories from the everyday. But nothing is everyday in where she takes you. Into Bones Like Oil is a nonimposing story that is a big haunting for the unsettling themes it explores. In the gentle ticking of a clock, the silent roll of a sea, the narrative invites us into protagonist Dora’s solitude. The story discloses a mother’s guilt. We are trapped with Dora inside a shipwrecked house and its shipwrecked occupants, and all its visiting ghosts. As in such (multi) award-winning works as Tide of Stone (2018) and The Grief Hole (2016), Warren lulls you with deceptively simple text into a complex oddity, where all characters are nearly appealing in their flaws. Like Trevor, who is handsome in an immature way; short and bouncy, he’s like a little Fluffy. Like ex-sailor Luke, easy on the eye, so full of secrets. Like big Larry, so strong, his handshake could break bone. Like Roy, with the skin disease, the landlord who lures specters, who takes advantage of sleepers—conduits to ghosts and their stories. Warren enchants you with what she tells, what she doesn’t tell. There is an omnipresent suspense inside a vivid sense of place, a most gloomy place: “The bathroom was tiled, floor and walls, in pale purple with gold streaks. It gave the room an odd glow, because the light fitting was set high in the ceiling and dim due to dust and insects in the pale green glass globe. The toilet was old but clean.” There are smells everywhere: wet hair, hot metal, musk. And sound: feet, cars, the tick tock of an unseen clock. The prose is quietly ruthless. A reveal about something dreadful, like an infant torn live from a hung woman’s belly, falls out of a normal conversation about something else. There is almost a monotony to the story, yet just as you relax there are shadows of people in the room. Into Bones Like Oil is Kaaron Warren in her element. Her summons into a wine bar of sorts. For ghosts. Shipwrecked ones. And nothing is innocent. Not even you. Eugen Bacon Swinburne University of Technology Rodrigo Márquez Tizano Jakarta Trans. Thomas Bunstead. Minneapolis.

      "abstract": "Named one of 100 Leadership & Success Books to Read in a Lifetime by Amazon Editors Confronted by omnipresent threats of job loss and change, even the brightest among us are anxious. In response, we're hunkering down, blocking ourselves from new challenges. This response hurts us and our organizations, but we fear making ourselves even more vulnerable by committing mistakes while learning something new. In Flying Without a Net, Thomas DeLong explains how to draw strength from vulnerability. First, understand the forces that escalate anxiety in high achievers and the unproductive behaviors you turn to for relief. Then adopt practices that give you the courage to do the right things poorly before doing the right things well. Drawing on his extensive research and consulting work, DeLong lays out: - Roots of high achievers' anxiety: fear of being wrong and lack of a sense of purpose, and a craving for human connection - Destructive behaviors we adopt to relieve our anxiety: busyness, comparing ourselves to others, and blaming others for our frustrations - Behaviors we must adopt to gain strength from vulnerability: putting the past behind us and seeking honest feedback Packed with practical advice and inspiring stories, Flying Without a Net is an invaluable resource for all leaders seeking to thrive in this Age of Anxiety.",

      "title": "Micro-retirement: A Philosophical Approach To Pause With Purpose As The Pursuit Of Eudaemonia",
      "abstract": "Stress is one of the common problems in today’s world, particularly in the workplace, where demanding tasks and deadlines can negatively impact people’s emotional and physical well-being. Many people put off their personal happiness and fulfilment in the hopes of achieving success in the future. It is believed that one can only truly enjoy life after becoming wealthy or by retiring, frequently ignoring the uncertainties of life and the demands of contemporary workplaces. People bear risk of jeopardizing their wellbeing when they choose to live in the present over an uncertain future. The aim of this research paper is to examine the idea of micro-retirement, which is the practice of taking short, deliberate pauses in one’s work that can last for a few months to a few years in order to prioritize moral and personal development. These pauses are not meant to be idle; rather, they are thoughtfully planned to live a satisfactory life. Micro-retirement allows people to reconsider their life goals by stepping back from the responsibilities of their careers. Aristotle’s concept of eudaimonia is a major area of interest for this research. Human flourishing, or eudaimonia, is about leading a life that is meaningful. Those who take these intentional pauses can attain eudaimonia. Furthermore, existentialist philosophy emphasizes how each person shapes their own life, as expressed by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. In the context of micro-retirement, existentialism suggests that people can reclaim their life and make sincere choices about their time management by purposefully taking a break from work. This freedom from social pressures makes it possible to experience deep self-discovery. The practical and ethical implications of micro-retirement are examined through informative discussions with professionals in organizational behaviour and financial planning, with an emphasis on the potential benefits for both workers and companies, as well as the ethical duties of employers to encourage such efforts. This research suggests that micro-retirement offers a viable solution to the problems of contemporary life by analyzing the connection between stress, workplace culture and personal fulfilment.",

      "title": "Aging as Readiness and Wariness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gerontology concerns itself with events in time, either things that have happened or things that may happen. In the former, our work is to describe and explain. In the latter, the occurrence of events is unknowable, but we can nonetheless study people’s imagination of them (how it arises) and how that imagination shapes behavior and attitudes in the present (how it matters). The subjective experience of aging, thus, is one of looking ever forward—welcoming, waiting for, or hoping to avoid what the future may hold. This personal experience of aging toggles between readiness and wariness of the time ahead, one stance incurring or else eclipsing the other. Transitions are fruitful opportunities to study people’s readiness and wariness toward the time ahead, for example, widowhood, the prospect of retirement, and residential relocation. This is when people are more likely to conjure, in their minds, whom they may become. Arguably, the fundamental transition that looms and occupies aging minds (and the minds of loved ones) is not death but rather the potential passage into the “fourth age” of frailty and vulnerability. This prospect hovers above all else: its occurrence increasingly likely but its timing uncertain. About this prospect, gerontology has the capacity, nay the obligation, to promote narratives about later life that shape wariness and readiness for the practical future (e.g., financial matters, bodily care, living arrangements) as well as for the emotional reception of an old age coming ever closer.",

      "title": "Victims of Disasters: Helping People Recover—From Acute Distress to Healing and Integration",
      "abstract": "When disasters strike they are sudden, unexpected, and “earth-shattering” to those affected by them. Often those who are exposed directly talk about how their lives of relative tranquility before the disaster has been radically changed, and how peace of mind has evaporated and replaced by worry and catastrophic expectations. They describe their new post-disaster reality as living life “upside down,” in a state of confusion, and pervasive anxiety, and helplessness. Disasters are generally defined as mass environmental stress affecting a large number of people. Terrorism, like no other mass disaster event, smashes to smithereens a victim’s sense of normality and reality, while eroding the sense of safety and general well-being. Disaster victims also speak about things not being the same, of how their inner sense of safety and the ability to count on the stability of the environment (for even a modicum of predictability) has been lost. Some also speak about feeling powerless, having lost the structure of their daily lives and associated routines, and about the collective emotional distress caused by the abrupt depletion of resources and altered physical environments. The contents of this article is based on: (1) the author’s over two decades of clinical, consultative, scientific, instructional, and administrative expertise in the area of traumatic stress, (2) the author’s direct professional activities with victims of disasters, to include the September 11 attack by terrorists on the World Trade Center in New York City during seven trips to the City beginning October 10, 2001, and (3) knowledge gleaned from decades of clinical and field studies on specific disasters in the United States and in many countries of the world. Specifically, the author has participated in helping victims exposed to the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989 in northern California, the Perryville Explosion of 1991 in Perryville, Maryland, the Oklahoma City Bombing of 1995, the Polish Flood of 1996, Hurricane Floyd of 1999, and the World Trade Center (WTC) attack of September 11, 2001.",

During the first five days of the war, when there were the most dead, no news of this kind came through. Later the fallen were buried temporarily near the fronts; only much later did they get a permanent burial. A young secretary, herself a war widow, noted down the main ideas of what was said in the group with full knowledge and consent of the participants.

      "title": "Crises and Opportunities: The Analysis of an Autobiographical Account of Bereavement and Growth",
      "abstract": "From the moment they occur, crisis events involving personal loss can disrupt people's lives and irrevocably change how they engage with the world. Living with the crisis of irreplaceable loss in a world that has suddenly become unfamiliar and unpredictable is both existentially and psychologically challenging. In the aftermath of crisis, how does the survivor go about relearning his existence and incorporating the inconceivable into a newly emerging view of the world? In Western society it is quite common for individuals and groups to report that their experiences of powerfully disturbing crisis events have created a set of conditions that forced them to make significant personal changes which resulted in beneficial growth. Thus, in such crises, the survivor may oscillate between emotional distress and a fuller knowledge of reality, the questioning of old core beliefs and goals and the establishment of new ones, holding on to their past self-narrative and the creation and integration of a new one, whilst attempting to maintain psychic and physical balance. This oscillation gently accommodates the pre-crisis elements of the survivor's whole experience and enables the possibility of movement toward continuing future growth and the recognition and use of opportunities. In the last decade or so, mirroring the trend to positively reframe these disrupting states, crisis and bereavement work has become increasingly interested in those outcomes that suggest: enhanced psychological well-being and health; personal and spiritual development and increased coping skills; and, improved relationships and enhanced personal resources. In this brief chapter, an autobiographical account of loss is given to demonstrate how exposure to crisis can provide opportunity for significant personal transformation. The analysis uses the integrated conceptual frameworks of Lawrence Calhoun and Richard Tedeschi's post-traumatic growth model and Stanislav and Christina Grof's psycho-spiritual paradigm, blended with some current ideas about crisis, grief and bereavement.",

      "title": "What to Do When Your Paper Is Rejected",
      "abstract": "Rejection happens to all of us, and it can be a salutatory experience. In the case of submitted papers, authors who are early, as well as those established in their careers, will experience rejection. In response to a rejection letter, one should not react by ripping the letter to shreds or, in today's electronic world, permanently deleting the message. Similarly, one should avoid the decision never to write another paper. Many papers originally rejected may ultimately find a home, with rewrites or better targeting to a more suitable journal. This article will explore feasible options for writers eager for their papers to find such a home.First and foremost, deal with your feelings. Although it never is easy to take, rejection is particularly hard at the beginning of your career. It is best to identify your emotions and employ your best coping mechanisms: relax with your favorite tea or coffee, vent to your friends or family, exercise, or get a hug from your kids. After you have achieved a calm frame of mind, you are ready to rationally evaluate why your paper was not accepted. Hopefully, over time, this first step becomes automatic and you regain equilibrium swiftly.The rejection letter should be read as carefully as instructions to cash in a winning lottery ticket. Never skim or read only the punch line (reject). It is surprising how many authors direct questions to me that have been explicitly answered in the rejection letter. It can be helpful for a colleague to read the letter if it appears confusing or unhelpful. As the number of submissions to journals rise—despite the exponential increase in the number of online and print journals1—more papers are rejected \"internally\" without external peer review. In this case, 1 or more journal editors will review the paper to determine relevance for the journal audience, balance with recent or upcoming accepted papers, and overall quality. Papers that do not pass this initial filter will be rejected without further review. Journals differ in the amount of information that is provided to the authors regarding the reasons for rejection. Some clinical journals do not provide any additional information. Many medical education journals, including the Journal of Graduate Medical Education (JGME), will provide a short explanation. Review these comments carefully because they should provide helpful advice as to next steps.Papers that pass this initial filter will be sent for peer review. Papers that are rejected after peer review usually have detailed comments about the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as perceived by the reviewers. Editors may add additional summary comments that relate to the paper's relevance to the journal's audience, study validity, and overall importance in moving the field forward. This information is often extremely valuable for improving the paper or planning future projects.2–4 Before asking for additional feedback from the journal editors, digest these comments thoroughly.Finally, the peer review process has flaws. Editors strive for fairness and weed out reviewers who deliver inappropriate or harsh comments. Studies, most focused on biomedical research, have determined various problems with the peer review system; yet, the system appears to be the best available at this time.5–7In the review process for many journals, papers that do not follow the author instructions carefully in terms of format, word count, number of figures and tables, and reference style will be rejected immediately. As author instructions continue to expand, they are not as \"author-friendly\" as one would wish. Despite their complexity, author instructions must be carefully followed; any deviance must be addressed clearly in the cover letter to the journal editors. Some journals will review papers that do not fit the prescribed format if there is a cover letter establishing the reason for the deviations; it is prudent to correspond separately with the journal office for these types of submissions. Usually, JGME avoids an initial rejection by requesting authors to resubmit their manuscript with the correct format or word count. Submitting a paper that does not follow author instructions risks annoying the journal editors and delaying the review of your paper. Thus, following author instructions exactly is your best strategy.A common reason for internal rejection of submitted papers is a mismatch between the paper and the scope of the journal, which is closely related to the journal's target audience. Although the title of a journal gives some information regarding its scope, more will be found on its website. There are at least 99 health professions education journals, in print and online, with a considerable degree of overlap in mission and scope. A perusal of 1 or 2 journal issues will enlighten authors as to the most common themes, research designs, and authors. Thus, reviewing a few journal issues for content and format, before submitting your paper, is highly recommended. In addition, websites exist that attempt to match article title, key words, or abstract to a particular journal.For example, if I type in \"Publishing Your Medical Education Research Projects\" into Jane—the Journal/Author Name Estimator—website (http://www.biosemantics.org/jane), I can search by journals, authors, or articles found in MEDLINE.8 Searching by \"journals\" produces a long list of potential journals as well as articles on this topic. My test yields Medical Teacher (No. 1), Academic Medicine (No. 3), Journal of Surgical Education (No. 8), and many others. Inserting your abstract or key words generates a better match with journals. If the first journal you chose rejected your paper on the grounds of a \"poor fit,\" with better targeting, your manuscript may find a home.Quantitative papers that explore a new educational intervention are often limited by the small \"n\" of subjects under study. Many of the populations we study—faculty, residents, students—are limited naturally, and we cannot recruit for additional subjects, as can be done in clinical trials. When an association between the outcomes of interest and the intervention is not found, the association may indeed exist. However, the sample size may have been too small to find an association (a type II error). With small sample sizes, all other things being equal, an association is found only when the effect size (size of the impact) is very large. Small samples will also greatly limit generalizability. These types of small \"n\" studies often fail to move the field forward because few credible conclusions can be drawn. However, collecting data on additional subjects, for example by repeating the intervention over multiple years, may yield more illuminating and credible results.Often, investigators implement a new educational intervention as a pilot, to determine whether residents or faculty will find the experience enjoyable and to ensure the costs in time, effort, and materials are generally worthwhile. The first participants may be volunteers or represent a \"convenience sample,\" in that they were available at the same time as the investigators needed subjects. This is a common and useful start, but selection bias may limit conclusions. However, negative findings can be important. If volunteer participants strongly dislike an intervention, it is unlikely to be accepted by a larger, more representative group, no matter how effective. Similarly, overly burdensome interventions may not be implemented without considerable modifications. Unless entirely novel, small pilot studies of this type are unlikely to provide guidance to others interested in the topic, and papers about those studies are more likely to be rejected.The next step after a pilot run should be a more robust investigation of the intervention. Being more robust means larger numbers of participants, less selection bias in participants to improve generalizability, use of a reasonable comparison group that receives a different intervention, outcomes that go beyond self-assessment by participants and feasibility, and sustained outcomes, measured at some distance from the intervention. With information gleaned from the pilot project, investigators will be better able to lobby supervisors for time, estimate a meaningful effect size to calculate minimum sample size, determine credible yet practical outcome measures, and plan how and when to follow up with participants for sustained outcomes. Regardless of whether associations with outcomes of interest are found, this more robust study is likely to be helpful to others outside your institution, and thus, the report on these studies is more likely to be accepted for publication.Occasionally, reviewers will suggest a qualitative study as the first step in untangling confusing research questions or findings. Although generalizability outside the group studied is a limitation, qualitative research studies can provide answers to the key question \"why?\" and are critical to understanding how learners learn. Many medical education researchers are unfamiliar with the methodology and terminology of qualitative research.9–13 There may be experienced individuals at your institution or affiliated with your national society who would be delighted to share their expertise and join your investigating team. Before starting another quantitative study, consider whether qualitative approaches would inform the topic, particularly if the reviewers have suggested this may be valuable. Fortunately, qualitative studies require little funding for equipment or materials, although they will entail investigator time.A sidebar is needed here. Qualitative approaches are rigorous and must be detailed in the Methods section of a paper such that others could replicate the same steps: an exact recipe, similar to the description of quantitative research steps. Feedback from participants, which has been reviewed and summarized by the authors, is not qualitative research and the word \"qualitative\" should not be employed to describe the results.If the problems cited in the rejection letter refer to steps or results that you have done but, for some reason, were omitted from your paper, you may be able to resubmit your manuscript with the missing methods or data. It is best to check with the journal office first. Alternately, the reviews may suggest a different category for your manuscript. This will involve a complete rewrite of the paper to fit the author instructions for the new category. Before revising your paper to fit a different article category, consider whether another journal, with a different scope or target audience, is a better choice.Editors laugh when they receive a cover letter addressed to another journal—yes, this happens—and it is not the best way to announce your paper. No 2 journals have the same author instructions or format, and some revisions will be needed before you submit your paper to another journal. Not infrequently, the same reviewers may be requested to peruse your paper for the new journal. Thus, it is imperative to make all appropriate changes using the feedback already provided in the initial review. When you cannot make a substantial change—such as collection of new data—requested by the initial reviewers, it may be prudent to include your rationale in your cover letter or in a supplemental appendix to the paper for the second journal. A few medical education journals request information regarding any prior submissions and copies of all reviews your paper previously received. If this information is not provided accurately, the paper is rejected. However, most journals do not require details about the history of your orphan paper.Editors are pleased to receive a manuscript that has been previously reviewed and revised because the paper is usually in better shape overall: more concise and clear. Use all the valuable feedback you have received from the first reviews, target your paper to the most suitable journal, and release your paper to find a good home.All of us receive rejection letters for submitted articles. Usually several individuals with expertise in the topic have donated substantial time to provide detailed advice to advance your paper and future work. Use this feedback to improve your paper for submission to another journal as well as your next, more robust study of the topic. Consider volunteering to 1 or more journals to review papers, both as a good citizen of the medical education world and to improve your own editing skills.14 Above all, do not stop pondering and studying medical education topics, or writing papers.",

      "abstract": "Many amateur sportsmen in the West, have today started undertaking long and intensive ordeals where their personal capacity to withstand increasing suffering is the prime objective. Running, jogging, triathlon and trekking, etc., are the sorts of ordeal where people without any particular ability are not pitting themselves against others, but are committed to testing their own capacity to withstand increasing pain. Constantly called upon to prove themselves in a society where reference points are both countless and contradictory and where values are in crisis, people are now seeking a one-to-one relationship by radical means, testing their strength of character, their courage and their personal resources. Going right on to the end of a self-imposed ordeal gives a legitimacy to life and provides a symbolic plank that supports them. Performance itself is of secondary significance; it is has a value only to the individual. There is no struggle against a third party, only a method for reinforcing personal will-power and overcoming suffering by going right to the limit of a personally-imposed demand. The physical limit has come to replace the moral limit that present-day society is failing to provide. Overcoming suffering tempers the individual, providing a renewed significance and value to his life",

Such individual will often risk anything to escape, even if it means going without a paycheck to fuel their entrepreneurial dreams. For these people there are no rules, and it's difficult for them to embrace the team concept. These are the people who think differently and break the rules because they have found through life experience that their ideas were better than others most of the time. Such people are the brilliant thinkers who are used to getting things done better and possibly even faster without a team behind them. This chapter highlights the leaders who harness such individualistic thinkers and shepherd them in the right direction instead of slapping their wrists for breaking the rules.",

We can stay more or less as we are, we can go back to an earlier state of affairs, we can change a bit or we can change a lot.

When is a change a small one and when is it a large one? Are we talking of the near future (say, the next five years), the medium term (twenty-five years) or the long term (a century or more)?",

All the way from childhood, it was my experience that there were certain subjects that you just didn't talk about; that .. . that . .. somehow you handled your feelings about these things internally in your own private way. And a lot of the writing I did as a young person had to do with this-I started writing when I was ten or eleven years old-and I think that my journals, my diaries, my poems were ways that I addressed the things that I couldn't talk about in my everyday relationships. My parents were in the process of divorcing; my grandmother on whom I was very dependent died. My feelingsespecially of grief, anger, and fear-were as real as, maybe more real than, my relationships. I felt that I had to give some kind of shape to them; that unless I could put my feelings into a shape and find a space for them, that somehow I couldn't . . . I don't know, it was almost like I couldn't continue to live. I didn't show these journals to anybody, because I knew there were things in them that most people didn't want to hear. . . I mean. . . when I was very young I was writing about death. My grandparents owned a funeral home; they lived on top, and often when I stayed overnight, there'd be bodies downstairs. I was three, four, five years old and my grandparents were as casual as if they had owned a grocery store. I'd answer the phone if they were busy, and show visitors in. I was in Catholic school and there was an abundance of images of death and punishment everywhere -the crucifixion, saints, martyrs, in the Old Testament stories and the prayers of the Mass. Often I'd pray over the bodies. It terrified me that they didn't move, that I could touch them and their hands would be so hard. Especially I was disturbed when young people died, children, babies. Years later I asked my mother why she let me go downstairs alone and she said she thought I wasn't afraid and she didn't want to scare me. As I said, there were so many things",

La vida seria probablemente mas placentera si no tuvieramos que afrontar repetidamente el �problema de manana�. Las ilusiones subyacentes a esta perspectiva del manana son que �mas tarde sera mejor� y que las acciones evitadas se encontraran hechas magicamente o habran desaparecido. Estas ilusiones tienen consecuencias frustrantes. La gente que pospone en exceso tiende a la culpa, auto-decadencia, ansiedad, y al sentimiento interferidor de impotencia. El habito de posponer no es un problema trivial. En el extremo moderado de la escala, posponer refleja una caprichosa manera de ser que aparece en diferentes momentos, en medio de acciones cumplidas a tiempo. En el otro extremo, uno puede sentirse atrapado en el pozo del aplazamiento, dando vueltas, sin llegar rapido a ningun sitio. \nEn este articulo revisaremos las siguientes cuestiones:\n1.- ?Que es el habito de posponer?\n2.- ?Cual es la causa del habito de posponer?\n3.- ?Porque nos resistimos al cambio?\n4.- ?Como detener el habito de posponer?",

      "title": "(Un)doing gender : ways of being in an age of uncertainty",
      "abstract": "Children’s literature has conventionally and historically been concerned with identity and the often tortuous journey to becoming a subject who is generally older and wiser, a journey typically characterised by mishap, adventure, and detours. Narrative closure in children’s and young adult novels and films typically provides a point of self-realisation or self-actualisation, whereby the struggles of finding one’s “true” identity have been overcome. In this familiar coming-of-age narrative, there is often an underlying premise of an essential self that will emerge or be uncovered. This kind of narrative resolution provides readers with a reassurance that things will work for the best in the end, which is an enduring feature of children’s literature, and part of liberal-humanism’s project of harmonious individuality. However, uncertainty is a constant that has always characterised the ways lives are lived, regardless of best-laid plans. Children’s literature provides a field of narrative knowledge whereby readers gain impressions of childhood and adolescence, or more specifically, knowledge of ways of being at a time in life, which is marked by uncertainty. Despite the prevalence of children’s texts which continue to offer normative ways of being, in particular, normative forms of gender behaviour, there are texts which resist the pull for characters to be “like everyone else” by exploring alternative subjectivities. Fiction, however, cannot be regarded as a source of evidence about the material realities of life, as its strength lies in its affective and imaginative dimensions, which nevertheless can offer readers moments of reflection, recognition, or, in some cases, reality lessons. As a form of cultural production, contemporary children’s literature is highly responsive to social change and political debates, and is crucially implicated in shaping the values, attitudes and behaviours of children and young people.",

Dear reader, approach this piece with compassion and care. Seek the support and care you require—ideally on your terms and in a community of care. In this relational meditation, I offer a performative response to Alexander Baril’s (2020) “suicidal manifesto” in the hopes of “building relations with suicidal people” (sec. 2.3.2, para. 2). Of the current crises we are navigating, suicidality persists. Be it through the recent loss of a dear queer mentor and friend to suicide, the suicidal student whose means of relating evade the violence of mandated reporting over mandated care, or the mundane suicidal ebbs and flows that have long organized my own lived experience, suicidality is a fact of my life and I would venture to suggest yours as well. I performatively engage Baril’s “critical suicidality” in the hopes of inviting further and even more complex dialogues around mental health, wellness, and suicidality free of stigma and shame. While we theorize, organize, and perform means by which to survive our current crises, destigmatizing suicidality must be of paramount importance.

Perhaps nowhere have these calls for empathy been more visible than in former US President Barack Obama's warning that the United States is undergoing an \"empathy deficit\" which needs to be urgently solved. This chapter examines the ways in which empathy enables us to understand, imagine, and create otherness, particularly in instances when the other may not be directly perceivable and indeed radically different from one's self, such as in the case of a fictional character, an animal, or a robot. Otherness and the imagination are intrinsic to any debate on empathy. The chapter also presents an overview on the key concepts discussed in this book.",

This act of seeking makes the on-going, existential life journey an educational commitment; a continuing involvement with both abstract ideas and concrete reality. Age dims the eyes, not visionary possibilities; slows the reflexes, not the reflective skill that helps define the person as a thinking, questioning, questing being. For the adult learner who views life as an adventurous experiment with possibility, “being educated” is not seen as a completed accomplishment, but rather as a transformative journey. One way to reshape one’s perceptions, one’s thoughts, one’s ideas, and ultimately one’s self, is to choose a vicarious mentor; a person whose life, writings, and prophetic spirit may be tapped-into as a possibility to inspire, challenge, and raise questions about those big issues of life which have the power to define who we are. There are many such possibilities for this on-going intellectual dialogue. The choice made here is W.E.B. Du Bois.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An exploration into the phenomenology of existential wonder invites reflection upon life, self and other. Wonder suspends our habitual views of things, revealing them in a 'new light', and as a consequence, propels us into, and establishes anew, our relations with the world/other. Moreover, by bringing us to a conceptual 'stand‐still' wonder exposes our vulnerability, thereby putting into question the nature of identity. Attentiveness to wonder, and to the many dimensions of experience it reveals in our lives, can cultivate a sensitivity to the emergence of wonder in others, and therefore, has significant implications for the way in which we can be pedagogically oriented towards students. Rather than see a child's question as something that needs a quick and simple answer, the adult should try to help in his or her natural inclination to live the question. I wonder why the sun is so hot? I wonder how the earth was made? I wonder where I came from? I wonder why the leaves turn colour and fall off trees? Each of these questions is worth pausing for. True wonderment does not ask a thousand questions. I truly wonder when the question I ask is returned to me somehow, or when it lingers and envelopes itself with a stillness, the stillness of wonder, (van Manen 1986: 40‐41) Additional informationNotes on contributorsPhilo H HovePhilo Hove is a lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies, University of Calgary, and in the Department of Humanities, Mount Royal College, Calgary, Alberta.

      "title": "Brief encounters: delayed closure as a social art practice",
      "abstract": "Often an unfinished or incomplete work is regarded with varying degrees of scepticism and even negativity to a certain extent - as if inconclusiveness somehow equates with failure, and the complete connected with success. On the other hand an unfinished object may also be seen as ‘invitational’ e.g. a door not having been given an attractive surface appearance in the final stage of manufacture as the item may be supplied unfinished for you to paint yourself! \r\n\r\nThe unfinished work maintains a provisional relationship to its surroundings - to its present. There are many historical examples of works of art, literature, music, film and architecture that have been left unfinished and often the hand of fate has played a key role in this. However, an artwork that is unfinished through a deliberate artistic strategy speaks to our condition as humans and preserves an experimental ‘laboratory’ feel that is essential to its interpretation and appreciation. The work or object in this condition delays closure – it speaks about what is not there and in so doing conjures a dialogue with what is actually present. The deliberately unfinished work can on the one hand be seen to encourage anticipation, hopes and dreams - a more open, inventive, participatory plurality of voices, and on the other hand unrealised dreams. Whichever end of the scale you subscribe to, the unfinished work amounts to a proposition to engage in the work productively - in its potential future(s) - and situates those encountering the work in the present - in what Benjamin calls ‘the time of the now’. Rather than focussing [yet again] on failed utopias or abandoned hope this paper will focus on a year-long residency, including a series of micro engagements undertaken by this artist-presenter at ‘x-church’ in the UK, and will provide practical examples of current artistic research in the form of the unfinished project as a strategic mode of engagement and renewal. The project seeks to showcase contemporary artworks and practices that speak to a ‘lasting and immaculate present’ through the unfinished.",

So, love may arise at the moment we feel that there is a mysterious need to converge in search of the existed being that we can focus or lean upon to realize that happiness is to be close with the other that dwells in the very deep of ourselves.Love: is a great human need that equates in its concept the meaning of life, and thus there are may multiple aspects of love and its types depending on the different stages that a person goes through during his life, in addition to the different surrounding circumstances he experience since his childhood, for example a person begins his love in life for his parents and attachment with them, after that arises brotherly love with his friends, then love with different sex.Therefore, we will first talk about love, its concept and its ranks, then further work papers will follow on the rest of that concept, then we will talk later about hate.",

      "title": "Hope Under Oppression",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book explores the nature, value, and role of hope in human life under conditions of oppression. Oppression is often a threat and damage to hope, yet many members of oppressed groups, including prominent activists pursuing a more just world, find hope valuable and even essential to their personal and political lives. This book offers a unique evaluative framework for hope that captures the intrinsic value of hope for many of us, the rationality and morality of hope, and ultimately how we can hope well in the non-ideal world we share. It develops an account of the relationship between hope and anger about oppression and argues that anger tends to be accompanied by hopes for repair. When people’s hopes for repair are not realized, as is often the case for those who are oppressed, anger can evolve into bitterness: a form of unresolved anger involving a loss of hope that injustice will be sufficiently acknowledged and addressed. But even when all hope might seem lost or out of reach, faith can enable resilience in the face of oppression. Spiritual faith, faith in humanity, and moral faith are part of what motivates people to join in solidarity against injustice, through which hope can be recovered collectively. Joining with others who share one’s experiences or commitments for a better world and uniting with them in collective action can restore and strengthen hope for the future when hope might otherwise be lost.",

      "abstract": "“I’m going out and you can't stop me!” “I’ll spend my money on whatever I like!” “I’ll go out with whoever I want!” These are all statements we have heard from children and young people. We probably said the very same words to our own parents or carers. Adults so often interpret these statements as a reflection of rebellious and impossible behaviours at worst, or expression of a grab for independence at best . . . or you might have reacted differently . . . but did you? Western societies value the notion of independence, associating the concept with choice and competency, but also with freedom and rights. As parents and carers of young people we want them to grow to adulthood and be able to exercise agency in the world, but do we ever prepare them for the ‘real’ world – one of complex interdependency in which virtually every action, every choice, every consequence and even a sense of self depends on others?",

      "title": "Mir grauet vor der Götter Neide - Der Neid der Eltern in Fallbeispielen und Literatur",
      "abstract": "In several psychoanalytic treatments during my training, I came across the fact that patients were inhibited in their own development because, among other reasons, they unconsciously feared the envy of a parent (usually the same sex) or even both parents. Also parents were not aware of their envy, which is quite explicable with reference to our prevailing ideas of a parent: parents in German families are supposed to have solely good intentions regarding their children and they only want the \"Best\" for them. Envy in the sense of \"not allowing anything to anyone\" would be downright contrary to our popular understanding of parenting and thus something of which a father or mother should be ashamed. Several discussions with training colleagues and friends have shown that parents of my generation (post-war, I was born in 1951) certainly had to face heavy inner conflicts in this respect, but these conflicts mostly remained unconscious. When we were born, our parents had lived through a late adolescence with war and displacement, that is fear of death, struggle for survival, hunger, many years of hardships and heavy losses, and, under certain circumstances, trauma as well. On top of that, they had the oppressive feeling to have been blinded and abused as a teenager and that it is ultimately all their \"own fault\". It is hard to imagine how this generation of parents might have felt seeing their own children growing up in peace and relative prosperity, practicing “inacceptable” freedoms. In addition, my generation confronted their parents in a way those parents would have never been able to do in their youth and we accused them for having followed the Nazi regime. First, I will outline a few cases that have impressed me in my clinical practice and then I will look at the parents’ envy in popular psychological literature, in fiction and in fairy tales. Thereafter, I will give a summary of my own psychoanalytic perspective of envy itself. Then I deal with some studies in which I found the authors in fact considering envy in parents. The penultimate section deals with the \"slightly different\" view of the myth of Oedipus and the oedipal crisis. The last section reflects a more recent contribution to a kind of envy that is important for my own professional group: the therapist‘s envy experiencing the patient’s positive development or seeing a patient being better off in some important aspects of life.",

A measure of confidence does indeed come with experience. Presenting one's original creative work to critical scrutiny at any age requires courage. To be happy in one's personal life is crucial.

When we are willing to be vulnerable and open, to learn from others, and share our successes, not for praise, but in the interest of others achieving similar success, we are truly leading with purpose. I have learnt when we honour the human being in front of us in every moment, we build bridges, relationships, stronger capacity to communicate, better listening, we express compassion, and show dignity and respect.

The analysand needed to know whether she could reinvent her life, after one of its lengthiest and most complex phases had ended. The analyst decided to turn away from a primary focus on the therapeutic other in order to commit herself to being alive with more pleasure. The analysand decided that she did not need to go back in order to move forward. For both, it was the formation of a new relationship in the last third of life that created the environment for mutual recognition and libratory self-discovery.",

      "abstract": "How can we possibly be great parents, spouses, and friends; contribute effectively to our chosen profession; AND seek few elusive moments within long and stressful day to find time? Achieving and maintaining state of equilibrium in our quest to balance our responsibilities of family and career can be an overwhelming and draining task-if not perceived to be insurmountable. Beyond our daily family and career oriented tasks are the unscheduled time-depleting occurrences which can include things such as road closures, empty gas tanks (usually caused by someone in your family other than yourself), and searching for that one missing sock that your five year-old daughter must have for her first day of Kindergarten. These occurrences usually happen at the beginning of your day as you struggle to get to work on time or make that important meeting for which you are expected to actively participate or present recommendation. Then, once you finally get to work, your thoughtful spouse may send you text (of all things) informing you that you have to pickup your children from soccer and golf practice in different locations acrosstown... AFTER WORK-so don't be late! Are you kidding me? What about dinner? This scenario doesn't even begin to adequately describe the excessive, stressful, and uncontrollable work demands placed upon us, such as abstract major-project details, declining budgets, deadlines coupled with unclear expectations, and limited rewards and recognition for job well done. Failure to take step back and critically evaluating our work, family, and life demands may lead to burnout. Maslach and Jackson (1981), in Croom (2003, p. 1), defined burnout as, a condition characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and loss of sense of personal accomplishment. Although never confirmed through valid measures, I feel that throughout my professional career on occasion I have walked along the fringes of burnout. For this reason, and in line with Maslach and Jackson's definition of burnout, I have felt mind overload (1 can't think/act/ do anymore.), distanced myself from my peers and those I serve (I don't even want to be around you and/or your team and nothing you can say or do is going to make me feel better), and at the end of the day driving home feeling as if my biggest accomplishment of the day was placing food order during lunch and finding my way home just in time to eat dinner, go to bed, and do it all over again the next day. This is not how you want to reflect upon your accomplishments at the end of the day for sustained period of time. I would like to share my personal story with you so that you can get sense of how career-driven family-first minded individual has, along with my wife, implemented solutions to balance our family and my career while keeping OUR sanity. In preparation for this article, I sought my wife's perception of our strategy to effectively create stable and attentive environment for our children-three of them between the ages of 6-10, remain happily married, and contribute effectively to our chosen professions. Her answer was simple; she claimed that she did everything and that I did nothing. Really? She finally broke and conceded some cooperative effort on my part (Hint: pick your battles). What we have done after nearly 15 years of marriage was not the result of sitting at home with life coach getting direction on how to manage our lives (not that there is anything wrong with seeking advice); we have created and implemented what we had to do to survive the life/ work balancing act. My wife, although mostly stay-at-home mom, travels out of state on the average of six nights per month for her career in the airline industry, plus an average of 20 hours per week volunteering at our children's school, and finally teaching an arduous fitness class three times week. I, supervisor in law enforcement, work an average of 10 hours per day; five days week, coupled with one hour commute each way. …",

      "title": "Freedom to Choose",
      "abstract": "A person can choose to be positive or negative. Rather than letting the mind control him/her, the person could focus his/her thoughts and attention where he/she wanted them to be. As the fog clears, the person realizes the amount of freedom and self-control he/she can gain. Our life is a reflection of our own beliefs and choices, and often we do not even realize that we are making choices. Sadly, it usually takes tragedies, near-death experiences, getting fired, or other forms of loss to wake us up. Practicing GRIT-generosity, respect, integrity, and truth-will enable us to focus on the right issues, develop ourselves and our teams, and create more with less. We might not have much control over the direction of the marketplace, but we can make a big impact with the way we lead.",

      "abstract": "On GentlenessAnne Dufourmantelle has written that crucial moments of our lives, particularly at the beginning and end, are marked by gentleness: the capacity to attend closely to another.The particular kind of attentiveness that gentleness demands is the terrain of exposure, an exposure given permission, made believable by touch.Evoking gentleness carries real hazards.Being gentle can suggest a cloying anti-conflictual softness, a genteel gentility, a performatively tender underbelly, a bourgeois lack of grit.We want to suggest something else here: that gentleness is an unworking, a commitment and substantive care for the other.Gentleness can move beyond appeasement to a site of agency, resistance and reflection as a mode of living, as a means to traverse anxieties, to not look away, and a vigilance to watch, patiently or not, and demarcate the contours of antagonism.Gentleness displayed at an unexpected, unanticipated moment has the power to overwrite, recode and produce new grammars of exchange.The good life corresponds to the possibility of being together, in a politics that has a horizon beyond the human and a capacity to attend to an entwined exposure.It is not a retreat or an escape or simply a place of symbolic resistance.In and of itself, it has the power to reorder our relations with one another and the more-thanhuman.To act gently is a form of power that is a real force of resistance.Gentleness is often presented as the opposite of brutality and vulgarity, as the sweetness of living, a place to recover time.If we wanted to imagine a borderless world, something beyond the dreams of a state or a nation or an ethnicity, the agility to think around traditional demar-",

      "title": "The Fear of Alienation in Pride and Prejudice",
      "abstract": "AbstractJane Austen's Pride and Prejudice reflects the attitude of the nineteenth century society yet its implications are obvious to the present times as well. The desires, hopes, fears, and social psyche of society are reflected in the socially acceptable or unacceptable principles and practices of society, and the way the members of the society perceive these principles and practices. The confusion between the socially acceptable and individually desirable exists in all societies. Sometimes it comes into conflict with each other in the form of social issues that can be peacefully resolved only through tolerance and understanding. For this, one has to evaluate oneself and learn about the deeper realities of life by interacting with others and developing sympathetic understanding of how the others approach life. Class differences have to be resolved, suffering of the others has to be shared and one must step down from their high pedestal so as to understand the others around them.Keywords. Jane Austin, Pride and Prejudice, fear, alienation,The insipidity, and yet the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all these people!* 1Darcy's interaction with the Bennets, especially Elizabeth, starts the process of self-realization which subsequently leads to broader understanding of life from the point of view of others. The interaction occurs at different levels and subsequently the improvement. Those who achieve an insight become closer to others socially, intellectually, emotionally, and they better prepare themselves for change. For example, Darcy does not change radically. In the words of Elizabeth is very much what he ever (220). But he certainly has leant to accept people as they are and respect them for what they are even though he may not agree with them. He has come to terms with the social norm of his society of not straightaway dismissing people if he does not agree with them. at all he has to show his disapproval, he does that in their absence. This is why later If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight (363).The society we meet in P & P is divided into classes but their boundaries are not clearly defined. In fact they are blurred and seem to merge with each other without distinction. The focus is apparently on the individuals as an integral part of the society to which they belong. Darcy, Lady Catherine, and Bingley are not financial equals. Bingley earns half the amount of Darcy's yearly income and he is not even from the landed gentry but they still share social equality. Mr Bennet, who is from the landed gentry, on the other hand, is unworthy of becoming relative through marriage due to the connections that he has. What exactly makes one worthy and another unworthy of relationship is not very clear here. Mr Benner is from the same class from which Darcy, Bingley, and Lady Catherine are, but he and his family are not good enough on some standards which are difficult to identify.Mr Darcy is the owner of the Pemberley, a kind of model (34) estate. It is envied by the Bingleys because it belongs to an old family of aristocrats. Darcy represents the immaculate primness of the place to which he belongs. The reader is led to understand that comparing Pemberley to Meryton is like comparing noble mien (8, 9), to playful disposition (9). The ideas of self-importance and high social status, with which the new comers enter the lively, noisy, and yet harmonious atmosphere of Hertfordshire, come into clash with the residents; belonging to the higher class they have their own preformed notions of social behaviour. They are highly class-conscious as well as money-conscious. Both parties fail to become friendly with each other because they follow different ethos which do not coincide with each other; hence reserve between them. Bingley turns out to be an exception, because his easy-going personality does not become confused by the complexities that come with consciousness. …",

      "abstract": "Life demands each of us to make tough decisions. Per sons vary in their readiness to make such decisions, yet, ig noring the process does not make critical issues disappear. At home, a person is faced with decisions of how to live most amicably with those close at hand. People also have to make decisions about what happens at work. What needs to be done? With whom? For what ends? Finally, people are faced with decisions relative to one's outreach. How do per sons respond to injustices? to illness? to needs in the immediate community or in other parts of the world? Do people choose to be lulled into euphoria, or do they select to reflect on, even agonize about, situations needing attention? That choice is inherent in life nobody can deny. Most educators are aware that children need opportunities to make decisions. Visit many of today's schools, and what does one see? Fre quently large open spaces with varieties of mater ials displayed, assortments of books from which children can choose what they wish to read, colorful shelves full of games, toys in a play corner, or block corners where children may decide to reenact previous experiences or to cre ate new ones. Such opportunities for decision are frequently seen within the school building. Less frequently seen are school systems in which individual buildings and schools within schools have a clearly stated philosophy and program, such as Montclair, New Jersey, 1 where parents are carefully informed about school possibilities avail able within the community. With their children and the help of school personnel, par ents select the philosophy and program deemed most appro priate for their children. For example, parents can elect to put their children in a gifted and talented magnet school in which giftedness is defined to include all children. Or a sec ondary parent and child may select the School for the Per forming Arts, again the as sumption being that all youth can perform with varying degrees of skill. Choice and decision are acknowledged, and parents engage in tough think ing as they make decisions about their children's education. If one considers selected aspects of school programs, one can find much emphasis on choice. For example, guidance and career educa tion programs frequently help the young deal with certain options that they have. Even though evidences of choice are seen in many school settings, one is frequently hard pressed to find curricula in which attention is given to teaching the delicate and difficult proc esses of making tough decisions. Somehow peo ple tend to feel that choice is enough. Yet, if we",

We suffer injurious intimate relationships because we cannot face the loss of the \"forever delusion\" and the \"perfection delusion\". Our wish for permanence interferes with our ability to mourn crumbling illusions of our romantic love. This continual disappointment can stalk intimate relationships even when both partners have the best of intentions. When defensive strategies are used in relationships to avoid painful emotions, we can get locked in rigid compromise solutions with their attendant frozen feelings. Attachments are very adhesive. We often remain stuck in the clay, unable to stay or leave our hurtful relationship. Grieving our losses can allow us to find the gold of self-differentiation while creating the space to see our partner as his or her own vital person. As illustrative of this theme, we introduce four clinical cases to illustrate the measures people resort to in order to maintain both their relationship stasis and their internal integrity. Those who work to morph the fantasy of the idealized other into a fully dimensional other, while creatively calibrating their contradictory desires of love and hostility, can restore frozen zones from deadness to aliveness, and work through tensions in their relationships.",

Many of the conflicts we find ourselves in, either with friends or within institutions, may need a complex and subtle understanding of sibling dynamics. The famous Controversial Discussions that nearly destroyed the Institute of Psychoanalysis in the early forties could be partly attributed to the unacknowledged and unconscious dynamics of the sibling transferences that swirled around Melanie Klein, Anna Freud and Freud. One of the tasks of therapists is to explore how we all must live within a society, with our contemporaries. This difficulty involves observing that sometimes in therapy we are part of the nursery quarrel itself, rather than superior. And so in adult sibling conflict within an institution, there may be a need for an outside moderator, like a parent, to sort out the quarrel; for when sibling passions are revived at work or in the consulting room, they can knock one sideways with the unmeditated quality of the encounter.",

They are difficult to understand, yet deeply felt. When Faith Is Not Enough is a creative, honest, and original discussion of faith and doubt and the search for human significance. Drawing upon personal experience, literature, psychology, philosophy, and Scripture, philosopher Kelly Clark tackles the difficult question of how we can live with doubt and how we can nurture a faith and develop a self of enduring value. In section one, The Shadow of a Doubt, Clark takes doubt (and doubters) seriously and sets out to help the reader understand faith in a deeper way. He presents a powerful case for the existence of God, offers hope for understanding the problem of God and human suffering, suggests positive ways for dealing with doubt, and affirms the excitement of embracing the adventure of life. Section two, Searching for My Self, is a reflection on the meaning of life. We want our lives to count, but we feel insignificant. We desire fame and honor, but we feel forgotten and ignored. Wishing for significant human relationships, we often feel alienated and unable to communicate. And wanting to live worthy lives, we feel shame. Clark probes into these conflicting emotions and addresses how God can unite the disparate elements of our lives into a meaningful and enduring self.",

The frustrations of undiagnosed (and therefore misunderstood) attention deficit disorder must nearly equal the frustrations of trying to explain the symptoms and sequelae to a world that responds Yes, but ... or Where's the diagnosis? During more than a quarter of a century of professional work, I've helped parents understand their children: the dyslexias, specific language disabilities, learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD. A common saying is that parents must mourn the child they were expecting before they can accept the child who has arrived. Difficult, unwelcome, or disheartening as the task may be initially, parents are obliged to try to understand and to help. It is their job, a command performance. Conversely, James Trilling is a child trying to understand a parent. His bravery and compassion as he reverses the process is a volunteer assignment. That he applies his intellect, his own emotional archaeology, and his humor to understanding the private people who lived inside his parents' public images, and that he then shares with us his insights about them and his honesty about himself, is an act of generosity. The days in which dyslexies were misunderstood, hence bullied, cajoled, humiliated, or shunned, are mercifully past. Not so, yet, for those (of all ages) subject to the bungee jumps of ADD/ADHD. To date, personal histories are our best proof. James Trilling provides a stunner. Priscilla L. Vail",

      "title": "The Comedy of Hegel and the Trauerspiel of Modern Philosophy",
      "abstract": "The general ground for comedy is therefore a world in which man as subject or person has made himself completely master of everything that counts to him otherwise than the essential content of what he wills and accomplishes, a world whose purposes are therefore destroyed because of their unsubstantiality. Nothing can be done, for example, to help a democratic nation where the citizens are self-seeking, quarrelsome, frivolous, bumptious, without faith or knowledge, garrulous, boastful and ineffectual: such a nation destroys itself by its own folly. Hegel is keen to distinguish the merely laughable from the comical in the sequel to this passage from page one thousand, one hundred and ninety-nine of the English translation of his Aesthetics . We may laugh at any contrast between subjective caprice and insubstantial action, while vice and evil are not in themselves comic: “There is also the laughter of derision, scorn, despair, etc. On the other hand, the comical as such implies an infinite light-heartedness and confidence felt by someone raised altogether above his own inner contradiction and not bitter or miserable in it at all; this is the bliss and ease of a man who, being sure of himself, can bear the frustrations of his aims and achievements.” (Is this condition of serenity, I wonder, attained by effort or by grace?) In comedy, “the ruling principle is the contingency and caprice of subjective life” whose nullity and self-destructive folly displays the abused actuality of substantial life. The aberration of the passions that rage in the human heart are drawn from “the aberrations of the democracy out of which the old faith and morals have vanished” (as Hegel describes Aristophanes's comedies). While in tragedy the powers which oppose each other as pathos in individuals are hostile, in comedy, “they are revealed directly as inwardly self-dissolving.” Comedy, as much as tragedy, is always divine comedy , “the Divine here in its community, as the substance and aim of human individuality, brought into existence as something concrete, summoned into action and put in movement.”",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Losing someone u love is very painful. This is particularly true when the death is sudden and unexpected. Grieving is a natural process through which many people experience loss using their own resources. People who lose their loved ones to sudden death seek counseling frequently as they feel stuck in their grief. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to explore the experience of clients who had lost their loved ones to sudden death. Methods: An interpretive hermeneutic phenomenology research approach was chosen for this study. This method allows the researcher to describe a phenomenon as it was experienced and attempts to provide an understanding of the internal meaning of a client’s experience in a lived world. Results: Themes which emerged from the interviews ere the respondents’ feeling of sadness manifested in an urge to cry out. Subsequently, they found sudden death to be an unacceptable fact. Guilt and self-blame embraced them for not being able to prevent the death from happening. The respondents experienced role disruption which resulted in poor job performance and were unable to continue healthy relationships with their loved ones. At the same time, they discovered that they did not really get over the grief but had merely thought backwards and lived forward in order to achieve psychological equilibrium. Lastly, the respondents perceived personal growth when they embraced the concept of frailty of human life and improved their relationship with others. Conclusion: The experience of death, loss and grief triggers an awareness that meaning of life is not something that people can directly search for and obtain. The implication of this study is that psychosocial components play an important role in influencing a client’s health.",

What we need from day to day is not a global rationality, not a rationality all conceivable discussants could recognize, if only they were coherent. Our problem is what to treat as rational among neighbors and other conversants. A person needs to ask what to treat as rational or irrational within the small communities that most engage him. He needs also to ask how to regard the awkward large groups that bear on his life and the lives of those around him. Sometimes cooperation with them is vital. Some times he can enjoy other groups and learn from them. With them he can hope to enjoy a partial community, and so to reap some of the benefits of normative consensus. He cannot, though, hope for any thing like the full community of judgment he can look to with fellow spirits.",

      "abstract": "In a very sharp way of seeing daily reality I have the tendency of putting it like this: “Today, psychiatry is misdirected. Depression is not the main problem and will not be the biggest burden in the immediate future. Depression is a symptom of a bigger social problem. Personality disorder (PD) is the main problem and a reason for depression. On the other hand, psychiatry is powerless in relation with PD. It even has a tendency to bury the problem under the cultural particularity of a nation or of a social group. It seems, the natural development of the human being is becoming a burden, because of the lack of resources that psychiatry (society) has, in dealing (handling) with PD.” In e very peaceful, warm way of seeing daily reality I have the ground of putting it like this: “We are different. Our mind has a large variety in perceiving, understanding and answering to the world around. Some of us tend to decide on a problem, a question that we encounter, in a very sharp, rigid, way. Some tend to oscillate a lot. Many of us use this, two variations, in alternation, based on situation ground: (very) rigid at work, (very) oscillating with close ones or the other way around, as an example. One seems to have trust, power, the other doubt, and weakness.” We can very easily see these two decisions making mechanisms to dominate the psychopathic structure or the neurotic structure. What is very hard to see is the value of them both, the error we make when we understand them, when we give them o social meaning and secondary a social roll, a value. It is not a bad, an illness to be psychopath or neurotic, it is bad, wrong or ill the way we behave with that because we neglect the value of emotions, the need for active dedication in order to develop emotional maturity, consolidated feelings (sentiments) of trust (vertrauen), love (liebe), loyalty (treue) and their successor and consolidator: fulfilment (erfulung).",

      "abstract": "Resilience is defined as a being able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions; capable of withstanding shock or aversive situations without permanent deformation or rupture. For more than 200 years, our country has demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, change, tragedy, and prosperity. The reason for this has been because we, the people of the United States, have taken our citizenship seriously. As such, we have planned, educated, advocated, and implemented the changes we wanted to see in our government and our country, changes that enhanced the quality of life for all citizens. We have elected officials who understood and were accountable to the balance of power created by our constitution, and who were expected to meet ethical standards reflective of principles of democracy far older than our country. As citizens, it is our responsibility to ensure that these values and principles are guiding the design and adoption of laws and policies that benefit all. In times of instability, or change, our worst offense is complacency to an ongoing situation that requires action(s). Complacency is defined as a feeling of quiet pleasure or security, often, while unaware of some potential danger, defect, or the like. Our field of early childhood intervention (ECI) is currently experiencing such instability, as is the field of disability and health care services for our most vulnerable population. As professionals in ECI, we must demonstrate resilience and fight against the complacency that will allow legal and policy decisions to erode programs and services that have supported infants and young children with disabilities and their families; programs and services that were built to enhance children's development and improve their families' quality of life. These include the Affordable Care Act, which allowed for health insurance coverage for all regardless of preexisting conditions, and the Medicaid program. Although Medicaid has been seen by many in our country as insurance for the poor, it is much more: It is the core funding mechanism for community-based health and long-term services to children and adults with disabilities, regardless of income level. In fact, both Parts C and B of the Individual with Disabilities Education Act utilize Medicaid funds to support the delivery of early intervention (EI) and school-based therapy services for eligible children. Part C, in particular, will be eroded in many states with the proposed reorganization of the Medicaid program. Medicaid has also supported medical care at home for children who have complex needs, regardless of income level; allowing them to remain at home with their family, as opposed to living in a hospital. These programs must not be weakened. If so, there will be many families and children who will experience negative effects on their lives. Our country will have many long-term social and economic consequences. Our field is resilient, and it will continue to be, as long as we in the field do not become complacent to the negative changes being proposed that will affect those we serve. CURRENT ISSUE Our first article focused on the role of families in their children's learning. Brook Sawyer and Philippa Campbell studied the teaching behaviors of EI providers who provided home visits to families. A sample of 265 home visits was videotaped and then rated using the Natural Environments Rating Scale–Revised. Findings suggested that incidental learning opportunities were frequently available for the child during the home visits, but the providers generally did not use these opportunities to teach parents. Differences in teaching behavior of the providers were associated with caregiver engagement, caregiver education, child disability type, and provider discipline. Recommendations for teaching parents and their children during home visits are provided. Our second article by Patricia Blasco, Sybille Guy, Sage Saxton, and Susanne Duvall presented longitudinal data on 279 children born at high risk for developmental delay because of low birth weight (LBW). These children were followed as they aged, and information was collected on both their developmental capability and their EI enrollment. Findings suggested children born LBW receiving EI services had lower overall developmental standard scores than those not in EI. Another finding was that an equal number of children across all categories of birth weight were not receiving any EI services. Implications for the identification and enrollment of the children in EI are provided by the authors. Harriet Able, Tracey A. West, and Chih Ing Lim used focus group methodology to identify EI practitioners' ethical concerns in daily practice. Eighty-two ECI professionals shared experiences in reaction to an EI case study that described conflicting parental and professional views about a child's services. The participants were then asked to describe their experiences with service delivery, policy implementation, ethical challenges, and the resolution strategies they used. The authors provide guidelines for ethical reflection and problem-solving strategies based on Codes of Ethics from professional organizations. Li Luo, Patricia Snyder, Cinda L. Clark, and Xiumin Hong examined the use of teaching practices in China. Twenty preschool classrooms on Mainland China were observed using the prepublication version of the Teaching Pyramid Observation Tool for Preschool Classrooms (TPOT-P; Fox, Hemmeter, & Snyder, 2008). Teachers also completed the social-emotional teaching practices survey. The observations documented that the majority of teachers did not use key teaching practices associated with the Pyramid Model, nor did they develop individualized behavior plans for children with the most severe challenging behaviors. There was also no correlation between the observed implementation of the Pyramid Model and the teacher's self-report of their use of these. Implications of these results and considerations for future research are provided. Our last article is an international submission from South Africa about the perception of caregivers about collaborations within their child's ECI program. Thilendree Kyarkanaye, Shakila Dada, and Alecia Samuels asked 64 caregivers to complete a questionnaire in their primary language about collaborations within the ECI teams in their child's program. The results suggested that caregivers understood the concept of collaboration in their intervention teams, yet collaboration was undervalued when compared with family-centered practices. Recommendations for improvement of caregiver's understanding of collaboration are outlined by the authors. As always, I would like to thank the authors for their contributions and those Editorial Board members who provided the comprehensive reviews that resulted in the articles in this issue. I am also pleased that we have articles representing other countries, new authors, and members of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities. —Mary Beth Bruder, PhD Editor",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

      "title": "Riding the Emotional Roller Coaster of Retirement While Caring for a Loved One",
      "abstract": "I look to the future because that's where I'm going to spend the rest of my life.-George Burns Retirement is difficult. Caregiving is difficult. Together they can seem impossible. Yet it is a situation many people have to face every day. A Scenario Here is the scenario: You are approaching retirement from your present full-time job and you are dreaming about your plans for the future. You have been anxiously waiting for the day that you will begin traveling to faraway places for more than one or two weeks, or you have been thinking about returning to school to earn another degree, or you are planning to take a certificate program in floral arrangement in preparation for your trip to Japan to study Ikebana. You may be thinking of selling your condo or home or giving up your apartment and moving to another city where the weather is warmer and living seems easier. Or you may need to keep working financially and are considering new full- or part-time employment, possibly in a different career. You see almost limitless opportunities before you. But life does not always go according to plan. Someone close to you can no longer take care of him or herself, and in a flash everything changes-your dreams and future are put on hold. You have suddenly been thrust into the role of caregiver and your world has just turned upside down. You are being pulled into a whirlwind by two powerful forces, retirement transition and caregiving. You are not only in charge of your life but now you are also responsible for someone else's, and you must keep standing strong to weather the storm. This is a difficult situation faced by many adults approaching retirement or already in retirement. Understanding the demands required in caregiving and taking care of your retirement needs at the same time can be complicated and stressful but certainly not impossible. On the next pages I will discuss the role these two forces play in your life and future and will offer strategies to help you take care of yourself when you feel you are losing control. The Emotional Roller Coaster of Retirement First let us look at what I refer to in my book, Achieving the Good Life After 50, as the emotional roller coaster of retirement. Depending on circumstances, your reaction to retirement will vary. If you have made plans you will be busy and feel content. Without plans you may either become euphoric at first-only to feel let down and depressed afterward-or become let down and depressed immediately. Even with plans, adjustment to retirement can take from several months to several years. In 2003 I presented a study at The International Career Development Conference in Sacramento, California, based on my work with teachers in retirement. In this study I described the predominant emotional and psychological issues around retirement. Clients presented simultaneously conflicting issues: feelings of loss and freedom and feelings of excitement and fear. Many had dreamed of the day they would retire. Yet when faced with the reality, fear set in, leading to inertia and an inability to make decisions and move forward with their lives. They wanted meaning and fulfillment in their lives but were not sure how to achieve it. I became personally familiar with the topic of retirement change and transition when I retired from my career of twenty-five years. My retirement path had many bumps and turns, not unlike those of the clients I had counseled. It took me almost two years to move through my retirement transition process, to adjust to a new role and a new identity. It was not easy. I needed to work through William Bridges's three-stage transition process-endings, the neutral zone, new beginnings-as described in his book, Transitions. In my work I discovered many people view retirement as: * A time to literally and figuratively clean house: I will sort through the pile of articles I've been collecting and finally get to read them. …",

      "title": "Tua o te Aria. Doorways into Dying",
      "abstract": "As we age or become terminally ill, we are confronted by our mortality. Being confronted by our own or another’s death can be a time of accelerated and profound growth and development. Using examples from research and personal experience working in a hospice, this article explores challenges facing our own dying as well as that of clients and family members. It discusses the relevance and benefits of psychotherapy at end of life. Throughout the dying process, disturbances can occur that may be dismissed or pathologized. This article goes further and suggests that the dying person’s apparent confusion, complex language, agitation or unusual movements, dreams and visions are some of the ways they communicate their needs and let us know what is happening to them. These phenomena are doorways through which we can connect and assist the dying to find meaning in what is happening. The dying may also experience altered and extreme states of consciousness such as coma. It is believed that in these deep inner states they are continuing their development and making spiritual connections. Rather than leaving them alone to fend for themselves, innovative interventions such as joining the world of the patient and pacing their breath are suggested. The work described in this article is based on the methods and skills found in Process Oriented Psychology, and its application to palliative care.

      "abstract": "A talk given to the Dominican Sisters at Rosary Priory, Bushey, England, on 12 March 1983 . Let’s begin with the case against obedience, I mean the case against obedience in general. There is a very widely held view that obedience is a necessary evil. I think more of the sisters and brethren subscribe to this view than would admit to it, even to themselves. The view is not confined to people at the receiving end, those who have to do the obeying; it is shared by quite a lot of people who do the commanding. I don’t want to make this a matter of obedience’. To put someone under obedience is thought of as a sort of last resort. We ought to be able to get along without obedience but, the world being what it is, and interests conflicting as they do, we just have to use it from time to time, like war or surgical operations. The root of this opinion is a certain view of what it is to be a human being. The view that we are each unique individual subjects with our own personalities and desires and talents and that the good life consists in each one of us developing her/his individual personality as far as possible. As far as possible; because the full and complete development of the personality of Sister Ermyntrude may turn out to be incompatible with the full and complete development of the personality of Sister Gladiola: they therefore have to find some kind of compromise, a little give and take on each side.",

      "title": "Grief, bereavement, and traumatic stress as natural results of reproductive losses.",
      "abstract": "Grief is a universal human experience. Life is a series of gains and losses, attachments and detachments. Some are healthy and gradual while others are unhealthy and abrupt. Sudden losses, unexpected traumas, and intrusive tragedies are most difficult to handle and process. They can be disorienting, destabilizing, and devastating to the whole person, family, organization, or community.Experiencing loss, grief, and trauma is always difficult, tender, and painful. People normally avoid difficult emotions and unpleasant memories. Major losses and traumatic events come in different shapes, forms, degrees, and intensities. They generate a wide range of reactions and responses on the mental, emotional, behavioral, social, and existential levels. They also affect our mood, function, and mental outlook and impact our relationships and roles within the family, community, or society (Abi-Hashem, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c, 2012; Attig, 2010; Figley, 2012; Gordon, 2013; Lindemann, 1944; Osterweis, Solomon, & Green, 1984; Pearlman, et al., 2014; Rando, 1988; Worden, 2009.Definition of TermsDefining the concepts, themes, connotations, and terminologies before discussing them is always important for any meaningful discussion and comprehensive understanding. Because some terms are similar, yet not identical, they are used interchangeably in the literature (cf. Abi-Hashem, 1999a, 2012, in press; Conway, & Valentine, 1988; Figley, 2012; Murray, 2016; Rando, 1988; Smelser, 2004; Strength, 1999; Wolfelt, 2003; Worden, 2009):Grief is a deep sorrow, an aching of the soul and a torment of the mind. It is an overwhelming sense of loss, which normally results in anguish and emotional suffering. Grief feels like a stranger and an intruder as it engulfs the personality like waves. It can actually be described as a process and an outcome at the same time.Loss is a sense of deprivation or painful separation from the beloved - a person, object, function, place, or idea. It can be minor or major, sudden or gradual, tangible or symbolic, single or multiple, real or perceived, expected or unexpected, ambiguous or anticipatory, private or public, local or communal.Bereavement is the state of having suffered a loss. It is being in a sad condition and a sober realization that something essential is missing, which at times shatters the world of the survivor(s).Mourning is the outer expression of the internal experience of grief. It is the public show of affection or behavior that releases the agony of the heart and of the mind. It is socially and culturally formed as each society has its own ways and rituals for expressing sorrow and deep sadness.Trauma is an unusual troubling event, which generates substantial anxiety, acute stress responses, sense of horror, and overwhelming helplessness. It can be mild, moderate, or severe in nature. It can be experienced in a single or multiple episodes. Like the other key terms, trauma is experiential on the conscious and unconscious level and is conceptualized by both the subjective and objective criteria of the people and communities involved.Reproductive Losses are referred to as any absence of innate function, missing of a promised child, or a tangible loss surrounding the natural human cycle of propagation. That includes fertility, conception, pregnancy, delivery, or birth. That is true time-wise (chronologically), meaning before, during, or after the infant is conceived and born as well as months after the actual birth. Such losses can be voluntarily or involuntarily. They cover a wide range of reproductive activities and misfortunes, like inability to conceive, miscarriage, failure of fertility aids and devices, stillbirth, perinatal-neonatal failure, birth abnormalities, sudden infant death, physical disability, etc. They also include maternal death (mother dying during or shortly after giving birth) and any interruption and dysfunction of the normal-natural process of the human reproduction system. …",

      "title": "Trust in Education",
      "abstract": "There is a growing awareness of the crucial role that trust plays in every aspect of a school’s functioning and especially to student outcomes. To trust another person or group is to be at ease, without anxiety or worry, in a situation of interdependence in which valued outcomes depend upon the participation and contribution of others. The trustor can rest assured that their expectations will be fulfilled based on confidence in the other party’s benevolence, honesty, openness, reliability, and competence. As citizens across the globe have become increasingly distrustful of their institutions and leaders, the trend away from trust creates a special challenge for schools because trust is so fundamental to their core mission of educating students. The philosopher Annette Baier observed that we tend to notice trust as we notice air, only when it becomes scarce or polluted. These days, it seems evident that trust in our society as a whole has indeed been disrupted and is in scarce supply. As contemporary society has grown more complex, as changing economic realities, changing demographics, and changing expectations in society have made life less predictable, we are beginning to <italic>notice</italic> trust much more. There are a number of things that make cultivating and maintaining trust in schools challenging. These include the effects of social media, and other new forms of information and the propensity for the news of potential threats to one’s well-being, as well as the well-being of one’s children and community to spread farther and faster than positive news. Trust matters in schools and in our world because we cannot single-handedly either create or sustain many of the things we most cherish. Parents send their children to schools, trusting that they will be safe from harm, as well as guided and taught in keeping with our highest hopes for them. Schools are also invested with a significant share of a community’s collective resources in the form of tax dollars, school buildings, and local employment opportunities. In addition, schools are charged with keeping and promoting a society’s shared values and ideals. They foster and protect the collective ideals of respect, tolerance, and democracy, as well as the vision of equity of opportunity. Indeed, the future of a society rests with the quality of its schools. It is evident, then, why trust has become such a pressing issue for schools in these challenging and turbulent times.",

      "abstract": "Awoken to life from the night of unconsciousness, the will finds itself as an individual in a world without end or limit, among countless individuals who are all striving, suffering, going astray; and it hurries back to the old unconsciousness, as if through a bad dream. – But until then its desires are unlimited, its claims inexhaustible, and every satisfied desire gives birth to a new one. No possible worldly satisfaction could be enough to quiet its longing, give its desires a final goal, and fill the bottomless pit of its heart. Moreover, we can see what usually becomes of a human being with any sort of satisfaction: it is for the most part nothing more than the meagre daily preservation of this existence itself, amid endless trouble and constant care, in the struggle with need and with death in view. – Everything in life proclaims that earthly happiness is ordained to be in vain or recognized as an illusion. The basis for this lies deep in the essence of things. Accordingly, life for most human beings turns out to be miserable and short. For the most part, the comparatively happy only appear so, or else, like the longlived, they are rare exceptions for whomthe possibility had to remain open – as a decoy. Life presents itself as an ongoing deception, in matters both small and large. What is promised is not delivered, unless it is to show how undesirable the thing desired was: and so we are deceived now by the hope and now by what we had hoped for.What is given is given only so that it can be taken away. The magic of distance shows us paradises that vanish like optical illusions after we have allowed ourselves to be taken in. And so happiness always lies in the future, or in the past, and the present is like a 658 small dark cloud driven by the wind over the sunlit plains: both in front of it and behind it everything is bright, it alone casts a constant shadow. The present is therefore always unsatisfying, but the future is uncertain, and the past cannot be recovered.",

If so, this is the book for you! Social work is a stimulating and exciting career - but it can also be frustrating and exhausting. It's easy to get so caught up in the challenges of work that it becomes difficult to see the wood from the trees. If only you were able to step back. The Assertive Social Worker will provide you with the tools to do just that and, as a result, will empower you to do your job better. By treating assertiveness as a set of skills which can be learned, practised and refined, the author opens the door to a way of thinking and behaving which can turn your whole life around. Although assertiveness may not traditionally have been associated with social work or the broader range of caring professions, it is based upon respect for yourself and others - a clear parallel with the underlying principles of your chosen career.",

Initially, the client is likely to feel at a disadvantage at the strangeness of the situation. The interpreter's contact with the client through their common language can feel enviably direct to the therapist. The therapist needs to avoid acting from his own need to feel secure and confident, rather than from the crosscurrents of positive and negative feeling in the room, which are likely to carry anxiety. The therapist will often feel greatly inadequate, being separated from the client by language, culture, and life experience. More personal expression of thoughts and feelings is preserved in the language of homeland. Negative or ambivalent feelings about the new language are unlikely to be spoken about in the consulting room unless by the therapist, but need to be appreciated.",

      "abstract": "Darwin, James, and Freud were among the first scientists who started addressing the question of emotions, i.e. the understanding of emotions. Every culture understands emotions differently, but on the whole we could say that emotions are a term used for people's reactions to a certain event. Hence, we can react positively or negatively to a given situation. We can count happiness, love, pleasure, and hope as positive emotions, while jealousy, hatred, disgust, sadness, and sorrow can be considered negative. According to Oatley and Jenkins (1996), an emotion is usually brought about by an either conscious or subconscious evaluation of an event as important in the process of attaining a valuable goal: an emotion is perceived as positive when the goal is attained and as negative when the realization of the goal is hindered. Grieving in children refers to aspects in their lives when they lose something they deeply care about. This may refer to a loss of a loved one, their favourite toy, moving house, their parents' divorce, etc. It is of the highest importance that the child receive support and understanding in these moments from their family members and the people they feel close to. Everyone is sad in their own way. Therefore, the process of grieving will progress more smoothly when the child's needs are met and accepted, and when the children are helped with facing the unpleasant event.",

      "title": "Introduction: The Tyrant's Fear",
      "abstract": "Introduction:The Tyrant's Fear Silvia Bigliazzi, Guest Editor (bio) Then it is the truth, though some may deny it, that the real tyrant is really enslaved to cringings and servitudes beyond compare, a flatterer of the basest men, and that, so far from finding even the least satisfaction for his desires, he is in need of most things, and is a poor man in very truth, as is apparent if one knows how to observe a soul in its entirety; and throughout his life he teems with terrors and is full of convulsions and pains, if in fact he resembles the condition of the city which he rules; and he is like it, is he not? Plato, Republic 9.579d–e1 These are both the measures mentioned some time back to secure the safety of a tyranny as far as possible—the lopping off of outstanding men and the destruction of the proud,—and also the prohibition of common meals and club-fellowship and education and all other things of this nature, in fact the close watch upon all things that usually engender the two emotions of pride and confidence, and the prevention of the formation of study-circles and other conferences for debate, and the employment of every means that will make people as much as possible unknown to one another (for familiarity increases mutual confidence). Aristotle, Politics 5.11 1313a40–b62 [End Page 1] Tyranny and Fear Fear is the coessential ingredient of tragedy, and tragedy, since Aristotle, deals with the stories of those who are above us—heroes, kings, and tyrants. Fear, together with pity, is what we, as spectators, are to experience in order to achieve the catharsis of such emotions.3 Thus, the tragic experience is first and foremost an experience of fear at different levels: onstage, where the action displays the people's fear of the tyrant and the tyrant's own fear of them, and in the interplay between stage and audience, where we all identify with those who fear the tyrant but also with the tyrant who in turn fears them. Famously, Plato and Aristotle underlined in varying degrees the fear felt by the tyrant, pointing to the psychological drives of his behavior. For Plato, he is a slave to both desire and fear since these coalesce into one and the same knot of passions. Incapable of self-control, the tyrant desires and fears all. Aristotle does not linger so much on the tyrant's inward dynamics as on his actions consequent to his fear of losing power, assuming contrasting passions as the springboard for political action. The tyrant prunes the state of those who oppose him or only represent a potential threat or an alternative to his power, preventing debate, the circulation of ideas, and possibilities of consorting. The tyrant is a solitary man. Notably, Xenophon underlined Hiero's solitude in the homonymous dialogue, where he, the tyrant of Syracuse, explains to the poet Simonides his painful condition of loneliness and fear of unsafety. No one is free anymore in a state where the tyrant may trust neither his own guards nor the citizens, and must enlist the barbarians to defend him.4 Seneca would remark that \"errat enim si quis existimat tutum esse ibi regem ubi nihil a rege tutum sit; securitas securitate mutua paciscenda est.\" (If anyone thinks that the king is safe in a situation where nothing is safe from the king, they are wrong. Security is purchased by reciprocal security.)5 Where the political handling of power within the state is based upon the tyrant's fear and that of the people, it means that the state is founded on a regime of Terror.6 These ancient positions make clear that the origin of the perpetuation of fear in the state, spreading terror among the people, resides in the tyrant's own fear, suggesting a curious reciprocity between subject and object: the more the tyrant fears, the more he makes himself feared by his [End Page 2] subjects. Seneca added to the picture the psychological torments of bad conscience, turning the fearful tyrant into the opposite of the stoically serene sage.7 In De...",

How should we who live in this common world conceive of ourselves and how should we act? Making the distinction between us and them is crucial to determining our duties, our rights, and our responsibilities. It would be wise to begin by recognizing that these are difficult questions and do not depend on assumed evidence, as if there were no distinction between us and ourselves. A preconception of this type is hidden in no small number of the ways in which we understand collective identity, in the elitism of the experts, in certain self-protective reflexes, in solidarities that conceal exclusions, but also in some of the animosity that emerges against representation and intermediation under the flag of direct democracy or economic self-regulation. These are examples of some ways of thinking and acting that assume the answer to the question about who we are.",

However, in the age of the internet, that impossibility becomes relatively easy to overcome. First, it is necessary to understand what drives youngsters to partake in scary activities. Jih-Hsuan et al. suggest that this desire, especially for horror video games, comes from a feeling of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is defined as an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments (Carey and Forsyth). Essentially, people enjoy being scared because they enjoy satisfying the belief that they would perform well in the same situation they see in front of them. So many bad horror movies are watched over and over because the viewers satisfy their self-efficacy by making fun of the characters' decisions or inserting themselves in the situation and surviving.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important features of a treadmill is that we get to push the buttons. We choose to go faster or slower. We raise or lower the incline. We determine how much we are able to accomplish at any given time. Imagine that you have a treadmill in the hallway outside your room at school. Every time anyone walks down the hall, he or she can push any button on your treadmill. At any moment, you may be forced to walk or run, go up an incline or down. You may be forced to stop abruptly or run to the point of exhaustion. You may have a painful injury or medical condition unknown to oth­ers, but that does not influence the rigorous choices others make for you. This imaginary scenario is, of course, a metaphor for how we can be pulled out of ourselves and how we can allow others to mismanage us. Those who push our buttons do so with our tacit permission. At some level, we allow it. Being savvy about the metaphoric treadmills in schools means that we are sensitive to our own needs and knowledge­able about our own capacities. We can stay us. We can reclaim the best of us. We must divest ourselves from others who, intentionally or unintentionally, take control over us. Simply removing ourselves from the situation is sometimes best. Speaking up can clarify needs. Staying silent can allow us to resolve the matter without letting others know our struggle. Decide whether speaking up or choosing a silent solution is better for you. Stay you. Any time you can demonstrate your willingness to listen to someone with a minimum of self- defensiveness or criti­cism, you are cultivating virtues within yourself that have a high payoff in self- respect. Any significant personal change requires exactly this kind of courage: the willingness to feel uncomfortable while acting “as if” one is more mature and capable than one’s familiar self.

He knows that there are serious and life-threatening illnesses that are difficult or even impossible to live with. From popular science or health education books and articles he has learned a rudimentary knowledge of the presence and prevalence of serious diseases that plague the civilized world. However, the fullness of life, the daily troubles and joys have their effect in the sense that one, except for personal professional interests, does not think more deeply about the world of the sick. One can only wish that one's journey through life will not be overshadowed by illness and that life, uncomplicated by illness, will pass according to expectation, ending many years later in physiological old age.",

      "abstract": "The very act of walking through hospital doors takes many people away from their comfort zone of predictability, into a vulnerable state of uncertainty. When entering a building, most people immediately recognize a space that inspires confidence and trust. Whether one is on the giving or receiving end of health care, the inherent risk around personal health can provoke loaded, challenging, stressful thoughts. A positive impression makes a difference. There are few places where art has capacity to impact people more than in a health care facility. People must process deeper and more significant thoughts when faced with medical interventions. By designing a welcoming environment filled with art that is both contemplative and inspirational, an “enlightened” health care space can support and relieve emotional stressors.#646 (Indian Summer)When a person has the opportunity to look at and connect with art, a private internal exploration occurs. Perhaps an unnamed fear or unvoiced question surfaces in the exchange. Perhaps a memory is awakened or a love remembered that brings healing to the moment. This exchange can be powerful and meaningful in a nonlinear, nonverbal way. Art can shift one’s health care experience to a more positive sense of well-being and can support greater healing. Many health care facilities are including art as a part of the healing solution, and I have been fortunate to display my own artwork in the health care setting. The piece featured on this month’s cover is from the series Indian Summer. Vermont often enjoys a “grace” period between summer and fall that celebrates the flowers just showing their seed petticoats, the light changing to a cooler shade, the rich greens starting to dry and hint at a rustling in the breezes. The inevitable rhythms of nature provide so much material to ponder and work with in the human experience.",

      "title": "“your darkness also/rich and beyond fear”: Community Performance, Somatic Poetics and the Vessels of Self and Other",
      "abstract": "“Communicating deep feeling in linear solid blocks of print felt arcane, a method beyond me” — Audre Lorde in an interview with Adrienne Rich (Lorde 87) How do you disclose? In writing, in spoken words, in movements, in sounds, in the quiet energetic vibration and its trace in discourse? Is disclosure a narrative account of a self, or a poetic fragment, sent into the world outside the sanction of a story or another recognisable form (see fig. 1)?These are the questions that guide my exploration in this essay. I meditate on them from the vantage point of my own self-narrative, as a community performance practitioner and writer, a poet whose artistry, in many ways, relies on the willingness of others to disclose, to open themselves, and yet who feels ambivalent about narrative disclosures. What I share with you, reader, are my thoughts on what some may call compassion fatigue, on boredom, on burn-out, on the inability to be moved by someone’s hard-won right to story her life, to tell his narrative, to disclose her pain. I find it ironic that for as long as I can remember, my attention has often wandered when someone tells me their story—how this cancer was diagnosed, what the doctors did, how she coped, how she garnered support, how she survived, how that person died, how she lived. The story of how addiction took over her life, how she craved, how she hated, how someone sponsored her, listened to her, how she is making amends, how she copes, how she gets on with her life. The story of being born this way, being prodded this way, being paraded in front of doctors just like this, being operated on, being photographed, being inappropriately touched, being neglected, being forgotten, being unloved, being lonely. Listening to these accounts, my attention does wander, even though this is the heart blood of my chosen life—these are the people whose company I seek, with whom I feel comfortable, with whom I make art, with whom I make a life, to whom I disclose my own stories. But somehow, when we rehearse these stories in each others’s company (for rehearsal, polishing, is how I think of storytelling), I drift. In this performance-as-research essay about disclosure, I want to draw attention to what does draw my attention in community art situations, what halts my drift, and allows me to find connection beyond a story that is unique and so special to this individual, but which I feel I have heard so many times. What grabs me, again and again, lies beyond the words, beyond the “I did this… and that… and they did this… and that,” beyond the story of hardship and injury, recovery and overcoming. My moment of connection tends to happen in the warmth of this hand in mine. It occurs in the material connection that seems to well up between these gray eyes and my own deep gaze. I can feel the skin change its electric tonus as I am listening to the uncoiling account. There’s a timbre in the voice that I follow, even as I lose the words. In the moment of verbal disclosure, physical intimacy changes the time and space of encounter. And I know that the people I sit with are well aware of this—it is not lost on them that my attention isn’t wholly focused on the story they are telling, that I will have forgotten core details when next we work together. But they are also aware, I believe, of those moments of energetic connect that happen through, beyond and underneath the narrative disclosure. There is a physical opening occurring here, right now, when I tell this account to you, when you sit by my side and I confess that I can’t always keep the stories of my current community participants straight, that I forget names all the time, that I do not really wish to put together a show with lots of testimony, that I’d rather have single power words floating in space.Figure 1. Image: Keira Heu-Jwyn Chang. Performer: Neil Marcus.”water burns sun”. Burning. 2009. Orientation towards the Frame: A Poetics of VibrationThis essay speaks about how I witness the uncapturable in performance, how the limits of sharing fuel my performance practice. I also look at the artistic processes of community performance projects, and point out traces of this other attention, this poetics of vibration. One of the frames through which I construct this essay is a focus on the formal in practice: on an attention to the shapes of narratives, and on the ways that formal experimentation can open up spaces beyond and beneath the narratives that can sound so familiar. An attention to the formal in community practice is often confused with an elitist drive towards quality, towards a modern or post-modern play with forms that stands somehow in opposition to how “ordinary people” construct their lives. But there are other ways to think about “the formal,” ways to question the naturalness with which stories are told, poems are written, the ease of an “I”, the separation between self and those others (who hurt, or love, or persecute, or free), the embedment of the experience of thought in institutions of thinking. Elizabeth St. Pierre frames her own struggle with burn-out, falling silent, and the need to just keep going even if the ethical issues involved in continuing her research overwhelm her. She charts out her thinking in reference to Michel Foucault’s comments on how to transgress into a realm of knowing that stretches a self, allows it “get free of oneself.”Getting free of oneself involves an attempt to understand the ‘structures of intelligibility’ (Britzman, 1995, p. 156) that limit thought. Foucault (1984/1985) explaining the urgency of such labor, says, ‘There are times in life when the question of knowing if one can think differently than one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting at all’ (p. 8). (St. Pierre 204)Can we think outside the structure of story, outside the habits of thought that make us sense and position ourselves in time and space, in power and knowledge? Is there a way to change the frame, into a different format, to “change our mind”? And even if there is not, if the structures of legibility always contain what we can think, there might be riches in that borderland, the bordercountry towards the intelligible, the places where difference presses close in an uncontained, unstoried way. To think differently, to get free of oneself: all these concerns resonate deeply with me, and with the ways that I wish to engage in community art practice. Like St. Pierre, I try to embrace Deleuzian, post-structuralist approaches to story and self:The collective assemblage is always like the murmur from which I take my proper name, the constellation of voices, concordant or not, from which I draw my voice. […] To write is perhaps to bring this assemblage of the unconscious to the light of day, to select the whispering voices, to gather the tribes and secret idioms from which I extract something I call myself (moi). I is an order word. (Deleuze and Guattari 84).“I” wish to perform and to write at the moment when the chorus of the voices that make up my “I” press against my skin, from the inside and the outside, query the notion of ‘skin’ as barrier. But can “I” stay in that vibrational moment? This essay will not be an exercise in quotation marks, but it is an essay of many I’s, and—imagine you see this essay performed—I invite the vibration of the hand gestures that mark small breaches in the air next to my head as I speak.Like St. Pierre, I get thrown off those particular theory horses again and again. But curiosity drives me on, and it is a curiosity nourished not by the absence of (language) connection, by isolation, but by the fullness of those movements of touch and density I described above. That materiality of the tearful eye gaze, the electricity of those fine skin hairs, the voice shivering me: these are not essentialist connections that somehow reveal or disclose a person to me, but these matters make the boundaries of “me” and “person” vibrate. Disclose here becomes the density of living itself, the flowing, non-essential process of shaping lives together. Deleuze and Guattari (1987) have called this bordering “deterritorialization,” always already bound to the reterritorialisation that allows the naming of the experience. Breath-touch on the limits of territories.This is not a shift from verbal to a privileging of non-verbal communication, finding richness and truth in one and less in the other. Non-verbal communication can be just as conventional as spoken language. When someone’s hand reaches out to touch someone who is upset, that gesture can feel ingrained and predictable, and the chain of caretaking that is initiated by the gesture can even hinder the flow of disclosure the crying or upset person might be engaged in. Likewise, I believe the common form of the circle, one I use in nearly every community session I lead, does not really create more community than another format would engender. The repetition of the circle just has something very comforting, it can allow all participants to drop into a certain kind of ease that is different from the everyday, but the rules of that ease are not open—circles territorialise as much as they de-territorialise: here is an inside, here an outside. There is nothing inherently radical in them. But circles might create a radical shift in communication situations when they break open other encrusted forms—an orientation to a leader, a group versus individual arrangement, or the singularity of islands out in space. Circles brings lots of multiples into contact, they “gather the tribes.” What provisional I’s we extract from them in each instance is our ethical challenge.Bodily Fantasies on the Limit: BurningEven deeply felt inner experiences do not escape the generic, and there is lift available in the vibration between the shared fantasy and the personal fantasy. I lead an artists’ collective, The Olimpias, and in 2008/2009, we created Burning, a workshop and performance series that investigated cell imagery, cancer imagery, environmental sensitivity and healing journeys through ritual-based happenings infused with poetry, dramatic scenes, Butoh and Contact Improvisation dances, and live drawing (see: http://www.olimpias.org/).Performance sites included the Subterranean Arthouse, Berkeley, July and October 2009, the Earth Matters on Stage Festival, Eugene, Oregon, May 2009, and Fort Worden, Port Townsend, Washington State, August 2009. Participants for each installation varied, but always included a good percentage of disabled artists.(see fig. 2).Figure 2. Image: Linda Townsend. Performers: Participants in the Burning project. “Burning Action on the Beach”. Burning. 2009. In the last part of these evening-long performance happenings, we use meditation techniques to shift the space and time of participants. We invite people to lie down or otherwise become comfortable (or to observe in quiet). I then begin to lead the part of the evening that most closely dovetails with my personal research exploration. With a slow and reaching voice, I ask people to breathe, to become aware of the movement of breath through their bodies, and of the hollows filled by the luxuriating breath. Once participants are deeply relaxed, I take them on journeys which activate bodily fantasies. I ask them to breathe in colored lights (and leave the specific nature of the colors to them). I invite participants to become cell bodies—heart cells, liver cells, skin cells—and to explore the properties and sensations of these cell environments, through both internal and external movement. “What is the surface, what is deep inside, what does the granular space of the cell feel like? How does the cell membrane move?” When deeply involved in these explorations, I move through the room and give people individual encounters by whispering to them, one by one—letting them respond bodily to the idea that their cell encounters alchemical elements like gold and silver, lead or mercury, or other deeply culturally laden substances like oil or blood. When I am finished with my individual instruction to each participant, all around me, people are moving gently, undulating, contracting and expanding, their eyes closed and their face full of concentration and openness. Some have dropped out of the meditation and are sitting quietly against a wall, observing what is going on around them. Some move more than others, some whisper quietly to themselves.When people are back in spoken-language-time, in sitting-upright-time, we all talk about the experiences, and about the cultural body knowledges, half-forgotten healing practices, that seem to emerge like Jungian archetypes in these movement journeys. During the meditative/slow movement sequence, some long-standing Olimpias performers in the room had imagined themselves as cancer cells, and gently moved with the physical imagery this brought to them. In my meditation invitations during the participatory performance, I do not invite community participants to move as cancer cells—it seems to me to require a more careful approach, a longer developmental period, to enter this darkly signified state, even though Olimpias performers do by no means all move tragically, darkly, or despairing when entering “cancer movement.” In workshops in the weeks leading up to the participatory performances, Olimpias collaborators entered these experiences of cell movement, different organ parts, and cancerous movement many times, and had time to debrief and reflect on their experiences.After the immersion exercise of cell movement, we ask people how it felt like to lie and move in a space that also held cancer cells, and if they noticed different movement patterns, different imaginaries of cell movement, around them, and how that felt. This leads to rich discussions, testimonies of poetic embodiment, snippets of disclosures, glimpses of personal stories, but the echo of embodiment seems to keep the full, long stories at bay, and outside of the immediacy of our sharing. As I look around myself while listening, I see some hands intertwined, some gentle touches, as people rock in the memory of their meditations.nowyour light shines very brightlybut I want youto knowyour darkness alsorichand beyond fear (Lorde 87)My research aim with these movement meditation sequences is not to find essential truths about human bodily imagination, but to explore the limits of somatic experience and cultural expression, to make artful life experiential and to hence create new tools for living in the chemically saturated world we all inhabit.I need to add here that these are my personal aims for Burning—all associated artists have their own journey, their own reasons for being involved, and there is no necessary consensus—just a shared interest in transformation, the cultural images of disease, disability and addiction, the effects of invasion and touch in our lives, and how embodied poetry can help us live. (see fig. 3). For example, a number of collaborators worked together in the participatory Burning performances at the Subterranean Arthouse, a small Butoh performance space in Berkeley, located in an old shop, complete with an open membrane into the urban space—a shop-window and glass door. Lots of things happen with and through us during these evenings, not just my movement meditations.One of my colleagues, Sadie Wilcox, sets up live drawing scenarios, sketching the space between people. Another artist, Harold Burns, engages participants in contact dance, and invites a crossing of boundaries in and through presence. Neil Marcus invites people to move with him, gently, and blindfolded, and to feel his spastic embodiment and his facility with tender touch. Amber diPietra’s poem about cell movement and the journeys from one to another sounds out in the space, set to music by Mindy Dillard. What I am writing about here is my personal account of the actions I engage in, one facet of these evenings—choreographing participants’ inner experiences.Figure 3. Image: Keira Heu-Jwyn Chang. Performers: Artists in the Burning project. “water burns sun”. Burning. 2009. My desires echo Lorde’s poem: “I want you”—there’s a sensual desire in me when I set up these movement meditation scenes, a delight in an erotic language and voice touch that is not predicated on sexual contact, but on intimacy, and on the borderlines, the membranes of the ear and the skin; ‘to know’—I continue to be intrigued and obsessed, as an artist and as a critic, by the way people envision what goes on inside them, and find agency, poetic lift, in mobilising these knowledges, in reaching from the images of bodies to the life of bodies in the world. ‘your darkness also’—not just the bright light, no, but also the fears and the strengths that hide in the blood and muscle, in the living pulsing shadow of the heart muscle pumping away, in the dark purple lobe of the liver wrapping itself around my middle and purifying, detoxifying, sifting, whatever sweeps through this body.These meditative slow practices can destabilise people. Some report that they experience something quite real, quite deep, and that there is transformation to be gained in these dream journeys. But the framing within which the Burning workshops take place question immediately the “authentic” of this experiential disclosure. The shared, the cultural, the heritage and hidden knowledge of being encultured quickly complicate any essence. This is where the element of formal enframing enters into the immediacy of experience, and into the narration of a stable, autonomous “I.” Our deepest cellular experience, the sounds and movements we listen to when we are deeply relaxed, are still cultured, are still shared, come to us in genres and stable image complexes.This form of presentation also questions practices of self-disclosure that participate in trauma narratives through what Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman has called “impression management” (208). Goffman researched the ways we play ourselves as roles in specific contexts, how we manage acts of disclosure and knowledge, how we deal with stigma and stereotype. Impression management refers to the ways people present themselves to others, using conscious or unconscious techniques to shape their image. In Goffman’s framing of these acts of self-presentation, performance and dramaturgical choices are foregrounded: impression management is an interactive, dynamic process. Disclosure becomes a semiotic act, not a “natural,” unfiltered display of an “authentic” self, but a complex engagement with choices. The naming and claiming of bodily trauma can be part of the repertoire of self-representation, a (stock-)narrative that enables recognition and hence communication. The full traumatic narrative arc (injury, reaction, overcoming) can here be a way to manage the discomfort of others, to navigate potential stigma.In Burning, by-passing verbal self-disclosure and the recitation of experience, by encountering ourselves in dialogue with our insides and with foreign elements in this experiential way, there is less space for people to speak managed, filtered personal truths. I find that these truths tend to either close down communication if raw and direct, or become told as a story in its complete, polished arc. Either form leaves little space for dialogue. After each journey through bodies, cells, through liver and heart, breath and membrane, audience members need to unfold for themselves what they felt, and how that felt, and how that relates to the stories of cancer, environmental toxins and invasion that they know.It is not fair. We should be able to have dialogues about “I am poisoned, I live with environmental sensitivities, and they constrict my life,” “I survived cancer,” “I have multiple sclerosis,” “I am autistic,” “I am addicted to certain substances,” “I am injured by certain substances.” But tragedy tugs at these stories, puts their narrators into the realm of the inviolate, as a community quickly feel sorry for these persons, or else feels attacked by them, in particular if one does not know how to help. Yes, we know this story: we can manage her identity for her, and his social role can click into fixity. The cultural weight of these narratives hinders flow, become heavily stigmatised. Many contemporary writers on the subjects of cancer and personhood recognise the (not always negative) aspects of this stigma, and mobilise them in their narratives. As Marisa Acocella Marchetto in the Cancer-Vixen: A True Story puts it: ‘Play the cancer card!’ (107). The cancer card appears in this graphic novel memoir in the form of a full-page spoof advertisement, and the card is presented as a way to get out of unwanted social obligations. The cancer card is perfectly designed to create the communal cringe and the hasty retreat. If you have cancer, you are beyond the pale, and ordinary rules of behavior do no longer apply. People who experience these life-changing transformational diagnoses often know very well how isolating it can be to name one’s personal story, and many are very careful about how they manage disclosure, and know that if they choose to disclose, they have to manage other people’s discomfort. In Burning, stories of injury and hurt swing in the room with us, all of these stories are mentioned in our performance program, but none of them are specifically given individual voice in our performance (although some participants chose to come out in the sharing circle at the end of the event). No one owns the diagnoses, the identity of “survivor,” and the presence of these disease complexes are instead dispersed, performatively enacted and brought in experiential contact with all members of our temporary group. When you leave our round, you most likely still do not know who has multiple sclerosis, who has substance addiction issues, who is sensitive to environmental toxins.Communication demands territorialisation, and formal experimentation alone, unanchored in lived experience, easily alienates. So how can disclosure and the storytelling self find some lift, and yet some connection, too? How can the Burning cell imaginary become both deep, emotionally rich and formal, pointing to its constructed nature? That’s the question that each of the Olimpias’ community performance experiments begins with.How to Host a Past Collective: Setting Up a CirclePreceding Burning, one of our recent performance investigations was the Anarcha Project. In this multi-year, multi-site project, we revisited gynecological experiments performed on slave women in Montgomery, Alabama, in the 1840s, by J. Marion Sims, the “father of American gynecology.” We did so not to revictimise historical women as suffering ciphers, or stand helpless at the site of historical injury. Instead, we used art-based methods to investigate the heritage of slavery medicine in contemporary health care inequalities and women’s health care. As part of the project, thousands of participants in multiple residencies across the U.S. shared their stories with the project leaders—myself, Aimee Meredith Cox, Carrie Sandahl, Anita Gonzalez and Tiye Giraud. We collected about two hundred of these fragments in the Anarcha Anti-Archive, a website that tries, frustratingly, to undo the logic of the ordered archive (Cox et al. n.p).The project closed in 2008, but I still give presentations with the material we generated. But what formal methods can I select, ethically and responsibly, to present the multivocal nature of the Anarcha Project, given that it is now just me in the conference room, given that the point of the project was the intersection of multiple stories, not the fetishisation of individual ones? In a number of recent presentations, I used a circle exercise to engage in fragmented, shrouded disclosure, to keep privacies safe, and to find material contact with one another. In these Anarcha rounds, we all take words into our mouths, and try to stay conscious to the nature of this act—taking something into our mouth, rather than acting out words, normalising them into spoken language. Take this into your mouth—transgression, sacrament, ritual, entrainment, from one body to another.So before an Anarcha presentation, I print out random pages from our Anarcha Anti-Archive. A number of the links in the website pull up material through chance procedures (a process implemented by Olimpias collaborator Jay Steichmann, who is interested in digital literacies). So whenever you click that particular link, you get to a different page in the anti-archive, and you can not retrace your step, or mark you place in an unfolding narrative. What comes up are poems, story fragments, images, all sent in in response to cyber Anarcha prompts. We sent these prompts during residencies to long-distance participants who could not physically be with us, and many people, from Wales to Malaysia, sent in responses. I pull up a good number of these pages, combined with some of the pages written by the core collaborators of our project. In the sharing that follows, I do not speak about the heart of the project, but I mark that I leave things unsaid. Here is what I do not say in the moment of the presentation—those medical experiments were gynecological operations without anesthesia, executed to close vaginal fistula that were leaking piss and shit, executed without anesthesia not because it was not available, but because the doctor did not believe that black women felt pain. I can write this down, here, in this essay, as you can now stop for a minute if you need to collect yourself, as you listen to what this narrative does to your inside. You might feel a clench deep down in your torso, like many of us did, a kinesthetic empathy that translates itself across text, time and space, and which became a core choreographic element in our Anarcha poetics.I do not speak about the medical facts directly in a face-to-face presentation where there is no place to hide, no place to turn away. Instead, I point to a secret at the heart of the Anarcha Project, and explain where all the medical and historical data can be found (in the Anarcha Project essay, “Remembering Anarcha,” in the on-line performance studies journal Liminalities site, free and accessible to all without subscription, now frequently used in bioethics education (see: http://www.liminalities.net/4-2). The people in the round, then, have only a vague sense of what the project is about, and I explain why this formal frame appears instead of open disclosure. I ask their permission to proceed. They either give it to me, or else our circle becomes something else, and we speak about performance practices and formal means of speaking about trauma instead.Having marked the space as one in which we agree on a specific framework or rule, having set up a space apart, we begin. One by one, raw and without preamble, people in the circle read what they have been given. The meaning of what they are reading only comes to them as they are reading—they have had little time to familiarise themselves with the words beforehand. Someone reads a poem about being held as a baby by one’s mother, being accepted, even through the writer’s body is so different. Someone reads about the persistence of shame. Someone reads about how incontinence is so often the borderline for independent living in contemporary cultures—up to here, freedom; past this point, at the point of leakage, the nursing home. Someone reads about her mother’s upset about digging up that awful past again. Someone reads about fibroid tumors in African-American women. Someone reads about the Venus Hottentott. Someone begins to cry (most recently at a Feminisms and Rhetorics conference), crying softly, and there is no knowing about why, but there is companionship, and quiet contemplation, and it is ok. These presentations start with low-key chatting, setting up the circle, and end the same way—once we have made our way around, once our fragments are read out, we just sit and talk, no “presentation-mode” emerges, and no one gets up into high drama. We’ve all taken strange things into our mouths, talked of piss and shit and blood and race and oppression and love and survival. Did we get free of ourselves, of the inevitability of narrative, in the attention to articulation, elocution, the performance of words, even if just for a moment? Did we taste the words on our tongues, material physical traces of a different form of embodiment? Container/ConclusionThe poet Anne Carson attended one of our Anarcha presentations, and her comments to us that evening helped to frame our subsequent work for me—she called our work creating a container, a vessel for experience, without sharing the specifics of that experience. I have since explored this image further, thought about amphorae as commemorative vases, thought of earth and clay as materials, thought of the illustrations on ancient vessels, on pattern and form, flow and movement. The vessel as matter: deterritorialising and reterritorialising, familiar and strange, shaping into form, and shaped out of formlessness, fired in the light and baked in the earth’s darkness, hardened only to crumble and crack again with the ages, returning to dust. These disclosures are in time and space—they are not narratives that create an archive or a body of knowledge. They breathe, and vibrate, and press against skin.

      "abstract": "Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us what has been shown you of that which is between birth and death,'' thus says Almitra to Almustafa in Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece The Prophet.At the very bottom of my conscience, this cry kept repeating itself during the preparation and writing of this book.And it is in response to this longing for an honest self-understanding of my fellow-citizens that I now with humility present this piece of work.But I am more than aware that truth is not only desired.Truth, especially about ourselves, is always frightening.To reveal it with honesty is very often dangerous and risky.Since the tragic fall of humanity in the Garden of Eden, people cannot stand naked before their fellowhumans.And I now take that risk.Of course, what I have done cannot cover everything 'between birth and death.''The truth shown to me is certainly not the whole truth.But I have no regret.Life is a corporate business.It is enough that I have done my part and others, theirs.This study, thus, is inevitably not only my own achievement, although I alone, and nobody else, is responsible for all its weaknesses and shortcomings.It is more than proper, therefore, for me to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has made this work possible.Unfortunately, it is evident that there are so many institutions and persons involved in the execution of this study that it is impossible to mention them all.It again only shows my limitations, and does not mean that their help has not been significant.My love and thankfulness, first of all, properly go to my dearest wife, Evang, and our dearest son, Arya.If it were not because of her encouragement and patience, this work must not have ever been completed or even started.And if it were not because of Arya's endurance during the five years of our adventurous and sometimes frustrating life, everything must have been unbearable.Their sacrifice, indeed, has been meaningful.Soritua N ababan, of the Council of Churches in Indonesia, and Paul R. Gregory, of the United Church Board of World Ministries, are two names which I will never forget because of their vital support which made these long years of study possible.To them and to the institutions they represent, I owe my greatest debt.Further, I am deeply grateful to Gereja Kristen lndonesiaJawa Barat, Jalan Bekasi Timur IX/6,",

      "title": "4.0: Self-Doubt, the Fear of Failure, and the Power of Symbols",
      "abstract": "My name is Nicole and I am not perfect. I eat way too much junk food, I never return telephone calls and I say all the wrong things at all the wrong times. I am okay with that; I can deal with the fact that I am carrying around some extra chunk or that my friends think that I am flaky, but what I cannot deal with is failure. Although is considered to be unacceptable and of great disappointment in our society, my definition of failure, and even that of success, differs greatly from those who surround me. This, according to Herbert Blumer and his symbolic interactionist perspective, is the result of interpretation, the idea that human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings that the things have for them (Wallace and Wolf, 217). The term failure can be seen as being highly ambiguous and each individual possesses a different meaning for the word, which will ultimately have an impact on the way he or she views a situation involving failure. For example, in the article, Exiting the Self-Destructive Highway: A Sociological Path Back to a Future Career, UMass Boston student Paul Conner states that he deliberately do things to derail any progress in his (Conner, 137), showing that to him, was an inability to get ahead. However, for me, the meaning of is much more complex and has become a major issue in my life, one that has become extremely overwhelming, causing immense anxiety and, in turn, is almost unbearable to handle. The movie Twelve Angry Men also provides us with an understanding of how people can view situations differently based on their preconceptions, backgrounds and interpretations. This film tells the story of twelve jurors who make sense of everyday life each from their own standpoint and eventually attempt to put themselves in the shoes of an eighteen year old boy who is accused of committing the murder of his father. It is not until the jurors take the steps of putting themselves in each other's shoes and really understanding one another that the votes begin to change and the jury is able to make a verdict regarding the boy's guilt. I am hoping that by writing this research paper, I will be able to step back and gain a deeper understanding of an issue that has left me constantly trying to prove to myself and others that I can be better, do better and accomplish more. My continuing struggle with the belief that I am completely incapable of success has resulted in an enormous amount of self-doubt that leaves me questioning my abilities each time I have an assignment to complete. For a moment, or even as I write this research paper, I would like to take on a phenomenological approach and set aside the thoughts and ideas that I have constructed regarding failure, and instead question the very things I have taken for granted. Following this perspective, I will assume the role of a stranger, like a visitor from a foreign country (Wallace and Wolf, 262). In doing so, I will attempt to disregard the patterns and routines that I have become accustomed to in order to understand why it is that I have such an extreme fear of failure, where it came from and how I can find a resolution. In doing this research, I plan to use concepts associated with various sociological perspectives seeking to explore the relationship between my individual experiences (personal troubles) and the larger society (public issues). The sociologist C. Wright Mills called the ability to recognize such a link between micro and macro social processes, the sociological imagination. I think it would be appropriate to rewind about eight years and re-visit the end of my senior year in high school and into my time spent in community college in order to make sense of my life before my fear of erupted. I left high school and entered community college with the purpose of proving that I was different--different than the rest of my family. …",

      "abstract": "Listening to stories of suffering can be difficult, painful, and even traumatic.\r\nYet listen we do and listen we must. If we do not hear or bear witness to these stories,\r\nthen we are rendered incapable of responding, of answering for our or other’s\r\nactions, of taking a position of responsibility. Thus listening is central to the ways\r\nin which educational projects of social justice are conceived. Within these projects\r\nthere is a legitimate focus on listening to the voices of the marginalized and the\r\nwounded, and on giving space and time to those groups to articulate their own\r\nexperiences, struggles, dilemmas, and needs. In the context of teaching and learning\r\nencounters, students are often exposed to narratives that offer them radically\r\ndifferent experiences from their own and when these experiences are marked by\r\nsuffering, their responses can cut across a range of emotional registers: solidarity,\r\npity, empathy, desire, identification, and guilt, to name a few. Such responses reveal\r\nsome of the ways students “receive” the other and the degree to which they become\r\nhosts, as it were, to the other’s narrative presence.",

      "abstract": "The process and stresses of moving home are a common experience in our lives, and few find sorting and packing household possessions easy. When moves are temporary, uncertain or contingent on other factors it can be particularly difficult to know what to take with us, so renting a self-storage unit allows for movement and mobility without the need to reduce the material convoy or make premature decisions on what to keep or dispose of. Contrary to previous research, which has focused on the purchase or divestment of objects during life course transitions, house moves and experiences of mobility, this paper argues that the practice of storing objects is equally as important. The data for this paper is drawn from object-elicited interviews undertaken in the UK with three women who were motivated to rent self-storage to store their household possessions when moving to a new home temporarily or more permanently, across the country and abroad, in the pursuit of different opportunities (education, work, lifestyle change). Self-storage is seen to both accommodate materiality caught up in feelings of uncertainty and indecision, and anchor possessions which collectively stand-in for a sense of home when itself is not yet remade.",

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>The trauma of losing a sibling when we are in our adult years is one of the most unrecognized and undertreated areas of psychology. There is no other loss in adult life that appears to be so neglected as the death of a brother or sister, says bereavement specialist and psychologist, Therese Rando. And Rando is just one expert author Berman interviews in this moving book about loss. We see here how, when an adult dies, the parents, spouse, and children of that person become the focus, but brothers and sisters most often fall to the sidelines and are left to find a way to deal with the grief and recover alone. Yet, when a brother or sister dies, we lose our longest lifetime companion, someone with whom we have shared an intimate family history. And, in most cases, that was someone for whom we had conflicted feelings: shared identity yet competitive feelings, pride yet jealousy, love yet hate. Most of us come to make peace with the relationship at some point. How to make peace with the death of the sibling - which can conjure up a well of feelings, from wishing you were closer to wanting to change some past events you shared - can haunt an adult. But author Claire Berman, who lost her own sister to heart disease in the week of September 11, 2001, when America lost its innocence, takes us into the emotional world of sibling loss, showing us how to understand and navigate the aftermath of a loss that can leave adults feeling angry, confused, guilty, empty, or just like Berman, wanting to hit that speed dial button still marked with her sister’s name.</JATS1:p>",

      "title": "Telling the Truth as WPA",
      "abstract": "A Al-Anon meetings I learned that alcoholics lie and their families lie, too.22 None of us call it lying, of course: we call it being nice, or avoiding trouble, or keeping the peace. Usually, it’s not overt out-and-out lying, but rather minimizing (“It’s not that bad”), blaming some other entity (“It’s his father’s fault”), denial (“She’s really very smart, but school doesn’t challenge her”), or delusion (“Some day I’ll figure out how to please her”). To see the reality of one’s life requires working through all these stages to discover which facts have been omitted from the narrative. Only then can one take responsibility for oneself and one’s happiness, letting go of responsibility for any other adult’s life. No one in Al-Anon or AA would ever say learning this is easy or accomplished overnight. Serving as a writing program administrator, I’ve found, requires the same dedication to reality and to telling the truth about that reality—especially if one is to maintain sanity in the midst of English department delusions. It often falls to the Director of Composition to explain to both students and teachers that their own choices have consequences and that different choices are available. But how do you do that? How does a writing program administrator tell the truth? In this essay, I share what I’ve learned about truth telling in my experience as an administrator: assistant director of composition for a year in graduate school; associate director when I was an assistant professor; and writing program administrator at three large universities in the south. Of my thirty years in higher education, I’ve served 151⁄2 as some kind of administrator, eight of those here at Kennesaw State University in Atlanta’s northern suburbs. It is ironic that in using my own experience to write about the ethics of telling the truth, professional ethics require me to omit details and disguise others. Truth is more complicated than it appears, as any rhetorician knows.",

Uncertainties associated with the availability of resources, the occurrence of events along the way, and ultimately with goal achievement are undesired inconveniences, tolerated at best. But then there are the odd occasions when we want to be surprised, to be held in suspense, to discover the unknown. It seems, especially in Western societies, that there is a growing tendency to oscillate between these two attitudes towards uncertainty. While for the most part, we wish to control our lives and our environment in ever increasing detail and to cover the uncontrollable by insurances of various kinds, at certain times we seek adventure in ever more extreme forms. The financial crisis – unfolding as the writing of this book was in its final stages – seems to indicate that a few people have made a very good living out of their need for adventure, while the rest of us suffer, as our economic and psychological foundations of certainty and control are shaken.KeywordsSafety CulturePsychological ContractEmployment RelationshipLoose CouplingCollaborative PlanningThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "Words, Worlds, and Addictions",
      "abstract": "Words, Worlds, and Addictions George Graham (bio) Keywords agency, resignation, time travel, types of addictive patterns, unwillingness, valuation With Latin as its semantic pedigree, ‘addiction’ derives from addictio, to give over, to surrender. If I am addicted to something, then I am given over to it. I surrender to it. Many good things in life are well worth giving oneself over to. I surrender myself to love for my family, a passion for philosophy, the awesome beauties of Mother Nature, the intricacies of sonnets by Shakespeare, and the warmth of reminiscing about shared histories with old friends. Of course, we persons have to be careful about both the subjects or foci and the styles or manners of our acts of surrender. ‘Addiction’ itself is a medical or mental health term with the connotation partly of, as Jesse Summers aptly points out, an addict’s valuing (or surrendering to) the wrong things or in the wrong way. I may begin drinking alcohol to enhance life’s joys or to dull its sorrows. But heavy drinking may threaten my physical health, financial stability, family, and friendships. Depending on an addiction’s severity and my social conditions, it may not be possible for me on my own to pull back or away from the harmful consequences of an addictive behavior pattern. Why am I unable to pull away? No doubt, there are rather different explanations for different cases, people, and situations. Potent stimuli for indulging the impulse to drink may sneak up on me, despite memories of drinking’s negative consequences. Or, if significant people in my social world are drinkers, smokers, or gamblers, it may be too difficult for me to construct or maintain a healthy balance in behavior. I may fear the loss of the social capital of my friendships if I do not drink or gamble with my buddies. Other reasons or causes may also obtain. Different contents, foci, or subjects of addiction may produce different challenges to my motivational system. Heroin. Cocaine. Alcohol. Gambling. Inhalants. Nicotine. Fattening foods. Challenges may occur at all levels: phenomenological, neurological, and social. To assume a monorail-like sameness about the causal trajectories or powers of such foci may be like assuming a deep similarity between baseball and hockey or London, England, and London, Ontario. Surface resemblances between powers should be discharged in favor of real facts about explanatory forces. Summers is sensitive to addiction’s nuances, ranges, and intensifications. In this commentary, I add a few complementary suggestions for his analysis, ones that I hope are helpful. Summers may wish to distinguish between different types of addiction. I mean types distinguished not in terms of the subjects or foci of addiction (heroin, gambling, etc.), but in terms of the manner or style in which an addict’s motivational [End Page 45] system is connected with an addictive behavior pattern. The unwilling addict who wishes and tries, on occasion, to quit but may fail or relapse offers a pattern of behavior that is an exemplar of addiction. Or so I assume (Graham 2013, 177–202; Stephens and Graham 2009). But there can be merit in referring to other sorts of addictions, such as willing, wanton, or resigned addictions, which are designations that sometimes appear in the literature (see Kennett 2013). Although these types are departures from exemplary unwillingness, they are not necessarily contradictions in terms or taxonomic aberrations, provided that the type-specific parameters for the application of such concepts are specified empirically. Each type may pose different conceptual demands on a theory of addiction and stymie certain generalizations across all types. Take, for example, the so-called resigned addict. Someone perhaps too filled with fatigue, self-loathing, or a lack of confidence to even try to control their devotion to something that is harmful for them. Why decide that someone is a resigned addict? Perhaps, in part, this is because of the individual’s personal testimony. The addict may report his or her giving up the effort to control against their harmful behavior. “Why bother?” they may say. Such an addict’s world, as Neil Levy puts matters, may be without sufficient incentive to try to exercise “effortful self-control...",

We experience the tension between the wish to join together and the wish to be separate; between the need for togetherness and belonging and the need for an independent identity. Many of the puzzling phenomena of group life stem from this, and it is often difficult to recognize the more frequent reality of mutual interdependence. No man is an island, and yet we wish to believe we are independent of forces of which we may not be conscious, either from outside ourselves or from within. At times we are aware of these pulls within ourselves; at other times they overwhelm us and become the source of irrational group behaviour. While most obvious in crowds and large meetings, these same forces also influence smaller groups, such as teams and committees. This chapter will focus on groups at work, and how they are affected by unconscious processes.",

How do you respond? Do you tell a story, do you remark 'this is impossible', or do you suggest the possibility of a correspondence between yourself and this unexpected other? Speaking of phantasms then, of the demands of memory, the call of mnemosyne, and what the other causes to appear, we seek to orientate ourselves around the contours of the impossible, that which we call love, remaining as a third and invisible presence which seeks to record and give form to an imagined dialogue.",

      "title": "Facing limitation and failure: four literary portraits.",
      "abstract": "The four stories presented above deal with several ways physicians respond to the experience of limitation, failure, and loss. They may seek solace in the mistakes of others, or cultivate a cynical outlook, or bargain for the time to figure things out, or become angry and project their failure on other forces, or lament their fallibility in the face of assuming responsibility. At the same time, the physicians in the stories grieve the loss of persons entrusted to their care, experiencing sadness and sometimes the urge for recrimination. The broadest common message of these fictional portraits of failure seems to be that while to err is human, it is equally human to struggle against error by trying to account for it, explain it, or prevent it the next time. Literature holds out little hope for eliminating or avoiding failures and mistakes, but in the unblinking accuracy and complexity of emotion with which it displays physicians coming to terms with failure, literature is on the side of understanding and empathy.",

There is no guarantee that reading this book is going to bring you new insights or take away your problems, but it will take away several conditionings and belief systems so you finally understand that there is no path to follow to find liberation. Nobody can tell you what to do or where to go. You may discover that your true nature is so much more than you always imagined it to be, and that your awareness is not limited to the function of your brain, but that it goes beyond the limitations of your body and mind. From that discovery, a lot of concepts and beliefs are put in perspective which may bring you peace of mind. You may rediscover infinity in the simplicity of everyday life. And when all illusions are taken away, life may become simpler.",

      "abstract": "Arrogance is to think of oneself as superior and superior and to look down on others. Arrogance is caused by several factors, namely: charity and knowledge, lineage, beauty, strength, wealth, lineage, and others. Pride occurs a lot, for example in the family, school, community environment, and anywhere. They act arrogant because they are used to living like that. In the family, for example, parents always accustom their children to always be arrogant. An arrogant person likes praise, he wants to always occupy the top position, doesn't want to be advised, thinks he is the most righteous. Even though such an attitude is not justified in association, especially in Islam. Allah really hates people who act arrogantly, anyone who cannot get rid of that trait, Allah will put him in the most despicable place, namely hell. A person can change, as long as he really wants to change it, namely by believing in the Qur'an, the way to do it is by reading it and understanding the meaning contained in it. Then by memorizing the Qur'an, because by memorizing one's heart will always be close to the Qur'an, do not have time and do not want to do things that can damage faith. And of course the clarity about this arrogance has been explained below in the form of thematic hadith.

This child’s dread-charged awe before the Stranger brings into focus the tension fundamental to our lives—our being torn between openness to the unprecedented future and the desire to protect ourselves from it. Dialoguing with Loewald, Freud, and Heidegger, I consider the radical anxiety the child experiences when exposed to the dreadful not—the absence of the needed. Dialoguing with Aristotle, I discuss how wonder draws the child into harmonious play with alterities that are intelligible to her. However, from the beginning the child is surrounded by alterities whose transcendence overwhelms her. We recoil from such transcendence because it fills us with dread, are drawn to it because it fills us with awe. Dread-charged awe in the face of the other, especially the human Other, is, I argue, the quintessential human experience.",

Kage was bringing his feeling of the futility of mourning to his attention: hope for help from me, yet resignation that no hope was possible.

Even with my high and mighty ethical aspirations that I wear like a badge, I will only know when a moment has passed, that I was able to stand by what I felt my beliefs about existence to be. Or not. What follows, is a conversation between old friends. My experience of being a PC therapist is often agonizing and fraught in a precarious and yet fertile landscape, and for that I am thankful. If any therapy takes place, it does so by accident as a by-product of person-to-person encounter: an accident that gives way to a contingent birthing. This contingency is profoundly embedded in a kind of inter-random process, based on a radical ethic that may well betray the party-line and assumed social order. Exploring ideas from the therapeutic realm along with those from literature and philosophy, this chapter will be in praise of precariousness, and challenge the misunderstanding and frequent disregard for the radical ethics implicit in a person-centred attitude towards the organism.",

      "abstract": "By failing to prepare, we are preparing to fail. Most of us will one day row old and frail. Some will be fortunate enough to be endowed with wealth and good health in retirement years. But others in fact many of us, some call it the 99% group, will not be so fortune. We may have wealth but not health. We may be healthy but not wealthy. Many will probably have enough income to put food and drink on the table, and roof over the head, but will there be enough to cover unexpected expenses? Can we depend on our children to financially and/or physically take care of us in our golden years? They too will likely be facing similar problems-soaring costs of housing, children’s education, lifestyle upgrading, busy schedule etc.making it less likely that we can depend on them for assistance.\r\nRetirement planning is dynamic and holistic. We are not just planning to build up wealth and good health, we must also plan to protect our wealth and health. When planning for retirement, all risks that we might face must be understood at the outset and strategies to mitigate them must be worked out. Some risks are almost certain, like inflation and for most of us, outliving our savings. Others are less certain such as the need to be nursed and cared over an extended period of time. Whose responsibilities are those risks? Are they responsibility of the State? Should we take control of our own destiny and affair? Does each individual have enough means to provide for all those eventualities.\r\nWhen planning for retirement, we must take consideration of what we can expect of the State and our employers when determining the shortfall which must come from our own means, be it from our savings or from our extended family members. Some of these provisions for retirement are more efficiently organised by pooling through the concept of mutual help, others may be best provided for through individual savings.\r\nThis paper will address the needs as we grow older, identify the likely gaps and suggest ways and means of how best we share and meet these needs as an individual and as a nation. It is not enough for a great nation to merely add new years to life, it must also work to add new life to those years.",

New centres of learning have been established and old ones have been subverted, not least by an overdose of political zeal. The sciences of man have developed – more painfully than was hoped and with fewer concrete results than was (and is) desired. I think we have learned that our efforts to understand complex social and political structures (including those constituted by governments and oppositions) may themselves founder (or flounder) in complexities. Some of those complexities are endemic to the subject of our study; others are the result of our own confusion of categories or of premature conceptualization; others result from overspecialization – and others from the hazards of cross-disciplinary study. Perhaps the cardinal error has been to seek too much – and expect too much – from a narrowly ‘scientific’ approach. We all know of cases on the heads of which one or other of these caps can fit.",

To conceive an idea, and plan its development, and then to carry it out in material completes the creative process. Therein lies a thrill comparable to no other experience. It is the embodiment of self-satisfaction, and brings about the release that comes with adequate self-expression. Difficulties seem to stand in the way of this kind of accomplishment. There is, perhaps, nothing to work with and little money to spend. Another stumbling block is that of lack of confidence in one's ability to plan and design. Both of these barriers may be easily overcome. It is possible to make very lovely things out of scraps of this and that, out of newspapers, and other waste material. The five-and-ten cent store offers a copious supply of fascinating mediums. As for planning and designing, such ability grows apace with experience. (And to make objects without art quality is wasteful, for a thing of beauty, though it need cost no more than a commonplace thing, has value. Moreover, to miss the opportunity for personal interpretation is to miss real satisfaction.) The main factor is to start. Start simply. One idea follows another. The first conception which is carried to successful completion will bring others in its wake. The process is accumulative, and the more one does, the more one can do. Let us begin very simply. Not only is there a close relationship between simplicity and beauty, but it is sensible and logical to proceed from the simple to the more complex. The following suggestions for creative occupational therapy are basic but adaptable for use among those of varying age, experience, and skill. Included are ideas that are unusual, that have art merit, and that are inexpensive to carry out. After a little experience the creative designer should find many other worth-while uses for these everyday materials.",

Participants were asked to express the circumstances that usually trigger a saudade experience, the feelings they usually associate with the experience, and the main coping strategies they usually try to implement when confronted with the experience. The saudade experience was conceived to be primarily triggered in situations of spatial or spatial-temporal distancing from significant individuals. The emotion most often mentioned directly was sadness. During saudade, some people try to sustain the emotion in different ways, for example by approaching objects that may prolong it; others tend to get rid of the emotion as quickly as possible, and still others tend to accept the experience and do nothing special to change it. The use of quantitative tools showed that the usual strength of the saudade experience was close to the maximum value.",

      "abstract": "Mourning is an essential aspect of psychological and spiritual growth in individuals and of political growth within organizations and nations. A good mourning, including elements of reminiscence, sadness, and anger, readies us to go on with an openness to new possibilities. Mourning also requires us to examine and come to terms with our own relationship with the lost object or experience. Failure to mourn, on the other hand, evokes defenses like denial, demands for restoration of that which never fully was, or submission to a nostalgia that maintains attachment to the lost and now idealized object. Here, I delineate between healthy and foreclosed mourning. The role of nostalgia as an entry into mourning or a defense against it is discussed. The consequences of failure to mourn losses are exemplified in a former patient, the Roman Catholic Church, and in the United States post-9/11.",

Some of us hardly react to the shifting ambiance on any given day; we carry our own weather with us. Others of us become saturated by the mood and environment that cloaks us. Those buffeted by stormy challenges or adrift in strong currents need a buoy, a life preserver. One way to identify our own buoy in schools is to choose sayings, poems, favorite quotes, and self- affirmations that can remind us of our priorities. Another is to have a set of principles that ground us. Adapted from the physician’s Hippocratic oath, the Teacher’s Creed may help us in times of rough seas. Imagine how these intentions could be touchstones for being our best in schools. 1. Non- maleficence: Do no harm. 2. Beneficence: Do good. 3. Justice: Treat fairly. 4. Autonomy: Honor self- determination and the right to choose. Do no harm. We commit ourselves to the intent to do no harm (emotionally, physically, spiritually, academically) for all con­stituents in our schools. Do good. We act on the commitment to nurture and inspire learning for the benefit of all in our schools. Treat fairly. “Fair” and “just” have many layers. Fair is not necessarily equal, and justice is likely debatable. Most impor­tant is our commitment to stay open to the evolving meanings and treatments that constitute fair and just for our students and co- workers. Honor self- determination and the right to choose. We acknowledge that we may never know what is best for another, and the other may have the right to be wrong. Allowing another to determine what she/ he wants and needs can be wrenching. Yet acknowledging the sovereign will of others propels growth, no matter our age.",

Often enough in my life I have done things I had not decided to do. Something—whatever that may be—goes into action; it goes to the woman I don't want to see anymore, it makes the remark to the boss that costs me my head, it keeps on smoking although I have decided to quit, and then quits smoking just when I've accepted the fact that I'm a smoker and always will be. I don't mean to say that thinking and reaching decisions have no influence on behavior. But behavior does not merely enact whatever has already been thought through and decided.

      "abstract": "The pandemic has placed us in a situation of estrangement from ourselves. We have been acutely aware of our vulnerability and fragility. Through the stories of lived experiences, we have learned about and witnessed tragic circumstances in which inhospitality and neglect have become evident. We have been shocked by the awareness of the lack of recognition, accompaniment and welcome. Institutional decisions have prioritized public health, the good for all, but have forgotten the biographies of people, full of suffering. And this has produced a moral damage, a loss of trust, a feeling of injustice that we have not been able to fight against. This is why it is necessary to build hospitality, which can be achieved through care. Care with a political dimension that takes charge of reality and transforms society. The key is a responsibility in solidarity. Faced with the possibility of dehumanizing ourselves, we seek hospitality as an alternative way of narrating lives that have to be reconstructed, that have to relearn how to take care of each other amidst the multiple possibilities of estrangement that threaten us. Hospitality is at the heart of a narrative ethics at the height of our times.La pandemia nos ha colocado en una situación de extrañamiento hacia nosotros mismos. Hemos sido muy conscientes de nuestra vulnerabilidad y fragilidad. A través de los relatos de las experiencias vividas hemos conocido y asistido a circunstancias trágicas en las que se han puesto de manifiesto lo inhóspito y el descuido. Nos ha conmocionado la toma de conciencia sobre la falta de reconocimiento, de acompañamiento, de acogida. Las decisiones institucionales han primado la Salud Pública, el bien de todos, pero se han olvidado de las biografías de las personas, llenas de sufrimiento. Y esto ha producido un daño moral, una pérdida de la confianza, una sensación de injusticia ante la que no se ha podido luchar. Por eso es necesaria una construcción de la hospitalidad que se puede lograr a través del cuidado. Un cuidado con dimensión política que se haga cargo de la realidad y que transforme la sociedad. La clave es una responsabilidad solidaria. Ante la posibilidad de deshumanizarnos buscamos la hospitalidad como forma alternativa de narrar las vidas que tienen que reconstruirse, que tienen que reaprender cómo cuidarnos mutuamente en medio de las múltiples posibilidades de extrañamiento que nos amenazan. La hospitalidad es el corazón de una ética narrativa a la altura de nuestro tiempo.",

      "title": "The Problem of Historical Variability",
      "abstract": "This essay explores a pervasive and disconcerting worry about intellectual life: our controversial beliefs regarding morals, politics, religion, and philosophy depend on facts about our personal history. The circumstances of the past clearly have a great impact on our present situation and outlook. This is sometimes called “the weight of history.” It’s like the weight of the atmosphere. It is unthinkably huge, we couldn’t live without it, and we rarely pause to think about it. What’s worrisome here is that there is apparently something accidental or arbitrary about having any particular history and this strongly suggests that the beliefs that are influenced by our historical backgrounds are sometimes rationally problematic. Historical variability (or, more briefly, variability) is the term I will give to the idea that our disputed convictions vary with different backgrounds. Many of us have entertained worries about historical variability. Such worries may shape our intellectual views, shading particular matters with skepticism. Or variability may remain a source of disquiet, a threat to our cherished convictions. Either way, variability has not received sustained philosophical attention. Now and again, thinkers point toward it, but pointing is typically all we get—worked-out arguments based on variability are uncommon. My main concern here is to introduce and also to begin to defend some well-developed variability arguments. In a sense, what I will call the ‘historical variability problem’ has a double meaning: variability challenges our beliefs, all right, but there is also some difficulty in seeing what the problem really is.

      "abstract": "Winding Down, Living OnThe Future in Old Age Avril Tynan (bio) There is, of course, lots of life after death; it is just not one’s own. — Regina M. Janes, Inventing Afterlives (2018) Living in the Past In Rhetoric, Aristotle’s (1984) deliberation on the art of persuasion, he contends that the moral and emotional characteristics of human beings are not ubiquitous but configured across three distinct stages of life: youth, the prime of life, and old age. The lives of young men, Aristotle argues, are mainly spent not in memory but in expectation, for expectation refers to the future, memory to the past, and youth has a long future before it and a short past behind it: on the first day of one’s life one has nothing at all to remember, and can only look forward. (II.12, 1389a21–5) [End Page 47] Elderly men, on the other hand live by memory rather than by hope; for what is left to them of life is but little as compared with the long past; and hope is of the future, memory of the past. This, again, is the cause of their loquacity; they are continually talking of the past, because they enjoy remembering it. (II.13, 1390a6–10) This bleak treatise of old age is locked into Aristotle’s teleologically bound view of human life that runs from birth to any number of possible forms of death and is grounded in ambivalent Ancient Greek patriarchal traditions that, while often portraying the aged as the embodiment of wisdom, nevertheless idealize the physical and emotional strength of adult men. As Aristotle continues, emphasizing the virtuous archetype of middle adulthood, men in their prime “have a character between that of the young and that of the old, free from the extremes of either” (II.14, 1390a29–31). While he does not explicitly mention the relationship between memory and middle age, we can assume that men in the prime of life satisfy a midpoint between memory and hope, or between reminiscence and expectation. Although this meditation on the characteristics of different ages comes amid Aristotle’s far wider philosophical contemplation on the effective rhetorician and his understanding and use of three technical elements of communication— ethos, logos, and pathos, of which the notion of character is most pertinent to the latter— it develops a grimly pessimistic vision of old age. To Aristotle, the elderly are selfish, cowardly, cynical, distrustful, and contemptuous; they think only of what is good for themselves, and not what is “good absolutely” (II.13, 1390a2). Old age, in this extraordinarily miserable formulation, has no interest in the future; hope is for the young, for they still have a life to live. Today, the inevitability of aging stands as a challenge to cultural and socioeconomic pressures: popular culture conflates and venerates happiness with the cult of youth; medical science seeks to prolong life and beauty, at times with outright contempt for moral sensibilities; and the instrumental losses associated with a decline in productivity designate the elderly as a financial burden. The commercialization of the anti-aging culture selling the dream of eternal youth has seized upon the [End Page 48] increase in life expectancies in the global North so that capitalism has fed the plethora of negative stereotypes that surround arbitrary designations of “old” or “aged” (Baars 2012), contributing to the rapid rise of what the World Health Organization terms “elder abuse.”1 Society’s search for the fountain of youth is no longer the subject of myth and legend but the bedrock of capitalist expansion.2 In this article, I turn against the negative characterizations of aging and ask if it is possible to consider old age not as the deleterious nadir of a life, where only the past bears weight, but rather as a meaningful and future-oriented position within an individual and a communal life story. The idea that old age signifies a loss of future in both a temporal and a tangible sense implicates it as an optimal position for a retrospectively inclined narrative understanding of life that draws on a wealth of memory to satisfy meaning. Yet this view is incompatible with contemporary hermeneutically...",

Advent arrives with the words “watch” and “be ready.” If there are any Advent celebrations, they are done in moderation because that is the only way we can watch and be alert. Most New Year’s celebrations are about surviving to the end of another year. They are about forgetting the past.Advent is a about expectation. Watch. Be ready. Be alert.

Cybersex in any form offers a distraction to temporarily cope with negative thoughts or problems in your life, as the activity offers the ability to absorb oneself into the Internet and its various adult sites, giving you a means to relax and temporarily feel good about yourself. Over time, a fun habit develops into a compulsive obsession. At this stage, life becomes unmanageable as relationships or careers are jeopardized because of the compulsive behavior. Longer periods of time are spent searching for new pornographic images or mingling in adult chat rooms. Cybersex no longer seems to be a voluntary act, but a sexual act that must be completed.",

People laugh, but not necessarily at you, or at anything funny. When a gifted child is around laughter, the motive for this behavior may have nothing to do with the gifted one, and need not be taken personally. Since thinking in depth is often done with a frowning look, cultivating smiles and humor are worthy pasttimes for gifted boys and girls. So many reasons have been given for causing underachievement. More often than not it is accompanied by heartache for many. It seems curious to add that if fear of being laughed at is seen as one of the variables, an added avenue of exploration is present.",

      "title": "Living With Other Gods",
      "abstract": "In lieu of an abstract, below is the essay's first paragraph. America the melting pot,” how many times have we heard this remark, yet it is so true. It is a diverse melting pot of many people, cultures, and religions. Diversity can lead either to intolerance or to acceptance. It is up to us, as Homo sapiens, or wise humans to accept the latter. This however comes with a challenge, for we are compelled to defend ourselves in the face or ignorance and cruelty. We live in a very complex country and time, yet we face the same problems that humans all over the world and different eras have. Even though we are all humans, it is hard to accept another person at a same level as us, and it is hard to comprehend that those who are different from us, share the same emotions and feelings as ourselves. We are also sometimes afraid to share our life with those who have other gods or a different God. Religion plays an important part in human life and affects millions of people worldwide. This great worldwide variety of religious devotion indicates that for thousands of years, humanity has had a spiritual need and yearning. Man has lived with his trials and burdens, his doubts and questions, including the enigma of death. Religious feelings have been expressed in many different ways as people have turned towards God or their gods, seeking blessings and solace. With the wide diversity of religious expression that has developed around the world over the past 6,000 years, it is at least educational and mind broadening to understand what others believe and how their beliefs originated. After all, all religions try to answer the same questions raised by humankind: Why are we here? How should we live? Where do we go after we die? In many countries now, owing to immigration and population movement, people of different religions share the same neighborhood. Therefore understanding one another’s viewpoint can lead to more meaningful communications and conversations between people of different faiths. It may also decrease some of the hatred in this world based on religious differences. People may strongly disagree about their religious beliefs, but there is no basis for hating a person just because he or she holds a different viewpoint. The ancient Jewish law stated, ‘You shall not hate your kinfolks in your heart. Reprove your relative but incur no guilt because of him. You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your countrymen. Love you fellows as yourself: I am Lord” (Leviticus 19:17-18 Ta). In addition, the founder of Christianity stated, “But I say to you who are listening, Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those who are hurting you...your reward will be great...” (Luke 6:27). The Qur’an, the holy book of Islam, also states a similar principle. “It may be that Allah will bring about friendship between you and those whom you hold as enemies...and Allah is powerful, forgiving, and most merciful” (Surah 60:7). When it comes to worship, God himself should not determine what is and is not acceptable.

Its inquiry does not ask what it really means or a getting into the bottom of things. There is no bottom, just the middle bits. Its question is an invitation to ponder and fold into at least three dance moves: (a) to attend to the not-yet-ness of things, places and possibilities; (b) to rest in presence, fully stuck in the here and now; and (c) to find returns, detours, and dead-ends with deep intent.

No doubt, the devastation of minds and bodies I witnessed in Europe during World War II influenced my understanding of trauma and how I relate to it. My sense of my own un-integration and my interest in trauma and altered states eventually led me to become a psychoanalyst. Over the course of my life, I have been with so many people who suffer from different disorders of self; ranging from struggles in being a coherent self, to lacking the feeling of any sense of self or identity. Maybe the one thing we have to remember is that being with people and talking with them in the right way can make all the difference. Contrary to the usual pessimism encountered these days, I am optimistic about the future of psychoanalysis because I cannot believe that healing through meeting and talk in the analytic setting can ever be replaced.",

Our thought processes determine how we behave, the decisions we make and even what we think of ourselves. If those thought processes have been heavily influenced by negative people, then even if we strive to be positive and work hard at self-development it can be a long uphill climb to rid ourselves of destructive thought patterns. A person who wants change and a person who does not want change are not really compatible. But everything is always changing. Accepting this is what separates the movers-and-shakers from the stuck-in-a-rutters. It is natural to seek advice and listen to the opinions of others when making big life changes, but beware of unsolicited advice. One of the most potentially damaging spheres of influence is the media. Social media can be particularly dangerous, as it is so open to abuse.",

      "title": "Drift en grip",
      "abstract": "Gedurende de eerste dagen na de geboorte is de kracht van de grijpreflex van de baby niet te evenaren. Nadien zullen we nooit meer met een hand ons eigen gewicht kunnen dragen. In die vroegste periode grijpt de baby zich bovendien vast aan alles wat maar met zijn handjes in aanraking komt, of dat nu een grotemensenvinger is of gelijk welk prul. De pasgeborene zoekt gretig houvast in de nog weinig gedifferentieerde wereld. Dat houvast als zodanig is belangrijker dan de aard van het object dat zich ertoe leent. Al na een half jaar is de grijpreflex helemaal verdwenen en heeft hij plaatsgemaakt voor een meer doelgericht grijpen. De aard van het object gaat dan een rol spelen, er ontstaan voorkeuren in de pogingen grip te krijgen op de wereld. We kunnen ons echter de vraag stellen of ook na het verdwijnen van de grijpreflex onze onuitroeibare nood aan houvast niet altijd iets behoudt van zijn oorspronkelijke ongerichtheid. Vooral in gevaarsituaties grijpen we ons als een volleerde baby vast aan eender welk object dat ons pad of onze voorstellingen kruist. Als zijn hele leven hem dreigt te ontglippen zoekt Vincent, de amateuralpinist uit de Nederlandse roman Grip van Stephan Enter, wanhopig houvast aan de kleinste oneffenheid in een steile klifwand in Engeland. Bijna aan de bovenrand gekomen, verliest hij echter greep op de situatie. Hij klemt zich zo krampachtig vast dat zijn knokkels wit worden, zijn hele lichaam trilt van misselijk makende angst. Pas als zijn angst geweken is, kan loslaten een optie worden. Daarnaast hebben we ook onze zeer persoonlijke onwrikbare overtuigingen, waar we ons angstvallig aan vastklampen en die we ons niet laten ontnemen. Zo laat ook de van zijn eigen gelijk overtuigde dwangneuroticus zich niet van de wijs brengen en zal hij iedereen die daar pogingen toe doet, bijvoorbeeld een psychoanalyticus of psychotherapeut, angstvallig op afstand houden. En ook als analyticus zelf kunnen we even halsstarrig gehecht zijn aan ons theoretisch of klinisch gelijk.",

A person may, for instance, have a great interest in railroads, pictures, landscapes, clothes or flowers. However, such an interest never remains in the sphere of contemplation alone. It sooner or later leads to actions. The person interested in landscapes will have to travel in order to see them or at least have to go to places where painting and pictures are exhibited, or he may have to paint and photograph them himself. The person interested in technical problems will sooner or later start to construct, or at least to collect. Interests of this type may be worth while and may mean the lifework or",

As adults we know that insomnia is commonplace, and we do what we can to fend it off. Children, however, often rail at the realization that despite bedtime stories, snacks, lullabies, backrubs, in the end they are on their own. They are frequently bewildered that we cannot make them sleep. Even if adults offer suggestions (the famous sheep counting, or prayers or reading), children must actively choose to invest themselves in the strategy. Often they rebel, refusing all suggestions, insisting they have tried them all, and they just don't work.",

Antonio Damasio, 'Some Notes on Brain, Imagination and Creativity', 2001, p. 64. It is commonly said that in order to be able to drive a car well we have to stop thinking about it. If we focus too much on the vehicle and how we're operating it – how the gears work or which pedal to press when – we're likely to end up in a ditch. The process has to become automatic. Somehow, and sooner rather than later, we have to reach the stage in which we're no longer consciously concerned about where we put our feet or how to manoeuvre a narrow gap. To drive smoothly and efficiently, we have to lose our self-consciousness and become one with the car. Writing, at its best, is like that too. If we focus too hard on what we want to say and how we want to say it, the page or the screen may remain stubbornly blank, or words may appear but refuse to come alive or convey what we want them to. Only when we stop trying and become absorbed in the work – when we lose ourselves in the writing – does the process begin in earnest.",

Silence and power work hand in hand. In documentary records what appears on the agenda or in the variables chosen for analysis often represents only the acceptable, anodyne face of that issue. Silences at all levels, individual and collective, relate to issues and aspects deemed unacceptable, unattractive and/or dangerous to those who impose the silence for whatever reasons.

Some adolescents are sent to the Brent Adolescent Centre by doctors; others bring themselves. Some have made a suicide attempt; others have not, but may have it in mind for the future, even though they may never refer to it. A suicidal act can, and often does, end a life. The adolescent's guilt and concern for the suffering his suicide will cause to his parents often seems totally lacking. If someone is determined to kill himself, nobody will be unable to prevent it; the secrecy of a suicidal plan increases its potency as a weapon to be used against our help. Suicide is always a sign of serious pathology; the suicidal act takes place during a transitory psychotic episode. Whether or not the outcome is physically serious, suicide is an attack on the person's own body.",

      "abstract": "I have been an ileostomate since August, 1976. My ostomy was performed after years of dealing with Crohn's disease. I had been well prepared for the surgery and felt a huge sense of relief when it was finally completed. I regard my stoma and my body with awe and respect. The birth of my stoma hailed a rebirth of health. As with other disabilities affecting bodily appearance or function, one might assume that sexual performance becomes inhibited. This, in fact, was not the case. I chose instead to affirm my sexuality. This required emotional as well as physical readjustment. The return home after surgery dramatically sets the tone for subsequent sexual adjustment. If you are returning to a pre, vious relationship; you may at times feel unsupported and lonely in your new body state. The following are some suggestions gleaned from my own postsurgery adjustment. 1. Regard your homecoming as an opportunity to reacquaint yourself with your partner. Approach each other with the sensitivity and newness of early romance. 2. Emotional intimacy and closeness are far more important than sexual performance. Allow yourself plenty of time to ease into sexual relations again. Meanwhile, cultivate the courting stages-candlelight dinners, cuddling, and the like. 3. Resume sleeping in the same bed as your partner, if that was your previous custom. Return to other old habits as well, as long as they feel good. You are not an alien being. 4. Use a plastic sheet if you are concerned about leakage-it can easily be thrown",

Due to the fact that children are not yet fully developed cognitively, cannot understand on their own the concept of death. At that age, death seems for them not to be permanent. Children believe that death is a reversible process that the person in their family is temporarily left and they will return at any moment, and they will wait and ask for that moment long after the actual death, if lacked of any other information. Moreover, children think that death is avoidable, since - at that age, self-centeredness is somehow a characteristic of their personality and death hasn't affected their own person; therefore, when death occurs in their family, their reality will be brutally shaken and they will be very disoriented. Also, in early childhood, kids have a symbolic, magical perspective about death; they imagine it as a devil, a monster or a black lady with a scythe and many other images, far from a realistic perspective. Considering this aspects, it is very important that a realistic, honest, adapted to their age perspective of death when it affects their family. Unfortunately, in many cultures, death is still a taboo. It still exists the belief of overprotecting children from suffering by hiding the death of a close family member, lying them and taking them far away so that they cannot see the dead person. But actually, by practicing this, parents, teachers and persons around the children only make him be more disoriented and suffer more by not knowing what happened with the person they love. As a parent or teacher, it is very important to understand that staying beside the children and sustaining him emotionally, without hiding him any aspect about death of the loved one has a crucial importance for their future development; otherwise, it is probable that they will develop symptoms of chronic depression, and as adults, problems of attachment and extreme fear of death. Proper education for population regarding this delicate subject is a sign of a developed society. In the light of this perspectives, specialists and psychotherapists should be prepared to offer advice and support in any moment so that parents will be learn how to stand by their children in the hard and long process of managing their negative emotions, living their mourning together.",

      "abstract": "Rumors are defined as 'non-verified assertions on an event that circulate orally and that in the course of their circulation change in contents and forms' or as 'allegedly true information that are spread orally, and whose authenticity cannot be directly verified'. They can appear at all times and in all kinds of society. Each spreading of information, however, does not mean that rumors are being spread. The spreading of rumors consists only in a transmission of changed news and information based on non-verified data given by a large number of persons. The use or misuse of rumors are immanent in human curiosity, in the need of man for information, and in the inclination of people to interpret, consciously or subconsciously, news and information they get in 'their own way' (after their own views, motives and interests) and to convey them in that form to their acquaintances, relatives, friends, colleagues, and the like. On the basis of the analysis of more than 4,000 rumors, which has been made after the war in the USA, they are classified to five groups: 1) rumors of hatred, 2) rumors of fear and uneasiness, 3) rumors of escapism, 4) rumors on supernatural miracles, and 5) rumors of curiosity. The right recipe for suppressing the rumors is hard to find, but offering as many as possible public and to everyone accessible information on all problems and issues for which there exists manifest and massive interest should certainly be useful. In this manner also the number of rumors can be reduced. However, as long as untouchable information ghettos exist, in which the circulation of information is the privilege of the minority of chosen and proven people, rumors will be shrouded by the exclusiveness of 'leaked' or 'broken' secrets, and will attract a wish of people to learn them and to inform other people 'in their own specific manner' on them.",

      "title": "Drinking from the fire hose",
      "abstract": "FigureI'm sure most of us, at one time or another, have felt overwhelmed at work. Think about those days when new information and issues are coming at you every minute, and there isn't enough time or cognitive ability to deal with all of it. Maybe that's often, and you may not be alone. Can you visualize drinking from a fire hose? It's a metaphor that seems to perfectly describe this inundated feeling. It may happen when you get a new boss, or your boss gets a new boss, or you start in a new position. Even if everything is the same, sometimes organizational crises occur, ranging from natural disasters to sentinel events. Conditions may change in your work responsibilities. Does this sound familiar? “Can you take on this additional unit(s)/department(s) temporarily while we're looking for a new leader?” Or maybe you've gone back to school and/or added family obligations while trying to maintain equilibrium at work. There are probably a thousand more scenarios both professional and personal that you can describe. So what do you do when you're overwhelmed? Often easier said than done, try to assuage the situation. Remember that you control your feelings. You can convert a barrage of data into useful information. First and foremost, what's really important? This definition can change based on context—what's important to you, your organization, and your staff isn't always well aligned. Your initial call to action may be to figure out how to prioritize these goals. Avoid using precious time and attention on what isn't valuable to you, which includes mindless chatter. And make sure what you've determined to be important is coordinated with what your boss thinks; otherwise, it may be a career-limiting gesture to sidestep the wrong things. Ask good questions to figure out the answers to what's relevant. If you can learn how to turn the deluge into what's important to you and/or within your scope of immediate responsibilities, then you may be able to eliminate a fair amount of extraneous noise. Requesting help with filtering through and organizing your thoughts is a reasonable, but often neglected, step. As is delegating and receiving support. You'll want to gather your resources before you feel like you're drowning to be ready and armed for the fire hose. Our colleagues who are passionate about mindfulness must be clamoring for attention by now. Being truly present in the moment and having self-awareness are sometimes elusive skills that clearly contribute to being at peace with whatever is thrown your way. I'm not an expert, but who can argue with using positive energy to focus on the here and now without judgment, leaving past regrets and future worries elsewhere? Be good to yourself, calm your mind, and give yourself a break. Drinking from the fire hose may conjure up silly images, but it's an uncomfortable state of mind. We are at our best when we're focused on what we believe in, what our organization wants, and what our staff members need—hopefully fully aligned. Take a gulp and then switch to a straw as soon as you can. No drowning allowed!Figure[email protected]",

Having found my retelling stuck and I could not move on as my heart was full, I came to talk with Thanh for her wisdom of how our co-composing should go forward. We then decided that I would start our retelling with moments of a year later, a healthier happier story begins to be lived and told. This section is then followed by my retelling of a year before: thinking backward and forward from our days of rooting relationships. I show how, over two years, I learned so much in being alongside Ryan and Thanh-and also, Mệ (Ryan's grandmother), including: living layers of relationality (relationality opens potential for family-ship, navigating complexity, opening portals into the child's worlds, friendship, and advocacy); being afraid of academic failure as a sign of life failure; and, \"all we care is to help our children\".",

Friends play a vital role in recovery. Therapists are restricted by availability and professional boundaries. Friends are usually available and by keeping and maintaining healthy boundaries could be extremely valuable. The significance of supportive friends is of value beyond price. Friends are so grateful when they come to understand the amazing coping mechanism. Being a part of a friendship group or team dilutes the intensity of relationships, and completely alters the dynamics of the survivor's impact. Friends and carers who share the survivor's walk out of fragmentation, confusion, and fear into the breathtaking freedom of life as a single, whole individual, learn about working together, appreciating that where one is weak another can be strong.",

      "title": "Hope from Conversation",
      "abstract": "Abstract One vital source of hope for people diagnosed with cancer is conversation with a companion caregiver. Unfortunately, some people encounter “gloom and doom” even from caregivers with good intentions. Professionals especially, and even family members, can be so wary of giving “false hope” that they may inadvertently sew doubt and anxiety. There is no such thing as false hope, only false narratives that are unlikely to be lived out in light of the facts. Hope is eternal, and realistic hope changes over time. An important source of hope is healing conversation. The elements of healing conversation are listening carefully and responding accurately, compassionately, and thoughtfully. This approach is animated by empathy, which is both a skill and a quality. Talking “about” mortal time—that is, talking about one’s own mortality—and talking ‘in” mortal time each call for conversational skill. Finding the right words, phrases, and sensitive empathic tone in these conversations is key. “Everyday conversation” about topics other than cancer is important because people are more than their diagnosis. It takes both discipline and spontaneity to find useful phrases in mortal time, such as “hold steady, we can do this,” and avoid platitudes that may offend, such as “God doesn’t give you anything you can’t handle.” Many people are unwilling to engage or unskilled in this type of conversation. Sometimes avoidance of mortality is useful and not necessarily evidence of denial but, rather, functional in that it helps the patient go about the business of daily living.",

      "abstract": "During bereavement, we often describe our loss experiences as shattering. We sense that we can never be the same persons we were prior to our losses. Self-doubt often accompanies our surprise as we wonder whether we will ever be whole again. Imagine a delicately woven web attached to its surroundings at points beyond counting. In reality, there are usually many threads of connection between us. Along those lines of connection we form bonds in patterns of give-and-take with each other. Give-and-take along the lines is not always positive, and some connections are negative. The web metaphor suggests that grief work and relearning of the world require more or less total reweaving of ourselves. As we cope, we engage with and move beyond suffering. To reestablish wholeness in our lives, we must move beyond the paralysis of such suffering. We struggle to put our lives back together.",

      "title": "On Questions",
      "abstract": "In the course of his life a man surrounds himself with questions, much as he surrounds himself with furniture, books or pictures. Personality is expressed not only by the selection of a Chippendale chair, the amassing of early colour-plate books, or the purchase of a Renoir, but also by the kind of questions which a man “collects”-raises, without necessarily solving. Some questions, like some books, are to be brooded over and studied; some are introduced only to be contemplated from time to time, like fine bindings; and some occur so casually as hardly to rouse any attention at all. There is an obvious difference between a man who bids carefully at a book auction or forces himself on to his knees to identify a dust-covered quarto in a slum bookshop, and a man whose library is inherited from parents or grandparents; acceptances and not choices will distinguish the casual possessor from the bookman. Similarly, there are many questions which sit lightly on a man's mind, which are as little the object of sustained wondering or bafflement as his ancestors” well bound volumes of theology or game-shooting are the reflection of his own tastes or interests. These may be questions of any sort: they may be factual questions, important or trivial, or they may be theoretical questions, philosophical perhaps, or religious or scientific. A student of literature, for instance, has been known to congratulate himself on his ignorance of modern science, ignorance so deliberate that any scientific question raised in his presence fails even to make him wonder. For any person, however, there are ranges of questions which barely touch his mind: he may be aware that he does not know how to derive answers to them for himself, but his inability will not cause him concern. The memory, the practical or the reasoning skill of the kind that would be required are perhaps so much out of proportion to what he possesses that to bemoan the lack of them is unrealistic -as it is often idle and merely conventional for one who is tone-deaf to say how much he wishes he could sing an aria . Other questions altogether, important or trivial, he takes seriously and troubles to answer, because they touch his own special interests directly: he may pride himself on never neglecting a newspaper problem in bridge or chess, or he may never fail to answer correctly a question about the construction of some instrument or machine. The same person, however, will also get the length of raising many questions which remain mere questions. He may be troubled and puzzled about certain political or social question which circumstances do not compel him to answer: but he will not be hypocritical in professing an interest in them. Some of these questions, of course, may become solved after a fashion, if he listens to the voice of politician, statistician, priest or psychologist and is lucky enough to get an answer which satisfies him. But many will survive with just enough recurrences of wondering about them to make them, as you might say, chronic. This is the intermediate class of questions.",

      "title": "Living with thalassemia",
      "abstract": "Living with a chronic illness has had an extensive impact on my life. Thalassemia has shaped how I live and perceive my life and it is a driving force in shaping my personality. Thalassemia and the physical challenges that accompany this disease have created my intense passion for living and a deep appreciation for health. Each day is a gift to be cherished.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not remember being diagnosed at 14 months of age, I remember being sick often as a child. Doctors' appointments, medical procedures, and surgeries are a routine part of life. Thalassemia is a high maintenance disease and, like many chronic illnesses, survival is often a fight. Therefore, I have a heightened awareness of my own mortality. I do not fixate on death, but I definitely do not plan far ahead into the future. This is not to say that I do not have a plethora of hopes and dreams.\r\n\r\nThalassemia has made me determined and has given me a strong will. Having a chronic illness has also taught me to be empathetic. I love people and my friends and family are my greatest treasures. My ultimate goal is to be the best person that I can be. I do not know how long I will be on this earth, but my desire is to make a difference in people's lives. Quality of life is more meaningful to me than quantity.\r\n\r\nI always strive to live positively with thalassemia, but at times it is frustrating having to deal with a chronic illness that consumes an exorbitant amount of time with transfusions, a nightly desferal regimen, constant doctor's appointments, and various other procedures. If I could choose, I would not erase thalassemia from my life, rather I would change the way illness is managed in our society. The uphill battle for me is not always the medical dimension of the disease, but the bureaucracy that defines the health care system. Insurance is stressful for countless patients. On several occasions, I almost lost my medical insurance and more than once I have been denied coverage due to my pre-existing condition. It was medical insurance, not ill health, that almost prevented me from attending graduate school because my HMO would not offer out-of-state coverage. Unfortunately, insurance companies, not doctors, dictate what procedures can be performed, the length of my stay in the hospital, and what medications can be used. Insurance coverage has also been a financial burden. When I worked as a pre-school teacher for 6 months, my insurance payments and medical bills exceeded my income.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult aspects of living with thalassemia is coping with the burden it places on my family and friends. My family is extremely supportive and I believe that my thalassemia has strengthened our family dynamic, but that does not eliminate their worry and stress. Chronic illness can adversely affect the marital relationship as well as the siblings involved. There is a dire need for support services to help manage the stress placed on a family as a result of chronic illness.\r\n\r\nWith improved technology and medical advances, people with thalassemia are living longer. Therefore, consideration must be given to the new issues, such as fertility and employment, that arise from an extended lifespan. Support services and outreach programs are critical in helping patients cope with these challenges, but programs such as these are often difficult to access. With budget cuts and rising costs in health care, programs either do not exist or must be eliminated.\r\n\r\nI hope that in the future more funds will go toward improving the management and treatment of thalassemia. A routine liver biopsy is invasive and painful. A machine has been developed, a ferrirometer, that examines liver iron stores painlessly and noninvasively. Clearly, such a machine would dramatically improve patient's quality of life, yet only two ferritometers exist in the world. My hospital would like to acquire the third, but funding is a major challenge.\r\n\r\nIf I could advise clinicians, I would encourage them to make every effort to humanize health care. I respect my doctors and I place much trust in them. Doctors are inundated with a large volume of patients, research, and education, thus making it easy to lose sight of the meaning of medicine—healing. Healing goes beyond prescriptions and procedures. Healing is listening, caring, answering questions, being honest, and treating the patient as a human being. Collaboration among disciplines is especially important with thalassemia because the disease affects so many physiologic systems. The patient and family must be seen as an integral part of the team and children must be encouraged to be proactive in their own care.\r\n\r\nI must emphasize the importance of specialized thalassemia centers and centers of excellence for specific diseases in general. Thalassemia centers across the United States are few and extremely difficult to access. Health care is decentralized, due to lack of funding, which is also problematic. Many doctors are not informed about thalassemia and the complexities of the disease. Consequently it is often up to patients to educate them. As the survival rate of patients increases, a benefit of specialized care, it is imperative that we strive for standardized and centralized thalassemia care. A multidisciplinary team approach of experts, working together, can greatly improve the quality of a patient's life.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges I face, I would not change the fact that I have thalassemia, I would only change the bureaucracy that underlies disease in general. I have come in contact with many amazing individuals with thalassemia who have become some of my closest friends. It is difficult to witness others fighting the same battle and it is devastating to lose loved ones to this disease. I will never get over the death of my friends, rather I have integrated the grief into my life. I carry a torch in my heart for them as I try to seize each day and live life to the fullest.",

In this regard it is timely to explore whether it is a folly that I can only experience the beauty of life when I live in comfort with myself and with those whom I choose to live with. Alternatively, if we embody relationship in our meetings with others, we will always experience discomfort as responsibility, accountability and justice are central within relationships. In this regard, we are interconnected and interdependent to one another and therefore we need to be hospitable to one another. As liturgy is relational in its being it should be a service to justice. In this regard we will experience the beauty of a life of folly.",

      "title": "'Why Don't I Just Create my Main To be a Space That I Could Always Feel That Comfortable?': Negotiating Achievement Imperatives Through Instagram.",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Young people appear to be under extreme pressure to live up to complicated, unrealistic expectations to ‘achieve’ across the domains of their lives. These expectations include achieving academically, gaining employment, volunteering their time, participating in their culture and community, as well as carefully maintaining the self physically and mentally. The pursuit of all these goals together may be a stressful, failure-prone task that can encourage feelings of distress, anxiety, depression, and, in extreme cases suicidality, amongst young people. Instagram is a key pedagogic tool for young people to understand who and how they should be in the world. Importantly, this platform may reflect and reinforce expectations of achievement by, and to, young people. Prefects are considered role models for their peers and as such may be under exacerbated pressure to meet these achievement demands. As such, their experiences may be particularly valuable to understand achievement imperatives. Expectations are gendered; achieving as a young woman, or successful femininity, is defined separately to standards of achievement for young men. As such, this thesis explores how young women negotiate complex and competing gendered achievement expectations through Instagram. Nine young women were recruited from a local, single-sex secondary school in Pōneke, Aotearoa to participate in a three-stage study. The first stage included an initial focus group exploring expectations these young women negotiated in their day-to-day lives. Following this, the participants were followed on Instagram for a period of six weeks during which time the interviewer engaged them in discussion around their posted Instagram content. A final focus group was conducted to explore these young women’s management of Instagram norms. Social constructionist thematic analysis was used to analyse focus group transcripts, online discussions, and Instagram content. Through Instagram, the participants negotiated three key achievement imperatives with their followers: control, authenticity and intimacy. These imperatives are explored through circumstances in which the participants achieve or struggle to achieve these in ways they prefer. At times the platform presented the achievement of these imperatives as a possibility, at other times the platform limited the participants’ capacity to manage these imperatives. The implications for the participants as they negotiate themselves and their lives through Instagram are discussed. This research has implications for the way that Instagram is understood, in research and in the public sphere, to impact young people’s health and wellbeing. Young people are critical, capable users of the Instagram platform, that aim to manage complex achievement imperatives within a constantly evolving social world.&lt;/p&gt;",

When a person loses his job, loses his assets, we see that it’s possible to identify the different factors that drive both ability to cope and, in contrast anxiety. Whereas losing one’s job and one’s assets both provoke equal frequency of anxiety. Losing one’s house provokes the highest level of anxiety. In all cases thinking about the government and external forms of support, such as insurance, does not ameliorate anxiety. But there are things that do reduce anxiety. Belief in a personal God is a strong anxiety reducer for both situations, and is also important for other anxiety provoking situations. Some anxiety reducers are recognition of one’s friends and family, and the realization that other people are ‘in the same boat’, and one is not really alone.",

Frequent examples include: Why did this occur? I am a good person and have led a good life. Why did this happen to me? Did I do something to cause this to happen? Why did God allow this to happen? Will the perpetrators of evil be punished? I have lost so much; is life worth living anymore? What do I have to live for?

      "abstract": "Suffering is the experience of distress or disharmony caused by the loss, or threatened loss, of what we most cherish. Such losses may strip away the beliefs by which we construct a meaningful narrative of human life in general and our own in particular. The vocation of physicians and other health professionals is to relieve suffering caused by illness, trauma, and bodily degeneration. However, since suffering is an existential state that does not necessarily parallel physical or emotional states, physicians cannot rely solely on knowledge and skills that address physiological dysfunction. Rather, they must learn to engage the patient at an existential level. Unfortunately, however, medical pedagogy encourages \"detached concern,\" which devalues subjectivity, emotion, relationship, and solidarity. The term \"compassionate solidarity\" summarizes an alternative model, which begins with empathic listening and responding, requires reflectivity and self-understanding, and is in itself a healing act. Poetry, along with other imaginative writing, may help physicians and other health professionals grow in self-awareness and gain deeper understanding of suffering, empathy, compassion, and symbolic healing.",

In addition, authenticity connects with other values that can be in tension with happiness.

      "title": "Notes on the Existential and Interactional Dimensions of Authenticity: A Symbolic Interactionist Study of Breast Cancer Internet Forums",
      "abstract": "Existential AuthenticityI still remember looking at people and hating them because they were going to get to live to be old and I wasn’t.Nobody here is stronger than you are [...] you can take charge […] if you cry all the time and live in fear […] it won’t make cancer go away.[Interaction on an Internet breast cancer forum]According to existential philosophy, death is an irrefutable aspect of life. Human existence is fundamentally being-toward-death (Sein-zum-Tode) inasmuch as it involves taking on the possibilities of self—a set of future projected personal choices and their corresponding consequences—and growing into them (Heidegger 232-233). Death is not to be seen as something that marks the end of life, but rather as something that is always already an inevitable part of it (227). One never exists without the other. Heidegger maintained that self-authenticity comprises an understanding and acceptance of the possibility that one always faces death. To live authentically, one must make choices within her or his own life, despite death’s looming. Ignoring or denying the facticity of death, or failing to maximise the possibilities of one’s life, is to live inauthentically (240-243).The first post in the epigraph above, taken from a discussion thread in an Internet forum on breast cancer, exemplifies, in the Heideggerian sense, an expression of inauthenticity. The individual had seemingly given up on the possibility of life and allowed a single possibility—death—to (at least temporarily) dictate her outlook on life. She rejected the new potentials that living with cancer presented. By giving away the possibility of choice for life, she gave up her true self. Nothingness replaced being (Sartre, Being), stripping away the authenticity of being for-itself, which is rooted in “spontaneous original choice that depends on the individual's freedom” (Onof).Such an analysis represents an historically dominant ontology of authenticity within philosophy. It has been closely followed by psychological theories of self, which posit that human beings have within them an essential, authentic self that confronts the external world. Heidegger, Sartre, and other existentialists drew on an even earlier, Romantic conception of authenticity going back at least as far as Rousseau, which contented that “individuals should follow their inner voices and resist the pressures and callings of society in order to recover intimate moral contact with themselves” (Lewin and Williams 65). Intimate moral contact with oneself is, however, lost within the auspices of contemporary societies (Gubrium and Holstein), where people are more concerned with appearing sincere (true to others) than authentic (true to themselves) (Trilling). From this perspective, people implicitly believe that an authentic self exists within them, yet it may remain largely out of reach. Inauthenticity may be the result of refusing to live authentically—for example, ignoring or rejecting choices that could lead to fulfillment—or the result of social and cultural structures that prevent individuals from expressing themselves authentically (Hochschild).Note, however, that the opening forum post is written in past tense. The person who wrote it later came to see herself as living authentically, despite, or more appropriately, because of the discourses of death that surround her condition. The second post, a response to the first, offered both encouragement and the vision of a self that was not defeated by cancer. Together, they articulate a socially constructed, interactionist ontology of the authentic cancer survivor: a person who is strong, who “can take charge,” that is, who can make spontaneous choices despite the chance of dying. This type of authentic self is not “really real” (Geertz); it is interactionally created and maintained. As we argue in this paper, authenticity is not an essential aspect of being, but is rather the product of a reflexive process of dialogue, both internally between the “I” and the “me” (Mead), and interpersonally among multiple people who come to agree upon what constitutes authenticity in a particular milieu (Vannini and Williams).In what follows, we explore the intermingling of two dimensions of authenticity: the existential dimension, which has to do with cancer patients’ being-toward-death andbeing-in-situation; and the interactional dimension, in which individuals simultaneously narrate cancer experiences and collaboratively construct the ideal meaning of an authentic cancer patient. We argue that the interactionist dimension is particularly important to understand because it facilitates the existential dimension. Whereas existentialism theorises people as naturally free and responsible agents who determine the course of their own lives, symbolic interactionism theorises the social foundation upon which people build pragmatic notions such as freedom and self-determination. For interactionists, a person’s sense of self (past, present, or future) does not naturally occur. Rather, “mind is a thoroughly social affair, a product of social experience” (Carreira da Silva 45). As human beings develop, they learn to take themselves as objects through their ongoing interactions with(in) the world, learning to interact with themselves and to define themselves in terms that often cohere with others’ definitions of them (Cooley). As we suggest in this paper, the authentic, existential self is thus not an inherent aspect of a person that is threatened by cancer to be saved or recovered. Rather, people dealing with cancer get together, online and elsewhere, and collaboratively construct what is for them an authentic image of the cancer survivor. This socially authentic image becomes the ideal upon which individuals modify their self-conceptions.Research Site and MethodsWe apply our understanding of the relation between the existential and interactional dimensions of authenticity to data we collected from an Internet forum populated by patients and survivors of breast cancer. A non-profit organisation initiated the forum around 2002 to supply general and technical information about breast cancer, with the declared goal of assisting women and their loved ones in gaining insight into the illness, its causes, and effects. As of early 2015, it was an established and reputable Internet forum that had more than 150,000 registered members who had engaged in upwards of 120,000 unique discussion topics spread across dozens of sub-forums. Forum participants could interact by reading messages, posting their own messages, and replying to others’ posts. The forum was public as it did not require registration for people to view messages, but registration was required to post messages. Members chose usernames, which could be their real or pseudonymous. The forum was segmented into 19 categories, with a total of 78 sub-forums. There were sub-forums with technical information regarding diagnosis, treatment, testing, prognosis, and specific graduations or types of breast cancer, as well as non-technical sub-forums that dealt with everyday means of recovery and/or coping with cancer, advocacies, and social networking. All the sub-forums allowed and encouraged participants to share their personal knowledge and experiences. Our analysis follows the contours of interpretive interactionism, interactional narrative analysis, and ethnographic content analysis. Interpretive interactionism “signifies an attempt to join the traditional symbolic interactionist approach with the interpretive, phenomenological works of Heidegger […and] to make the world of lived experience directly accessible to the reader” (Denzin 14). As such, we have sought to clearly represent individuals’ reported experiences with cancer and how they relate to struggles for existential authenticity. Interactional narrative analysis highlights the co-constructed nature of the contexts, which “shape possibilities in […] women’s lives, their experiences of illness, and the specific illness narratives the women produce collaboratively” (Riessman 4; Bell). By focusing on the interactional qualities of the narratives produced by forum members, we seek to highlight how authenticity is collaboratively constructed. Lastly, ethnographic content analysis stresses the significant amount of time and effort that researchers put into the study of mediated texts. We did not discover the posts through “big data” techniques such as scraping (Kumar), nor did we cull them after conveniently scanning forum threads. Instead, we thoughtfully chose posts that represent the larger patterns of interaction that the second author identified over months of regular engagement in the forums.In this paper, we report on some characteristics of authenticity discourses. We have avoided providing pseudonyms or otherwise identifying individual posters because our analytic focus is on discourse and narrative, rather than on individuals (Bassett and O’Riordan). Nevertheless, throughout the research project (which is ongoing), we have carefully considered the ethics of Internet-based research involving experiences of a life-changing illness such as cancer. Following the ethical guidelines set forth by the Association of Internet Researchers (Markham and Buchanan), we focused on how our study, despite emphasising discourse, deals with people’s lived experiences. We support the ethical ideal that researchers studying vulnerable populations are obligated to protect those populations however possible (King; Rodham and Gavin). However, we found the forum to be full of discourse through which participants actively resisted labels such as “victim” and instead framed their online activities as important steps in maintaining or recovering an authentic sense of self, as well as being able to help others. Because the forum allows users to reveal as much or little about themselves as they choose, because the forum is open to the public for browsing, and because we do not impinge upon participants’ actions through our analysis of their interactions, we believe the benefits of the study—an improved understanding of how people collaboratively construct feelings of self-authenticity—outweigh any problems we have been able to imagine. Our ethics and methods are in line with other recent publications that use similar data (Love et al.; Sillence)Cancer and Existential CrisisThe Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word “crisis.” One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger—but recognize the opportunity.[John F. Kennedy]Cancer abruptly presents a person with a heightened sense of mortality. Knowledge of cancer represents a moment in which one faces the annihilation of the possibilities of being. “Cancer is a shocking thing … we don’t face death very often, so it’s overwhelming” [forum post]. It may lead to despair, aimlessness, and the loss of meaning, or to a realisation of the urgency to live life to the fullest. We borrow Denzin’s concept of an epiphany to theorise moments of existential crisis, such as when someone learns she has breast cancer. “In [epiphanies], personal character is manifested and made apparent” (Denzin 15). He postulates how a single epiphanic moment can “shatter a person's life and make it never the same again” (17). Sociologically, epiphanies occur in problematic situations that must be interpreted. They have multiple, variable meanings to the individual and others that may change with time, and they can turn lives around. Methodologically, epiphanies are both subjectively experienced but intersubjectively communicated and thus we can study them using interpretive methods.From an existentialist perspective, authenticity finds a tipping point in moments where contingencies or crises dominate. Individuals who acknowledge their being-in-situation and then confront it in the best possible way are authentic; those who do not are inauthentic.To be authentic is to realise one’s being-in-situation, no matter what this situation may happen to be: through a profound awareness, through the authentic realisation of one’s being-in-situation, one brings into existence the situation on one hand, and human existence on the other. (Sartre, War Diaries 54)Sartre’s being-in-situation relates directly to people’s experiences with cancer. A diagnosis can lead to existential crisis by suddenly increasing the salience of mortality, heightening awareness of one’s being-toward-death and thereby leading them to confront their being-in-situation. Many forms of interaction with self and other articulate this being-in-situation. We assume that most of these interactions are private, taking place behind closed doors with loved ones or with internally with oneself. However, the Internet has facilitated individuals’ ability to connect cancer as a personal trouble with cancer as a public issue (Høybye, Johansen, and Tjørnhøj-Thomsen; Klemm, Reppert, and Visich).EpiphaniesIn order to understand how forum participants understood existential authenticity for themselves, we first sought out discussions about the early moments after diagnosis. Many threads contained posts that illustrated how cancer diagnoses led to epiphanies. We found that, despite a common conception of epiphanies as sudden and immediate, they were not necessarily brief, as experiences of crisis occurred over time and had to be interpreted, both by the individual experiencing the crisis and by others. Notably, other forum members were crucial in helping provide interpretive frames for diagnosis.Shortly after I finished my tx [treatment] and was still very traumatized by it all, I met a woman […] who […] taught me something very profound, which is that when we experience something very traumatic, we have to figure out a way to use it for good, or we will continue to become a victim.” I think that’s a very powerful concept, and one of the reasons I continue to post [...] because helping newly-dx’ed [diagnosed] women helps me, too.The knowledge of cancer triggered powerful emotions in the form of spontaneous confusion and disenchantment, upheaving the continuity and planned direction of women’s lives. Many women translated the strong emotions they experienced alongside the support they received from others into an impetus to grow beyond the contingent misfortunes of cancer. In another thread, a member described that emotional spillovers and intense self-denial initially hindered her movement towards growth, but later she came to see such despair as unproductive and had to confront and overcome the being-in-situation (in other words, the crisis) of cancer.I went through a lot of the emotional changes you ladies are describing back then. The crying in the bathroom, the bargaining with god. Ultimately I think it made me focus on what was important and what absolutely was not […] I sought out new experiences, and I discarded emotional baggage that was just weighing me down […] I think the lessons learned back then have helped me face this challenge with more aplomb and a more optimistic outlook […. Cancer] can actually be a blessing in disguise.Another member agreed with this idea of cancer as a blessing:It can be a blessing if it is a catalyst to moving us to a better place emotionally, spiritually and even physically meaning we begin to take better care of ourselves and our health in every way. It isn’t easy but the changes are well worth it.From an existential perspective, rooted in a realist epistemology, narratives can be taken as reports about what “really happened.” As such, these co-constructed narratives articulate an epiphany-driven growth model of cancer-coping, where the illness stimulates a focus on one’sbeing-toward-death, necessitating a choice to live meaningfully or to reject such a choice. Similarly, among the many forum threads we observed, most contained narratives of adaptation and of wisdom gained from confronting and overcoming one’s being-in-situation. Discourses of confidence, optimism, and emotional resilience filled the forums.From a social constructionist perspective, however, we do not take these narratives to be reports of what necessarily “really” happened, but rather as moments through which reality itself is constructed. It is impossible to know whether the epiphanies described actually occurred as women described them, or whether they emerged, as Denzin has argued, over time through interaction and interpretation. Keeping this latter perspective in mind, we look again at forum data to see how members constructed a sense of self-authenticity, paying particular attention to the collaborative milieu in which individuals shared personal narratives (Bell).Collaboratively Constructing the Authenticity of Being-toward-DeathIn Time and Being, Heidegger writes, “higher than actuality stands possibility” (34), which we take here to emphasise Heidegger’s belief that authentic selves are rooted in the directions taken in response to crisis. If a cancer diagnosis is an “actuality,” then one ought to embrace the possibilities that extend from it. To allow the actuality of cancer to supersede other possibilities in life is to live (or die) inauthentically. We saw this existential phenomenon of being-toward-death in interactions throughout the forum. Many members mutually shared the notion that cancer raised awareness of mortality. Long-term members, called “veterans” in the forums, overwhelming agreed that the “right” way to handle this was to make a choice between meaningful or meaningless living.Cancer is a shocking thing […] we don’t face death very often, so it’s overwhelming […] but I’ve tried to liken it to how we all know the stats of getting in a car wreck, and yet we get in a car without our kids in a row and drive away, for we CHOOSE to live.In this and other examples, veterans used analogies and examples about how they “choose to live.” The use of analogy or example helped veterans and newer members alike connect the breadth of possibilities to mundane activities, which they defined as authentic. When a newer member complained, “my feelings are not just bubbling to the surface, they are streaming out of me. I can barely control telling others how it is and how I feel,” a veteran responded that physical exercise, being outdoors, and being in-the-present helped in coping with emotional turmoil. Such examples served as strategies through which those in crisis could “go from sick to well.” Another participant wrote that heeding veterans’ advice would help newer members “move even further along the path of a fulfilling life.”Contrary to what may seem from our examples so far to be an uplifting environment in which everyone succeeded at embracing the possibilities of life with cancer, some patients occasionally expressed their frustration with the personal troubles that emerged from their condition and associated life choices.Now, my life is turned upside-down, and I am filled with anxiety. This is all my own doing, since I decided that I needed to be true to myself. That was the one major thing that I had denied myself my entire life […] I think that I was the fool.This is an important example for two reasons. First, it represents, in existential terms, being-in-situation. For most people, life involves feelings of having been thrown into a world “not of our own making, already disposed by moods and particular commitments, with a past behind us that constrains our choices” (Varga and Guignon). The epiphanies that came with or after cancer diagnoses grossly exaggerated such feelings, as hundreds of individual forum posts demonstrated. The repetition of such personal narratives is significant, as we find epiphanies “in those interactional situations where personal troubles become public issues” (Denzin 18). The forum was one such interactional situation, comprising thousands of moments in which people openly admitted their being-in-situation and either sought or offered consolation or advice, or both. For Heidegger, admitting to being-in-situation is key to authenticity—if one hides from the facticity of her situation, there is no opportunity to choose a future (Heidegger 242-3).The second reason this is an important example is because it represents the interactional basis through which groups socially define and negotiate definitions of existential authenticity. The post stands as an interactional moment in which a participant called into question many veterans’ normative conceptions of embracing being-toward-death as necessary for an improvement in one’s quality of life. Having attested to how cancer had compelled her to make a choice between living authentically and inauthentically (a choice she had, until then, denied herself), this member then claimed that choosing authenticity had brought on additional turmoil and anxiety. Veterans and other members quickly rallied to redefine her choices as nonetheless necessary and right. Some highlighted the positive outcomes of making tough choices and downplayed the negative. In one response, a community member suggested that contracting breast cancer placed women in a position of exigency that compelled them to question life’s limitations.According to many veterans, the awareness of being-toward-death, while disruptive, offered at least as much good as it did bad. Participants collectively maintained a discourse in which individuals should worry less about things like “money” and to “absorb each moment as if it is a gift, because that is what this life is—a gift.” Other posters also highlighted how they dealt with being-toward-death and the self-authenticating decisions that came from it:Nothing like mortality in your face to make you realize that you want something different or more. I [...] have decided to make a major career change after all of this […] that makes me happy and makes a difference in the world.Life is a lot more vivid now. I notice the little things and am much grateful for them […] I am […] relaunching my career and writing a journal article with two colleagues.These and other posts discursively functioned to define the “proper” way to deal with being-toward-death by implicitly associating authenticity with the choices that individuals make and their consequences for self. In doing so, they collectively (re)construct the authenticity of a cancerous self, which “is at once a meaning from the past [acknowledged during the epiphany] and promise into a future [embracing being-toward-death] around a processual present [interacting with others as a method of working through being-in-situation]” (Weigert 37). Further, because self and social action dialectically shape one another, supporting one’s feeling of self-authenticity can motivate the individual towards “appropriate” future social actions, which will feed back into future self-authentications. Authenticity is thus not only a phenomenological and existential experience; it is a distinctly social and interactional process.ConclusionIn this paper we have attempted to articulate two ontological dimensions of authenticity—the existential and the interactional. Like other scholarly discussions of authenticity (for example, Taylor; Theodossopoulos; Vannini and Williams), we have argued that authenticity is not so much a subjective concept as it is a social, pragmatic concept that speaks to subjectivity.Beginning with Heidegger and Sartre, we investigated how members of an online cancer forum intersubjectively communicated ideas of being-toward-death and being-in-situation. Individuals experienced being-toward-death as crisis, which then required that they confront their being-in-situation and acknowledge the possibilities for life in the face of its finitude. Similar studies on cancer have considered the quest for authenticity in terms of development stage models (for example, Gullickson; Krumwiede and Krumwiede; Samson and Zerter; Westman, Bergenman and Andersson). Our findings are similar to the extent that we identified a re-orientation toward the meaning of life via epiphany, with resulting personal transformations through the re-ordering of values and social relationships, which patients themselves framed as authentic.However, we have sought to clarify an interactionist conceptualisation in which self-authenticity is facilitated by a community of people who come to share meanings about life and death. Shared meanings have to do not only with objects or events in people’s lives, but with the meaning of selves. Selves are always in the process of becoming; they are neither static nor fixed things (Mead). As such, authenticity itself is something that is situationally negotiated rather than finalized; one may move back and forth between more or less authentic self-feelings as one performs the self in various milieu (Goffman; Gubrium and Holstein, Williams). We argue against the notion that existential authenticity is a purely psychological process and instead highlight how interpersonal communication facilitates perceptual shifts across the domains of being-toward-death and being-in-situation.Our study supports other studies of cancer forum interactions (for example, Chiu and Hsieh; Love et al.; Pinheiro et al.; Shim, Cappella, and Han), which have found that cycles of mutual interactions facilitate reciprocal understandings through shared narratives of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and provide structure, if not certainty, to cancer experiences. Forums serve as “communication interlocks” within which people from vastly different backgrounds become members of a meaningful subcultural community (Williams and Copes). Members rely on each other for a shared definition of the situation that legitimates their personal troubles and how they cope with them (Høybye et al.; Sillence). As patients gain knowledge from others on the forum, they in turn reproduce their newfound confidence and contribute to helping others. In the forum we studied, this macrocosm of constant interaction has become a self-sustaining and reflexive community that guides struggling patients and once-struggling survivors towards meaningful feelings of self-authenticity.ReferencesBassett, Elizabeth H., and Kate O’Riordan. “Ethics of Internet Research: Contesting the Human Subjects Research Model.” Ethics and Information Technology 4.3 (2002): 233–47.Bell, Susan E. “Narratives and lives: Women's Health Politics and the Diagnosis of Cancer for DES Daughters.” Narrative Inquiry 9.2 (1999): 1–43.Carreira da Silva, Filipe.

      "abstract": "Loss is a fundamental part of the human experience, from the loss of security and innocence that comes with the necessary separation of child from parent to the ultimate loss of life. Along the way, there are the losses of jobs, of incomes, of homes; the losses of friendships, of family members, of lovers; the losses of direction, of control, of hope. As cognitive and caring beings, humans struggle to cope with these losses, to greater and lesser degrees of success. This is the theme at the heart of this thesis. Fire Ants is composed of ten short stories, fictive works, which differ in specific subject matter, yet deal unilaterally with issues of loss. Like the venomous creatures that threaten to eat B. D. Packard alive in the title story, life eats away at a number of characters in the collection who are deficient. The narrators in \"Aftermath\" and \"Hues,\" for example, suffer psychological -- if not physical -- deaths. But not all of the characters lack coping mechanisms, unhealthy as they may sometimes be. As the stories unfold, some characters begin to gain small degrees of perspective and understanding, to learn that while life is full of loss, it is not always entirely bleak. As demonstrated in \"Cross Creek,\" good exists, though it is not always where one might expect it. And life can be full despite loss, as depicted in \"Stitches.\"",

Richard Townsend has never been one to dodge candour; his discussion here returns repeatedly to the difficulties a modern professor has in matching the expectations of the role, public and private, in his field. His self-assigned task is to find lessons from his experience, and models among his colleagues, so that he may surmount those difficulties and come closer to the ideal. Along the way, some unexpected lights are cast on the seemingly intractable problems occasioned by the closing down of schools, in a manner suggesting a provocative postscript to the articles in this issue.\n\n\t RESUME\n\n\t Il est plutot rare aujourd'hui de rencontrer un professionnel qui, devant les banalites, les deceptions et les distractions de la vie quotidienne, ose demeurer sincere face aux tracas que lui cause sa conscience.

      "abstract": "We look in order to see, but also to think, touch, feel, experience and desire. In puberty, the gaze is filled with emotions that can overwhelm the adolescent. He does not control the effect that his image has on the person who is looking at him. His body, which is changing, is alienated by the gaze of the other; he doubts his image and his narcissism is sorely tested. It is a period of narcissistic reorganisation, which is an issue of major importance in adolescence for underpinning a psychic and bodily unity that is threatened and disturbed. If he feels threatened by the gaze of the other which undermines his narcissistic integrity, the adolescent may react violently. Adolescent revolt is often an attempt at restoring a flayed narcissism. The adolescent must make a choice between remaining in the omnipotent narcissistic ideal and finding his way towards subjectivation. Meeting a psychoanalyst can be an opportunity for him to direct his gaze towards his inner world and to become the author of his own history.",

In our normal ups and downs, we have our share of exhaustion, despondency, and outrage--matched with their corresponding positive moods. But burnout and workaholism are different. They are chronic, dysfunctional, self-reinforcing, life-shortening habits. Dentists, nurses, teachers, ministers, social workers, and entertainers are especially susceptible to burnout; not because they are hard-working professionals (they tend to be), but because they are caring perfectionists who share control for the success of what they do with others and perform under the scrutiny of their colleagues (they tend to). Workaholics are also trapped in self-sealing cycles, but the elements are ever-receding visions of control and using constant activity as a barrier against facing reality. This essay explores the symptoms, mechanisms, causes, and successful coping strategies for burnout and workaholism. It also takes a look at the general stress response on the physiological level and at some of the damage American society inflicts on itself.",

      "title": "Reflections on therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Every morning I walk my dog 2 miles. Every evening before bed I spend some time in an outdoor hot tub. I describe these daily routines as therapeutic, which is probably no surprise to anyone reading this message. A large part of me resists this label; it sounds so clinical, and these things are my fun, my relaxation. At the same time I am conscious of certain and predictable experiences when I either do or do not do these things. Both of these activities are relaxing. At the same time, they are energizing. I experience an uplifting of my mind and spirit; my body is more attuned and limber than before. My general ability to cope with day-to-day challenges is clearly improved each time I walk or soak. I let go of fears and uncertainties. The best gift of all is that when I am at a loss as to what to do, or feel that my resources are depleted, during both activities some possibilities emerge and I am once again ready to move forward. But despite these clear and marvelous benefits, I cannot explain, exactly, what has created the habits or routines. The hot tub is easy-at the end of each day I have little difficulty thinking about and turning to the relaxing and warm waters of the hot tub. The walk is a different story. If it were not for my dog's chocolate brown gazing eyes, and her restless 120-lb body beckoning me to garb up and get going, I would not do it. The demands of the day often seem so pressing that I could easily (and sometimes do) skip the walk. But 10 minutes into it, I sense a shift of mood and mind to a gladness that I am outside walking and not inside stirring. These activities are for me clearly beneficial, and I need no scientific evidence to convince me that they are. I do not require specific medical or physical evidence to know that continuing their indulgence is something from which I will benefit. I cannot tell you why I walk 2 miles, or why I keep the water in the tub at 104 degrees F. I cannot explain what might happen if I ran or sat in a steam bath instead. I honestly am not interested in all the \"whys\" and \"hows.\" As a nurse, I can share my experience with others and make suggestions and recommendations about activities that might also benefit another individual. But the evidence, or the basis on which I might make these recommendations, is as yet only scant. The questions and issues for which I have no answers, or in which I have no interest where my personal \"therapeutics\" are concerned, are indeed critical for the development of nursing therapeutics. Nurses and nurse scholars have many important issues to debate around the concept of nursing therapeutics. At the same time, in today's environment and as public servants or stewards, it is time to turn collectively to developing strong scientific evidence that supports accountability for what we do and how we do it. As a discipline we need strong conviction and rationale concerning what counts as \"scientific evidence,\" pushing the boundaries of this concept outward and into more inclusive realms. But nurses need to step outside of these important debates and diligently pursue all means at our disposal-both mainstream and marginal-to gather evidence concerning our healing actions and approaches. As we do so, we will, I am convinced, have a strong voice in the public discourse concerning the future of health care. This issue of ANS contains important substantive articles contributing to the discourse about nursing therapeutics and the claims we can make concerning nursing therapeutics. It also serves to stimulate new ideas, visions of methodologic approaches, and directions for further scholarship in this area. I invite you, the reader, to write with your ideas and responses and let us all benefit from your contribution to the discourse. Peggy L. Chinn, RN, PhD, FAAN Editor",

The death drive then races upon the mare of envy, violating all representations of what one has, and all virtue. At times the death drive is directed particularly towards oneself, for the purpose of annihilating the gaps and avenging feelings of inferiority.

Knowledge itself then becomes traumatized, losing the power to inform and mobilize action. Survivors become habituated to suffering in a manner that subverts meaning, dampens vitality as well as pain, and arrests empathic connectedness. The dearth of transferential cues in such depleted existences leaves analysts in doubt as to whether they have been unintrusive or unavailable to these patients. Restoring survivors' sense of being witnessed requires interpretive actions that acknowledge the suffering that survivors have lost the will and means to make known or even represent. Such interventions draw on analysts' own projective identifications and use of the self, counterposing the will to live against the resignation to unwitnessed terror.",

      "title": "Back From the Brink",
      "abstract": "You have accessThe ASHA LeaderFeature1 May 2014Back From the BrinkSome people who stutter have at some point felt so depressed that they’ve considered extreme measures. How have they become so lost? And how have they found their way back? Katherine Preston Katherine Preston Google Scholar More articles by this author https://doi.org/10.1044/leader.FTR2.19052014.44 SectionsAbout ToolsAdd to favorites ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Communication and emotion are caught up in such a delicate dance, and some of it isn’t pretty. The ability to be heard by others, to listen to what the world has to offer each day, to share readily and easily one’s memories, experiences, opinions and dreams—all contribute to a sense of social completeness and belonging, to feelings of contentment. The reverse is also true. Emotional responses to communication disorders—how we react to the continual threat of being isolated from friends, family, colleagues and peers—can run a complex gamut, sometimes over the course of a single day. Sometimes we accept, other times we might get frustrated, angry or really depressed. Originating in a well-received ASHA convention session, Katherine Preston’s powerful piece profiles two people who stutter who confronted the darkness at the extreme end of this cascading emotional spectrum. With the help of speech-language pathologists, Scott Palasik and Tim returned to the light. While there are no data to indicate a higher rate of suicide among people who stutter, we know anecdotally that thoughts of suicide do occur among people with communication disorders, including stuttering. Why? Sometimes it seems just too much. As I have previously shared, I—a life-long stutterer—once became so depressed because of my disorder, so lost, so cut off from purpose and future, that I traveled the dark road taken by Palasik and Tim. Others have also confided to me about their or their friends’ experiences at the brink. Such extreme reactions are not limited to people who stutter, of course. In this issue, we also take a look at depression among those struggling with aphasia, dementia and traumatic brain injury. There are many ways for SLPs to help. Raw emotional responses to communication disorders cannot help spilling over in treatment, on display for clinicians on the frontlines of helping, intervention and prevention. In this issue, Joseph Donaher and Lisa Scott offer detailed advice for communication sciences and disorders clinicians dealing with clients who are wrestling with mental health issues in general, some of whom may be contemplating suicide. As the authors make clear, such instances are rare but they do happen. The clients they discuss are not just people who stutter, but also people affected by other types of communication disorders. Any client seen by a communication professional could face the types of difficulties described in this piece. A two-hour session at the 2014 ASHA Convention will focus on this specific topic. “Clients at Risk For Suicide: Our Experiences and Responsibilities,” led by Joseph Donaher, Robert Fifer, Barbara Froman, Judith Kuster, Scott Palasik and Rachel Wynn, will look at depression, anxiety and isolation in people with a variety of communicative disorders; the possibility that they will contemplate suicide; and risk of suicide completion. We hope that this issue will help sensitize readers to this possibility and offer some guidance about providing these clients with the help that they need. —Gary Dunham, editor-in-chief, The ASHA Leader As a kid, Tim found it hard to swallow a single pill. His mother had to crush them up to get him to take them. And yet here he was, at the age of 26, throwing back handfuls. Almost 20 Zoloft, followed by a fistful of Celexa. Then he started on the second bottle of vodka. Always the perfectionist, he was determined to do it right. He’d been researching for months. The Celexa had been prescribed by his psychiatrist to help with depression and he’d ordered the Zoloft illegally from Canada. Planning had given him a release when things got really bad. It had been that way since he was 16, since he’d first stood on a bridge and thought about jumping. Since he’d first imagined an escape from stuttering. It was hours before dawn, the bars were long closed. No one was walking past the street corner he’d chosen and no one knew he was there. His mind became lucid—too late, he realized the enormity of what he had set in motion. He thought about his mother, he thought about the life that he was leaving behind. It stopped, he went numb. Then nothing. Listening to the unspoken Roughly 1 million people kill themselves every year worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, global suicide rates have increased by 60 percent over the past 45 years and someone in the United States takes his or her own life approximately every 14 minutes. It is estimated that more people die by suicide than by car accidents. We do not know how many in those statistics are people who stutter, but we know that they are among those numbers (see “Be Prepared to Help At-Risk Clients”). We know that stuttering can breed its own fatalities. And yet, we do not talk about it. Just as stuttering itself has long remained taboo, the convergence of stuttering and suicide remains largely unreported and shrouded in guilt. We are not alone in that silence. As David Satcher, the U.S. surgeon general, puts it, “As a society we do not like to talk about suicide.” Perhaps we want to maintain the illusion that suicide is rare, that it is a rash act done only by the cowardly, the selfish and the permanently unstable. Perhaps the survivors want to look ahead and leave their experiences unearthed in the past. Whatever our reasons, the result is an epidemic that remains misunderstood. We need to debunk those myths and open up the conversation. In truth, it is hard to take your own life. It takes a sort of overwhelming desperation that most of us are lucky not to have known. And yet, no one is exempt from pain and suffering. All of us have known darkness at some point in our lives. So what combined state of mind drives someone to believe that life is too painful to go on living, and what saves people from the brink? Psychologist Thomas Joiner, author of “Why People Die By Suicide” and “Myths About Suicide,” believes that people kill themselves when they have both the desire to die and the ability to die. His danger zone emerges when three tightly defined, overlapping conditions create a “pathway to suicide.” Isolation Joiner calls the first condition “thwarted belongingness.” He argues that the desire to die begins with loneliness, an unfulfilled desire for inclusion and connection. As someone who stutters, I once knew the state of isolation well. Not in the sense that I was often on my own, but rather that I struggled alone with my inner demons and felt stifled by my difference. For much of my life, I believed that my voice cut me off from the “normal” world. I believed that other people only heard the words that I would allow myself to say, the mangled approximation of the unspoken words piling up in my head. I’ve heard stories of others who were bullied mercilessly because of their speech (see “Bullying Be Gone”). I talked to some of these people about their experiences of feeling excluded, misunderstood, unloved and ashamed by their inability to control their own bodies. They spoke to me about being imprisoned and silenced by their stutter. One of them is Scott Palasik, today a speech-language pathologist, artist and counselor. As a teenager he never imagined that life for himself. He remembers worrying that people were judging him because of his voice. On the rare occasion that he spoke up in class, he felt hot and small, as if the room was on top of him pushing down. “I thought that my stutter was in control of everything, that it dictated my path and made me quiet and shy,” he says. “I thought that it told people that I was dumb in some way.” The summer after his senior year of high school, tired of struggling, he decided to stop speaking. “I didn’t talk for about six months.” He believed that if he didn’t talk, then he wouldn’t be judged, and possibly he wouldn’t judge himself. And yet, that silence created an acute sense of loneliness. As Palasik stopped talking, people gradually stopped talking to him. His rage toward his stutter turned toward himself, making him blind to all the people who did care for him. “It snowballed into this idea that if I was alone anyway, then what did it matter if I was dead or alive?” He started to think that he would be better off dead. “And coming to that conclusion wasn’t scary,” he says. “That’s what is so scary about people who are suicidal: These thoughts do not scare you. It feels right, it feels natural.” Liability Returning to Thomas Joiner’s conditions that create a pathway to suicide: the second is “perceived burdensomeness.” He argues that when people see themselves as effective, they maintain the will to live. But when they feel like a liability, when they feel as if they are letting others down, that will to live can be sorely tested. It is this condition that debunks the myth that suicide is a selfish act. In reality, it often comes closer to mistaken, or misguided, heroism. Suicide wasn’t a selfish thing for Tim. If it was, he would have killed himself years ago. Rather, he felt like he was a burden on those around him, he felt like he was letting them down. He was completing his final adult case management placement for his social work degree, but he kept dropping cases because he was so afraid of talking on the phone. He prided himself on his ability to battle through, to take care of those around him. But he believed that he was failing: at school, at his job, at speech-language treatment. He wanted to be perfect and he couldn’t meet that impossible ideal. Many of the people who talked to me about feeling suicidal remembered their lowest moments being those times when they felt hopeless about their future, when they couldn’t get work, when they felt like their stutter was trapping them into a smaller and smaller life, when they felt helpless to change their situation. They spoke about worrying that they were letting down their families. They spoke about the perils of feeling useless, of feeling depressed, of turning to drugs or alcohol when they could no longer square off against that monster called stuttering. Nothing left to fear Joiner calls his final condition for suicide “fearlessness” or “the ability to die.” Killing yourself is not cowardly or weak or impulsive. Neither is it laudable. But it takes a certain kind of courage to numb yourself to violence. Our impulse to survive is hardwired into us. It explains why so many people save themselves at the brink. Palasik had started to drive home at night with his eyes closed. He would listen to the sounds of the road and imagine “hitting a car, a tree, a house, going off the road and into a bottomless ravine.” Eyes closed, he would feel the car veer off the road, he would feel the rocks crunch under the wheels, thinking that this was what he wanted. And then some instinct would save him, something screaming at him that he wasn’t done, that he still had a voice. He’d open his eyes and swerve back, just missing mailboxes and trees. Sometimes he’d be inches from oncoming cars. Our survival instinct is often strong enough to save us, and yet the ability to die can develop over time. A lifetime of numbing ourselves to painful physical experiences can make us strong in ways that can galvanize or break us. For some, the strength that comes from the daily battle of speaking can be transformed into something deadly. Salvation in belonging Suicide is not an unfathomably psychotic state. Rather is made up of circles that we have all stepped into, or skimmed close by. The gaps between us are not so wide. So what saves people from an attempt to kill themselves? And, perhaps more important, what helps them recover from the desire to kill themselves? The answer seems to lie in the life­saving power of belonging. Palasik believes that he owes his life to the people who reached out to him along the way. The first person to notice the change was his friend Gina. “She noticed I wasn’t talking, smiling or engaging,” he says. “She got mad at me and said, ‘Bub! You gotta talk.’ I just shook my head. She called a speech pathologist right there in front of me. I had nothing to lose, I was certain I would be dead within the year.” He went to the SLP and was surprised to find that the sessions weren’t filled with anything except another person sitting there, waiting for him to talk. “That was the greatest gift she gave me, just waiting without any judgment or agenda,” Palasik recalls. He went back every week for a year and a half. For years, he still thought about death as an option, but the feeling of being drawn toward living began within six months of starting treatment. In spite of their experiences, or perhaps because of them, Palasik and Tim are both men who cling to life. They are the type of people you want to be around, the ones with the infectious laughs, the kind eyes and the compassionate minds. They are the ones who help others feel less alone by telling their stories. They prove that there is hope, that the unrelenting grayness will end, that the indefatigable human spirit is strong enough to climb out of almost any dark place. Tim woke up in a hospital bed, looking up at nurses and doctors. They told him that somebody had found him and called an ambulance just in time. He was so weak that a friend had to carry him home. Six months later he went to his first ELSA (European League of Stuttering Associations) youth group meeting. Whereas some people might have found it hard to walk into that cacophony of stuttering, he loved it. He felt at home, as if he could tell them anything. Looking back, Tim feels as if the darkest parts of him died when he took that overdose; it changed something in him. Today suicide is no longer an option. He looks after himself to deal with any lingering traces of depression, he meditates, he has learned to let go. Spending time with other stutterers has made him think that he might like himself less if he was fluent, because they have taught him that acceptance and vulnerability can give him the freedom he always craved. Beyond his mother and his family, he feels that he has people to live for. As he puts it, “It is only the beginning of the journey. I have so much more to do, and so much more to say.” Suicide Risk Heightened Among Those With Aphasia, Dementia, TBI The risk of suicide is significantly increased, relative to the general population, among some people with acquired brain injuries, particularly aphasia, primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia, and traumatic brain injury. It is not uncommon for people with stroke-associated lesions in the left anterior cortex to experience depression, including thoughts of suicide, as post-stroke major depression is significantly associated with left anterior lesions, especially during the two years after the stroke. Diagnosing post-stroke depression can be challenging— especially in the context of language impairment—and it often goes unrecognized and untreated. A National Aphasia Association survey indicated that more than 90 percent of people with aphasia feel isolated and lonely and have a diminished sense of belonging. Although suicide incidence is relatively low among those with aphasia—about 1 in 2,000 cases (see sources)—the possibility that a person with aphasia will contemplate or attempt suicide merits serious consideration. It is also not uncommon to see depression and suicidal behavior among people with primary progressive aphasia or semantic dementia—a degenerative disorder that selectively affects semantic knowledge until the later stages of the disease. One study estimated that approximately 20 percent of patients with semantic dementia contemplate suicide and approximately 10 percent of these patients will attempt suicide. People who survive a traumatic brain injury may also be at increased risk of suicide. Researchers Grahame Simpson and Robyn Tate found high levels of suicide attempts (18 percent) and clinically significant suicide ideation (21 to 22 percent) among people with severe TBI in research reported in 2007 in Brain Injury. Even among those who sustain only a mild TBI, the risk of suicide increases approximately 3 to 4 percent relative to the general population. Veterans with a history of TBI are 1.5 percent more likely to die of suicide than those without a history of TBI. Thus, SLPs who treat patients with aphasia, dementia or TBI should recognize that these patients are at special risk of committing suicide, particularly if they have depression and preserved insight. For some patients, that risk may be exacerbated by the risk of suicide associated with normal aging. Among the elderly, factors associated with attempted suicide include being unmarried, living alone, low education level, history of psychiatric treatment, and previous suicide attempt. SLPs and audiologists who understand the factors that increase risk associated with these conditions and learn to recognize symptoms of possible suicidal behavior may be able to make better clinical decisions regarding suicide risk evaluation in these vulnerable groups. Given that we often spend more time than most other health care professionals communicating with patients, SLPs and audiologists have a responsibility to be aware that some of patients may be “on the brink” and to provide them with the counseling and referrals that they and their loved ones may desperately need. —Margaret Rogers, ASHA Chief Staff Officer for Science and Research Resources Anxiety and Depression Association of America, www.adaa.org Brain Injury Association of America, www.biausa.org Mental Health and Aging, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov/aging/mentalhealth National Aphasia Association, www.aphasia.org National Stroke Association, www.stroke.org National Stuttering Association, www.westutter.org The Stuttering Foundation of America, www.stutteringhelp.org VA Mental Health Services for Veterans and Families, www.mentalhealth.va.gov Sources Benson D.

      "title": "Ten Tips for Building Strong Relationships in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "BE CAPABLE AND CULPABLE. Enhance your ability to establish a connection with someone at work by being a person who can be counted on to do what you say you will do and to take responsibility if everything does not turn out exactly as planned. No one truly likes someone who is not dependable. BE RESPECTFUL. Treat your coworkers with courtesy and deference to your opinion that they have value in the workplace. The underlying goal is to establish mutual respect. You exhibit respect toward them, and they reciprocate. Aretha Franklin’s version of the classic Otis Redding song, “Respect,” nailed it — people want and need to be held in righteous regard. BE A GOOD LISTENER. Lend an ear. Hear what your coworkers are trying to say to you. Arguably, successfully interacting with someone entails both listening and discerning what they are trying to communicate to you. A nonverbal form of flattery, listening can help those to whom you are speaking feel valued and supported. BE OPEN MINDED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. Never forget that every person is different. As such, each individual has a unique array of attributes that he or she brings to the workplace. In that regard, try to focus on his or her positive characteristics. Although diversity can, to a degree, generate a variety of challenges, depending on the situation, it also can provide an assortment of perspectives, views, and ideas that can collectively strengthen the workplace. BE MINDFUL. Practice a deeper level of awareness with regard to your words and your actions. In other words, always consider your words before you actually say them or what you plan to do before really doing it. Always keep in mind that you can’t “unring a bell once you ring it” (i.e., “can’t put the genie back in the bottle”). If you say or do something that damages your relationship with a coworker, the effect can be long lasting if not permanent. BE A PROPONENT OF THE “GOLDEN RULE.” Treat your coworkers as you would like them to treat you. In that regard, emphasize and practice a values-orientation approach to what you do at work and how you interact with others. Be honest, trustworthy, and ethical at all times. Be known as a person of resolute integrity. BE GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME. Never forget that giving your time to someone is one of the most valuable (and thoughtful) gifts you can bestow on another person. You only have so much time in your life. As such, you are giving them a part of your life that you can never get back. As a rule, individuals who are on the receiving end of your time will recognize it for what it is — a measure of goodness on your part. BE AWARE OF YOUR BODY LANGUAGE. Know that your body can speak volumes when interacting with someone else. Smiling and maintaining eye contact can be effective ways to enhance how other people perceive that you feel about being around them. In turn, rolling your eyes, shaking hands weakly, crossing your arms or legs, constantly checking your watch, and touching your face during conversation are examples of gestures that you should avoid if you’re trying to connect with someone. BE OPEN TO GIVING (AND RECEIVING) CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK. Be cognizant of the fact that offering a person meaningful feedback is a demonstrable way of trying to help and support that individual. All factors considered, it is an act of “caring and sharing” — caring enough about the coworker to give that person information that can assist him or her personally or professionally (e.g., in his or her career). Accordingly, it should be perceived as an act of trying to boost that person, rather than to tear him or her down. BE POSITIVE. Never forget that, as a rule, no one likes to be around negativity. Life, including the workplace, can be challenging enough without being unduly exposed to someone who displays an ongoing negative attitude. All factors considered, a positive person focuses on the bright side of life — health, happiness, and success. Most individuals tend to ascribe to the belief that if you expect the best, your chances of getting the best are enhanced…and vice versa.",

But in our rational moments we make preparations. We write advance directives. We execute durable powers of attorney. We give instructions to loved ones: “No tubes, no machines.” That's the wrong approach, I think. All this stuff we put together doesn't guarantee that what we say we want will actually happen or that we'll have what we'd call a “good death”—what you would think of as a good death for you .",

The withheld love is felt as a fatal impediment to living, and some kind of magical reparation from the abuser is imagined as the only hope of being brought back to life. What is often dissociated by these patients, who present a part of themselves that feels like an eternally ruined victim, is the intense frustrated rage they feel. The author describes his work with a profoundly dissociative patient whose powerful rage emerged, towards herself, towards others, and towards the therapist. The author suggests that it is critical to identify this rage and its destructive impact on the patient, her relationships and on the therapy, for the grip of the fantasy of magic reparation to be released.",

      "title": "Trust and Sincerity in Art",
      "abstract": "Our life with art is suffused with trust. We don’t just trust one another’s aesthetic testimony; we trust one another’s aesthetic actions. Audiences trust artists to have made it worth their while; artists trust audiences to put in the effort. Without trust, audiences would have little reason to put in the effort to understand difficult and unfamiliar art. I offer a theory of aesthetic trust, which highlights the importance of trust in aesthetic sincerity. We trust in another’s aesthetic sincerity when we rely on them to fulfill their commitments to act for aesthetic reasons—rather than for, say, financial, social, or political reasons. We feel most thoroughly betrayed by an artist, not when they make bad art, but when they sell out. This teaches us something about the nature of trust in general. According to many standard theories, trust involves taking the trusted to be cooperative or good-natured. But trust in aesthetic sincerity is different. We trust artists to be true to their own aesthetic sensibility, which might involve selfishly ignoring their audience’s needs. Why do we care so much about an artist’s sincerity, rather than merely trusting them to make good art? We emphasize sincerity when wish to encourage originality, rather than demanding success along predictable lines. And we ask for sincerity when our goal is to discover a shared sensibility. In moral life, we often try to force convergence through coordinated effort. But in aesthetic life, we often hope for the lovely discovery that our sensibilities were similar all along. And for that we need to ask for sincerity, rather than overt coordination.",

Some things are personally significant to you. But when is something significant to you? In this paper, we advance the contact account of significance. You are in contact with a value when it is manifest in your life or when your life is manifest in it. And it is this contact with a value that makes it significant to you. We argue that this captures standard cases of personal relationships to people, objects, and projects. We then suggest that it explains various other normative phenomena too: our reasons of gratitude and compensation, as well as how we discount for temporal and modal distance. In light of its theoretical virtues and explanatory power, we conclude, the contact account is worth taking seriously indeed.",

Some individuals love selflessly, even without any hope for reciprocation. We all wait for someone who makes us feel unique and adds extraordinary value to our lives. However, love also demands sacrifices; sometimes, our love becomes the reason for someone's pain. In love, one should not be selfish and should not expect reciprocation from the other person. Love is unconditional and knows no bounds. \"If someone does not love you, you do not have to convince them to love you back. True love comes naturally when you truly care for someone. Only when someone who loves you disappears from your life do you realise their importance? In contemporary times, everyone desires to be loved and to love in return. We are all lonely people who crave love and care. No one can love someone like Radha loved Lord Krishna. “Their love is everlasting and serves as an example of true love for future generations. Their love, respect, and care for each other cannot be matched.

      "abstract": "The human spirit is capable of responding to the whole range of emotions and experiences that form the lifespan of an individual. It is the agency that registers emotions across the whole spectrum; from the elation of joy at wondrous experiences, events, achievements and relationships, to the despair and degradation of profound pain and loss. Whilst most of us are treated to great pleasures and exquisitely lofty emotional highs on occasions, some live lives of endless oppression and cruel misuse. So reflecting on our past lives, as we all do, may be affirming and pleasurable. It may be harrowing, painful, full of guilt and anger. Or it may be a mixture of these two extremes, with the mix changing at different times and in different circumstances. As we get closer to the end of life this life review and self-evaluation becomes more frequent and more problematic.",

So it got to the point where I couldn't even open up the blinds, I didn't want to look outside, you know, it was so fearful of what life was going to be like, you know, since all this that I didn't know if I could physically live in this life. And the bushfires and COVID combined definitely had a huge impact on that.

      "abstract": "Hope accompanies man in the pursuit of fulfilling something that is essential and necessary for human existence. It counteracts the sense of loss of the most important values for a human being. A lack of hope leads people to despair; and thus often to make decisions leading to irreversible life situations. Hope lets people pass through the most difficult moments and periods of life. On the one hand; it shapes the existential vision of a human being; filled with his trust; faith in a better; favorable destiny; and on the other - affects his sense of transcendence; which pervades comfort. Hope improves human life. And although there is no hope without fear; it is the way of seeking the meaning of life. Hope is a force that especially protects those who are on the verge of despair that takes the sense of bleakness. As a rational being assigned to the structure of personality of every human being; it can be perceived in several contradictory dimensions. Hope is the cause that improves all dimensions of every human life. It realizes itself through the world of values to which a human is heading without which he cannot shape the quality of his life. Hope has its own structure through which one should understand a certain system of peculiar properties coming with different strength into mutual relations; which are both its elements and constitute the whole that decide for the individual and unique character of the sense of hope in the case of every human being. The question arises about the meaning of hope; its place and role in pedagogical processes; in which the conscious subjects are people that are brought up and raised. The pedagogy of hope is an attempt to penetrate the essence of particularly important elements/factors supporting the development of the human personality.",

The process of grief and mourning is antithetical to all they know: grief takes time – a long time. There is no going back to how we were before a significant loss. One loss inevitably recalls other losses – grief piles up.

      "title": "A Mistaken Case of Identity",
      "abstract": "My historic passion perches precariously on the line between obsession and passion. It begins often as a small thought, evolves into a chain of enquiry and then erupts into uncontrolled feelings that arouse, inflame and anger me. This intensity of feeling obliges me to seek a scientific, rational method of explanation for such perturbation. Here, historical enquiry and methodology come to the rescue and the mental agitation is briefly contained, but only to be re-awakened by clumsy attempts by others to disregard the presence of my tormentor, and by my own efforts to force me to provide a home for my unwelcome guest. What is this passion that so consumes me from time to time? It's the search for my identity, of course; an identity that has been shaped by history and continues to be shaped in manifold ways. Some passions are intensely pleasurable, others turn into a quest for answers to interminable questions. Worst of all is the question about my 'national identity'. Over the years I have come to discover that to ignore this question is to invite trouble. Hence, I have fashioned, reluctantly at first, and then with gusto, a passion for nailing down the roots of my so-called 'national identity'. I must first explain that I am what is termed in a number of forums a Black Briton. I don't particularly feel comfortable with this title. In fact, I don't feel comfortable with being labelled or categorized at all but I have come to accept that historians and sociologists must have their categories, and bureaucrats must have their means of identification too. This doesn't mean that I accept them. I am happier to explain my assigned 'national identity' in political and historical terms, which often offends the person who asks the question, 'where do you come from?' I would like, therefore, to outline my reasons for choosing to explain my identity using history and not socially-constructed categories and how it has become a passion. I was born in London in 1963. My parents had arrived in 1961, as immigrants, from what is known as Guyana today but was known then as British Guiana. In British Guiana, my mother had been training to be a classroom assistant and my father was a policeman in the Guianese CID. Both had been encouraged to emigrate to the British 'motherland' to increase their chances of promotion in their professions, raise their standard of living and perhaps, more importantly for them, to provide their children with an education and a chance to raise themselves out of poverty. Leaving one's homeland for distant shores is a heart-rending decision for any family to make but in British Guiana there were many factors forcing families to",

      "title": "Going Away to Think: Engagement, Retreat, and Ecocritical Responsibility",
      "abstract": "In this book's most complex and moving essay, “Be Prepared for the Worst,” a narrative of grief and loss nearly disappears into non-chronological fragments of reflection and scholarship. Even when the story surfaces, the reader is pulled away into analyses of the literature and politics of population, environmental economics, extinction, and imperialist nostalgia. Midway through the author asks, “Do you feel it slipping away yet, the lyrical intensity of the narrative voice?” (50). But there is no compromise, and the essay courageously plunges onward, never retreating from the pose of the scholar even through nearly stifling self-reflexivity. The essay embodies the tension between the pull toward personal reflection and the imperative to attend to communities of knowledge and of action. Yet the book aims for more. Scott Slovic wants to see these urges as complementary. “Why must the cycling between engagement and retreat result in ‘torment’?” he asks. “I arise in the morning eager to savor and to save, hoping to draw upon each impulse in support of the other” (5).",

      "title": "Developing Your Text and Managing the Writing Process",
      "abstract": "For creative non-fiction the heart of the authoring process is a person sitting at a desk, surrounded by information, notes, scribbles and sources, or otherwise jammed with ideas, and struggling to organize their thoughts on a blank screen or sheet of paper. This particular image is so dominant in our thinking about authoring because it is so awe-full, so hard to manage your way through at the time, so difficult to capture what you were doing afterwards, and so psychologically stressful or unnerving to contemplate at almost any time. In another field, writing novels, its practitioners' collective obsession with the angst of an author imagining something out of nothing has gone even further, as John Fowles noted ironically: Serious modern fiction has only one subject, the difficulty of writing serious modern fiction … . The natural consequence of this is that writing about fiction has become a far more important matter than writing fiction itself. It's one of the best ways you can tell a true novelist nowadays. He's not going to waste his time over the messy garage-mechanic drudge of assembling stories and characters on paper … Yes, all right. Obviously he has at some point to write something, just to show how irrelevant and unnecessary the actual writing part of it is. But that's all.",

      "abstract": "ficant than how he says it, fantasies are more significant than events, the unexpected always more significant than the expected, unless one's expectations were generated by a theory that rejects ordinary assumptions and intuitions. Genius and madness share techniques. And so on. The metaphor has been heuristic and certainly productive. And yet like most metaphors, even as it directs our attention towards certain truths, it distracts us from others. There are important differences in the aim and the form of the two ventures, in the texts and the contexts. Imagine a poet or a novelist on the analyst's couch, generating a text, furnishing material for the psychoanalysis, while the analyst listens, occasionally takes a note, keeps track of the slow progress of the minute hand, and now and then asks a question or, more rarely, ventures an interpretation. Imagine the same writer alone, writing, generating another text, furnishing material, he hopes,1 for the literary critic, and for his private vision of the common reader, the person who knows nothing of deconstruction, but who is guided by an instinct to create for himself; out of whatever odds and ends he can come by, some kind of whole.2 Rather than reviewing what these events and their products and consequences have in common, I would like to discuss a few of their most fundamental differences. First, the writer and the patient have different aims and different audiences. Likewise the psychoanalyst has different aims than the literary critic, and looks to different audiences. Second, there are differences in the texts themselves, and in the tools (and liberties) available to the interpreter, partly due to the differences in the aims of the speaker, and partly due to differences in the form of the relationship between the two parties.",

      "abstract": "You say something at a meeting, it is ignored, then someone else says the same thing and everyone embraces it as a marvelous idea. You devote yourself to a project, but don't get credit for the results. You work around the clock to avoid a crisis, but your efforts are not recognized because no one notices a crisis that never occurs. You give what you think are clear instructions, but the job is not done, or is done wrong. Sometimes it seems you are not getting heard, not getting credit for your efforts, not getting ahead as fast as you should. Many of us spend more of our lives at work than we do at home, yet while we choose our life-partners and friends, at work we are thrown together with people we did not choose, some of whom we don't understand and may not even like. In Talking from 9 to 5, Deborah Tannen brings to the workplace the same compelling voice, keen eye, and deep insight that made That's Not What I Meant! and You Just Don't Understand best-selling classics. Here, she offers powerful new ways of understanding what happens in the workplace, ranging from the simplest exchanges to the complex contemporary issues of the glass ceiling and sexual harassment. Work is a special world because as we talk to get our jobs done, we are also being evaluated. How we get others to do what we want, and how we accept or avoid responsibility for mistakes, display or challenge authority, reveal or conceal what we don't know - all affect how we are regarded and rewarded. Individuals in positions of authority are judged by how they enact that authority. This poses a particular challenge for women, since the ways that women are expected to talk are at odds with our usual images of authority.Women at work often have ways of creating authority that can be misinterpreted as a lack of confidence or even competence. Tannen maintains that no one style of speaking is superior. She does not tell women to speak like men or men to speak like women. Instead, she explains a variet",

      "abstract": "Abstract Memories of early child abuse can be read in at least two distinct ways-as true accounts of an unspeakable event or as metaphors for a wide range of boundary violations which belong to both past and present. An actual memory of an early experience tends to fade unless repeatedly rehearsed; because abuse memories are inherently shameful, it seems reasonable to be skeptical of this kind of repetition and to be suspicious of their sudden emergence. An actual memory of an early experience would be told from the child's point of view and would probably contain many false starts, internal contradictions, and all the other earmarks of a confused memory that refer to an early happening; by contrast, a seamless account with a tight narrative structure and an almost total absence of doubt or irrelevant detail is almost certainly false. An actual memory would tend to have its own flavor and style; by contrast, a memory of child abuse that sounds too much like other memories is more likely a metaphor for something else. Therapists, lawyers, and other professionals need to be trained to listen metaphorically to these accounts, to be on guard against hearing them as concrete references to a particular time and place, and to beware of reinforcing them prematurely.",

To capture that phenomenon, we might repurpose an old word: lapidation. Technically, the word is a synonym for stoning, but it sounds much less violent. It is also obscure, which makes it easier to enlist for contemporary purposes. Lapidation plays a role in affirming, and helping to constitute, tribal identity. It typically occurs when a transgressor is taken to have violated a taboo, which helps account for the different people and events that trigger left-of-center and right-of-center lapidation. One of the problems with lapidation is that it often accomplishes little; it expresses outrage, and allows people to signal their identity, but does no more. Victims of lapidation might be tempted to apologize, but apologies can prove ineffective or even make things worse, depending on the nature of the lapidators.",

On one level, apathy is familiar and commonplace, as a way of describing a lack of response or action commensurate with increasingly urgent ecological challenges we have been experiencing and face in the future. On another level, when we explore apathy through a psychoanalytic lens, the picture changes quite dramatically, and becomes altogether more complicated.",

      "title": "Symposium Introduction: Epistemic Vices: Moving Beyond Saints and Sinners",
      "abstract": "Perfect epistemic agents do not exist. People are messy. We make mistakes; we are error-prone. We have limited attention spans, sluggish cognitive processing powers, pedestrian interpersonal skills, inefficient and unreliable memories. At times we struggle to get out of our own way — the vagaries of life, relationships, and responsibilities, both individually and collectively, take a toll, especially in dopamine-seeking, split-attention environments. Such pressures keep us from being the very best version of themselves. More often than not, we are less than we ought to be. Specifically, all of us have flawed intellectual characters to some extent or another, which is to be expected. We are human after all. Flaws are encoded in our DNA. It comes as no surprise then, that there are times when we are defective inquirers — suboptimal or blameworthy epistemic agents. Prejudice, irrationality, superbia, closed-mindedness, epistemic entrenchment, willful ignorance, insouciance, my-side bias, to name but a few, all have the potential to colonize and deleteriously influence our capacities to efficiently and effectively acquire, share, produce, and audit knowledge, or to engage in responsible and effective inquiry. All this leaves us with a choice. Should educationalists pursue a virtue-based account of other-worldly epistemic excellence based on knowledge gained via strictly controlled laboratory conditions, or would it be more profitable to seek richer understandings of the flawed nature, scope, identity, and significance of our intellectual character traits, attitudes, and ways of thinking, and how they systematically, though not invariably, block the path to knowledge?1 Intellectual vices is a way of talking about those deleterious epistemic character traits, attitudes, and modes of thinking that reflect our imperfect epistemic desires and that get in the way of successful epistemic pursuits. Though various scholars understand the nature of epistemic vice in distinctive ways, there are currently two main perspectives: motivationalism and obstructivism.2 The former characterizes epistemic vice in terms of imperfect epistemic motivations, while the latter understands it in consequentialist terms: more specifically, that which obstructs the acquisition, retention, and transmission of knowledge. Virtue epistemologists pursue normative accounts regarding how prototypical thinkers under ideal conditions should think. Vice epistemologists, on the other hand, take a more true-to-life view of matters. They look to our zetetic failings and present an explanatory account of the way in which corrupted motivations and flawed intellectual character traits get in the way of knowledge. Broadly put, their interests hinge on understanding how, why, and under what circumstances specific vices of the mind (both personal and collective intellectual failings) obstruct the acquisition, retention, auditing, and transmission of knowledge. So, what are the epistemic vices? Etymologically, \"vice\" derives from the Latin word vitium, which is a fault or defect. If we take seriously our epistemic responsibilities, it stands to reason that we must develop a proper account of what goes wrong when we (individually and collectively) fail to acquire, transmit, and audit knowledge in credible ways. In cases where we have a measure of control with respect to remedying our vices, we also require guidance on how to mitigate or overcome them. On this approximation, epistemic vices might be conceptualized as intellectual character failings, vicious attitudes, or corrupted ways of thinking that systematically get in the way of knowledge. Since character traits, in part, explain what people do, scholars maintain that epistemic vices explain, at least to some extent, how people, more often than not, fail to appropriately think, reason, reflect, inquire, or evaluate relevant evidence, and stress-test the strength of competing claims.3 The relationship between epistemic vices and character traits is framed in dispositional terms. Vices, whether they are character traits, attitudes, or styles of thinking, first exist as dispositions. For instance, solubility is a disposition. On this view, dispositions are cashed out in terms of subjunctive conditionals. To say that sugar is soluble means that, if sugar were put in water, it would dissolve. Understood this way, dispositions are sensitive to certain stimulus events or conditions specific to them. Epistemic vices that are also character traits comprise tendencies to exhibit certain patterns of perception, feeling, thinking, reasoning, and behavior that obstruct the gaining, keeping, auditing, or sharing of knowledge. Like most robust character traits that are consistently manifested in a wide variety of trait-relevant eliciting conditions (including situations that are not always necessarily conducive to such behavior), they are habits of the heart-mind that are activated when the person comes into contact with the right activating conditions.4 In other words, they are stable dispositions to act, think, and feel in particular ways.5 Here are some examples of how this plays out in the real world. Closed-mindedness is a relatively familiar example of a characterological epistemic vice. First, to be clear: being closed-minded and thinking closed-mindedly represent the difference between a trait (what a person is predisposed toward) and an action (what a person does). Only part of what it is to be closed-minded is to think closed-mindedly. By thinking systematically in ways that are unreasonably entrenched, inflexible, insular, blinkered, irrationally defensive, and unreceptive or unresponsive to evidence that contravenes or threatens preexisting views, irrespective of the objective merits of such, closed-mindedness constitutes \"an unwillingness or inability to engage, or engage seriously, with relevant intellectual options.\"6 Yet this is only part of the story: there is more to being closed-minded than simply thinking closed-mindedly. This is why thinking vices are more basic than character ones. Without a proper grasp of thinking vices, the corresponding character vice remains conceptually elusive. One mistake is to view closed-mindedness as necessitating having already made up one's mind (i.e., forming a prejudgment)7 about a given topic. Closed-mindedness also pertains to the manner through which one arrives at beliefs or conducts inquiries, or the manner through which one seeks out and interprets the probative force of evidence. In real-world terms, closed-mindedness might manifest itself in exercising preferential treatment for certain select sources. It also might influence the types of questions one asks, how they are asked, the sequence in which they are asked, the time at which they are asked, the environment in which they are asked, and of whom they are asked.8 Since not all instances of closed-mindedness amount to reductionist instances of dismissing intellectual options, educators require more nuanced and conceptually robust understandings of the concept, including how it plays out in real-world conditions. To explain why, look at another example. Since closed-mindedness need not involve dismissing an option outright, more subtle or stealthy instantiations of the concept exist. Some closed-minded individuals overinflate the valency of other options. Some downplay options they would rather avoid, not to dismiss them per se, but just enough to cast sufficient doubt so that others start to worry about their evidential merits. Likewise, closed-mindedness need not just be about failing to engage with other valid options. Such failures, where blameworthy, come in degrees and are context-dependent. Depending on the particulars of the case at hand, one might interpretively silence others (by unjustly assigning them a credibility deficit or purposively misinterpreting their utterances to suit their own agenda), fail to seek out and marshal discordant perspectives responsibly, flatly ignore nonconformists or malcontents, or be wholly oblivious to some or all of the above at any one time. Epistemic vices often do not make much sense without understanding the attitudinal elements animating them. These attitudes express summary evaluations or appraisals of objects. To like or dislike something is to form a perspective on it, based on a particular evaluative description that shapes a perspective about that subject or object — a perspective that invariably comes in terms of degrees. For instance, I like soccer but dislike professional cycling. The extent to which I like soccer and dislike cycling can, in turn, be captured by means of attitudinal scales. Superbia (haughtiness), intellectual arrogance,9 and insouciance10 are noteworthy examples. Other paradigmatic cases include \"cognitive superiority complex,\"11 \"epistemic entrenchment\" (imperviousness to contradictory evidence or reasons),12 \"my-world myopia,\" and \"epistemic malevolence\" — a hostility or contempt for the good, including epistemic goods.13 \"My-world myopia\" is a phrase I coin to capture situations in which members of elite or dominant demographic groups consciously avoid knowledge about the experiences and lifeworlds of oppressed or marginalized groups14 in order to preserve psychologically comforting half-truths, to protect untested assumptions, to preserve unchecked privilege, and to evade accountability. For Quassim Cassam, insouciance captures the \"casual lack of concern about whether one's beliefs have any basis in reality or are adequately supported by the best available evidence.\"15 Arguably this vice captures the zeitgeist of ameliorative epistemology in educational discourse. Students who engage in bullshit (the primary product of insouciance), at least in Harry Frankfurt's analysis, do not care about facts, evidence, rationality, truth, or falsity. More precisely, since the bullshitter \"does not reject the authority of truth; he [simply] pays no attention to it at all,\"16 one can see the importance of educationalists focusing on scholarly conceptualizations of its forebearer, insouciance, framed here as a casual indifference (an epistemic apathy of sorts) to the truth, together with a stoic indifference to the central epistemic obligations to ground one's views in relevant facts, reasons, or evidence. The preceding discussion provides a useful context for the papers in this Educational Theory symposium. Understanding epistemic vices is the key to rehabilitation. And since vices can exist in either individual or social settings, each with their own context-dependent particularities, and each with deleterious consequences for inquirers and knowledge, educators require a robust understanding of how, why, and under what conditions such vices operate — and how the individual and social registers relate to and influence each other. The papers in this symposium all speak to the pedagogical dimensions of dealing with epistemic vices. David Coady in his paper \"Stop Talking about Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles\" takes issue with the pervasive focus on echo chambers and filter bubbles as the cause of epistemic vices. He argues that such ubiquitous concepts and their repurposing by epistemologists17 suffer from \"use-mention confusion\" whereby the \"emergence and proliferation of new terms has been mistaken for the emergence and proliferation of new phenomena to which these terms putatively refer.\"18 In a sense, he asks, \"what's new in the new?\"— a question theorists, in his view, fail to answer satisfactorily. The upshot of this conceptual fuzziness is that echo chambers and filter bubbles remain inconsistently defined in the literature and, as a consequence, lack explanatory usefulness. Extrapolating further, Coady presents a compelling argument as to why the pursuit of certain binary characterizations of political views is a fools' errand: the very idea that exposure to the \"other side\" neatly captures predefined and clearly demarcated opposing ideologies (liberal versus conservative, for instance) is so ingrained in Western culture that we have forgotten to examine these false dichotomies critically. This argument has ramifications for neologisms like \"epistemic bubbles\" and \"echo chambers,\" since the former putatively refers to \"social epistemic structure[s] which [have] inadequate coverage through a process of exclusion by omission,\" while the latter supposedly represents a \"significant disparity in trust between members and non-members.\"19 Taking epistemic bubbles to constitute situations in which other voices are not heard, while in echo chambers, \"other voices are actively undermined,\"20 both rely on oversimple dichotomies. Getting clear about what precisely constitutes epistemically discordant exchanges requires a deeper and more nuanced consideration of what characterizes a sufficiently rich and varied broad political spectrum, together with an understanding of the particular structures that supposedly foster it. For Coady, the focus on echo chambers and filter bubbles — even those colonized by epistemologists — amounts to a debate as to whether or not most people expose themselves to heterogenous political discourses. That is the issue to focus on; toward this purpose he finds the language of echo chambers and filter bubbles to be not only \"unnecessary\" but \"extremely harmful.\"21 The second paper in this collection examines whether interventionist epistemic paternalistic practices make us better evidentialist agents. In \"Can Epistemic Paternalistic Practice Make Us Better Epistemic Agents?,\" Giada Fratantonio looks to the purported benefits of using these as pedagogical tools with students to mitigate or eradicate what she refers to as \"evidential vices.\"22 Noting that much of the literature focuses on whether epistemic paternalism is a genuinely epistemic form of paternalism,23 as well as who is entitled to apply such interferences,24 there exists a lacuna regarding to what extent, if any, such practices are actually effective in making a student a better epistemic agent. Breaking new ground, she argues, contra Daniella Meehan,25 that epistemic nudges are both morally preferable and more effective in an instrumental sense. Principally, this argument turns on whether psychological dispositions are fixed or not. On this view, epistemic nudges are a bit like bubble wrap around a vase. Bubble wrap does not change the fragility of the vase; it only masks it. When epistemic nudges are not present and the bubble wrap removed, the vase remains as fragile as before.26 This leads Meehan to maintain that epistemic nudges are not only ineffective but counterproductive, insofar as they can lead to epistemic laziness. In response, Fratantonio's counterargument posits that repeated nudges can result in long-lasting effects for the epistemic agent, and contrary to Meehan's worry about laziness, nudges do not bypass or hinder one's capacities to reason and think critically. In conclusion, Fratantonio suggests that epistemic nudges might house some unexplored promise in educational contexts. The final article, \"Epistemic Vice Rehabilitation: Saints and Sinners Zetetic Exemplarism,\" by Gerry Dunne and Alkis Kotsonis, surveys a range of pedagogical possibilities for rehabilitating epistemic vices.27 Rather than individualistic expositions, where vice reduction lies at the feet of each individual, we look instead to an exemplarist animated community of inquiry principles based on defeasible-reasons-regulated processes. We argue that this approach epitomizes a more socially attuned, interdependently calibrated, true-to-life vice-reduction model. Our proposed model comprises four distinct yet complementary components: (1) positive exemplars of epistemic virtue (saints); (2) negative exemplars of epistemic vice (sinners); (3) direct teaching/instruction; and (4) cognitive apprenticeship. Positive exemplars give students role models to admire and emulate. Negative exemplars show how we are all human and that what is important about mistakes is that we learn from them and endeavor not to make them again. Direct teaching tackles epistemic vices head-on by means of using age and stage-appropriate stimuli (Tik Tok videos, Instagram videos, etc.) to unpack the deleterious effects of epistemic vice. Finally, cognitive apprenticeship uses the principles of modeling and expert-guided practice, where students learn via hands-on, real-world tasks to harness and enhance their inquiry processes, such as conceptual mapping, stress-testing reasons, anticipating objections, formulating alternative explanations, and scrutinizing the force of evidential claims. Together these papers offer a theoretical elaboration of the problem of epistemic vice, as well as specific pedagogical advice for educators on how to counteract them. Needless to say, this project is of special relevance today. A HUGE THANK YOU to the authors who worked tirelessly in putting together their papers for this symposium. Hopefully some of the scholarship here will act as a springboard for further research. A special word of thanks for accomplishing the above in such trying circumstances. I would also like to express my gratitude to all those who offered guidance and assistance during the various stages of this editorial process. Without your time, expertise, and considered feedback, none of this would have been possible. In particular, I would like to formally thank Nicholas Burbules, Ian James Kidd, and Neil Levy for their feedback on previous drafts. Finally, I would like to thank all the reviewers who so graciously read and carefully commented on the submissions published in this symposium.

      "abstract": "From the Publisher:\r\nPart 1.\r\n\r\nMastering Your Mental Barriers About Writing\r\n\r\nYour mind is your most powerful word processor. If it is not working clearly and efficiently, having a super-charged computer will not increase your work output at all. Your great technology will just enable you to produce bad writing more quicklyand in more fontsthan you could before. Effective writing depends on mindset, attitude, emotional state, expectations, and ability to cope with self-criticism. That is why we will begin with the issues that are usually the first ones to confront the writer: fear, loathing, and the overwhelming urge to do anything other than write.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this section addresses some broader issues that cause writers to stumble. These points appear here because they are part of the mindset that enables you to write more clearly.\r\n\r\nOvercoming your fear of writing\r\n\r\nCourage is resistance to fear, mastery of fearnot absence of fear.\r\nMark Twain\r\n\r\nIf fear, unconsciousness, and a compulsive urge to return phone calls, water plants, or eat cookies are preventing you from sitting down to write, you are not alone. In fact, the only people who never feel apprehensive about writing seem to be the ones who've had frontal lobotomies. These suggestions will help you relieve your fear of writingwithout having brain surgery.\r\n\r\n1. Take a few deep breaths.\r\n\r\nFear and anxiety cause the abdominal muscles to tense up, forcing the breath to become fast and shallow. This is a throwback to the happy days when our ancestors fled from saber-tooth tigers instead of writing deadlines. Neither fight nor flight areviable options anymore. We must bypass our primitive instincts and get some oxygen into our brains where it might help us think of something to write. Take a few really deep breaths. Slowly. Exhale completely and then inhale completely. You will feel calmerI promise.\r\n\r\n2. Weigh the costs and benefits.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself, What is the worst thing that could happen to me as a result of writing this? Sure, you could write the letter and then get fired or die, but how likely is that? As much as you may dread writing, odds are that the consequences of not writing will be far worse than the consequences of writing. That's a cheery thought, isn't it?\r\n\r\n3. Reward yourself after you've reached a certain point in the work.\r\n\r\nTake a or call someone you love or read the next chapter of a trashy novel. (Just make sure that your break doesn't eat up the rest of the you'd set aside for writing.) Don't wait until every last detail is done before you take a brief time-out. Interim incentives and interim rewards will help you nurse yourself through the project. You can still celebrate when the job is complete.\r\n\r\n4. Try to allow yourself enough time.\r\n\r\nTime pressure only adds to your anxiety. Whenever possible, create a schedule that will you finishing your project several days before the deadline. Then if you hit an unavoidable delay, you won't lose your mind.\r\n\r\n5. Schedule for writing every day.\r\n\r\nProfessional writers know that if they wait for the writing urge to strike, they might spend the rest of their lives at Starbucks. You cannot wait until you have time to sit down and write. You and I both know that there are always other things you could do. If you must finish a writing task, then reserve an hour or so in each day's schedule during which you will do nothing but write. Try to schedule your writing at the of day when you are most alert.\r\n\r\n6. Just do it!\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright 2001 by Elizabeth Danziger",

      "abstract": "Perhaps the reality that is hardest of all to accept in life is the unalterable fact that everything that is precious to us will, in some way, eventually be taken away. Our kids grow up and leave home, friends move away, loved ones die, we lose our health, and eventually we die too. Moreover even what is precious to us in terms of our faith and values suffers in the same way: things change, thoughts and feelings shift, rock foundations that once anchored us unassailably give way, doubt creeps in, the bottom falls out, and we are left wondering what we really believe in and what really can be trusted.",

      "abstract": "After being rejected for an insolvency arrangement, a mortgage holder is left in a difficult and precarious position. They are unwilling to give up and allow repossession, but they cannot recover. This is situated through Berlant's cruel optimism, where the object of our desire is ultimately harmful to our flourishing. Debtors remember the dream they had (see Chapter 3) of a good life, and it is this belief that they can recapture this vision of a good life which encourages them not to give up. Girard's concepts of mimesis, scapegoating, and sacrifice are used to explain how debtors engage in the coping process. They come to believe that there are dishonest debtors out there who are living the good life thanks to their dishonesty. Some of these debtors come to believe that some mortgagors must be sacrificed through eviction in order for the system to remain stable. Others become determined to resist neoliberal norms and begin to adopt a destructive and toxic attitude towards their creditors. For example, they often refuse to pay even though they are able, coming to willingly embody the creditor stereotype of the professional or reckless debtor.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We are wired for meaningful social connection—and live happier and healthier lives with enough of it. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that connection comes easily to us, especially in the modern world where we’re increasingly busy, distracted, and divided. The truth is that connection can be downright hard. This helps explain why millions of people around the world are lonely—or simply want more from their social lives. This book explains exactly why social connection can be so hard. Several key barriers to social connection are introduced, and evidence-based strategies for overcoming them are presented. Some of these barriers are clearly a function of modern life—such as being distracted by our devices, feeling overworked, and living far away from loved ones. Other barriers are more timeless, such as simply not knowing how to connect, misunderstanding the thoughts and feelings of others, undervaluing moments of solitude, and avoiding the sort of vulnerability that creates deep bonds. The book offers actionable, research-based strategies for overcoming the barriers and living a happier, more connected life.",

The next stage is for, a positive freedom that comes from embracing and creating something---a fulfilling relationship, for example, or an artistic or humanitarian vision. And lastly there is just the highest and ultimate freedom. This last freedom is more than being for or against something; it is the freedom of simply being oneself and responding truthfully to each moment.The Insights for a New Way of Living series aims to shine light on beliefs and attitudes that prevent individuals from being their true selves. The text is an artful mix of compassion and humor, and readers are encouraged to confront what they would most like to avoid, which in turn provides the key to true insight and power.Freedom helps readers to identify the obstacles to their freedom, both circumstantial and self-imposed, to choose their battles wisely, and to find the courage to be true to themselves.",

      "abstract": "In the level 2 state of assertiveness, we are tranquil, assertive, and powerful. Our voice is calm. Our face is neutral to soft. We are fair- minded and strong. Conflict is easily and efficiently resolved. Neither apologetic nor needlessly assertive, our frame of mind in this stage is to take care of the problem quickly and efficiently, so that there is no longer a problem. We neither shrink from nor plow our way through the situation. In level 2, we become adept at stating and displaying an ade­quate degree of assertiveness. Our actions in this level can be so adept that we hardly know there could have been a problem. The confidence that builds in level 2 becomes our norm, and potential conflicts dissolve with balanced and confident respon­siveness. Harsh retorts and meek acquiescence are mostly things of the past as we hone our internal and external responses to potential conflict. In the balanced state of level 2, our voice is matter- of- fact, moderate volume, non- threatening, and non- threatened. After much practice, this level becomes more of an automatic refram­ing and re- visioning of what is happening and what to do about it. Decisions that undergird responses in level 2 may be totally internal, when there is no need for a verbal or external response. Inwardly and outwardly, we feel in near perfect balance. The other’s behavior did not pull us out of our best self. It did not lure us into making a response that was unnecessary. • In response to a waiter bringing the wrong order: “You may have thought I said pasta, but I ordered salmon. What is the possibility that you could bring the salmon in the next ten minutes?” • In response to a noisy student interrupting another: “Allison, it is not your turn. Watch and listen to Meghan.” • In response to a very angry colleague, you choose not to get involved, and you watch the venting with detached observa­tion. Or you calmly leave the scene. Notice that responses in level 2 can carry with them a recommen­dation or suggestion for what to do next. These exchanges are handled with neutral, soft eyes.",

      "title": "Bereavement and Heightened Existential Awareness",
      "abstract": "\"Ask not for whom the bells toll; they toll for thee.\" John Donne's admonition, though written 350 years ago, endures with astonishing freshness; it speaks to something self-evident, to a truth that is well known to many who have experienced bereavement--that the death of a significant other has the potential to hurl the survivor into a confrontation with his/her own death. A confrontation with death--should we seek it? There is evidence in the clinical literature that in terminally ill patients such a confrontation may lead to pronounced positive psychological changes. Research (Yalom 1980) has documented that terminally ill patients may undergo a series of positive personal changes; they communicate more openly with family and close friends, they experience fewer fears, they rearrange their life priorities, they are less preoccupied with the trivialities of life, they live life more immediately rather than postpone experience and pleasure into the future. Does spousal bereavement in our culture confront individuals with their own personal death? Does it cause some widow/widowers to regard their existence in a different manner? If so, might it be possible that those bereaved individuals who examine their life deeply may have a different course of bereavement than those who do not look within? Might it even be possible that bereavement, for some individuals, results in psychological shifts analogous to the positive changes reported by terminally ill patients? These are the basic questions of our research inquiry. We designed a project which would allow us to determine, in a nonclinical sample of bereaved spouses, differences in the degree of existential awareness and the consequences of such awareness on the course of bereavement. We also attempted to determine which subjects were more likely to develop heightened existential awareness. The participants studied were part of an intervention project on bereavement in which we studied a sample of widows and widowers in the first few months of bereavement and then offered them an opportunity to participate in an eight-meeting support group. Reports of the clinical issues emerging in our short-term bereavement groups and of the efficacy of these groups were published elsewhere (Yalom and Vinogradov 1988; Lieberman and Yalom 1991).",

Such tactics make for good, television drama, but in the real world of spiritual growth they are often self-defeating and sometimes corrupt. Self-deception is a universal human phenomenon, inexorably linked with our capacity for self-reflective consciousness, and serving both good and bad purposes: that which can be known can also be denied, for various personal (and often private) reasons. It follows from the peculiar logic and complex psychology of 'lying to ourselves' that self-deceivers who are confronted, and whose lies are exposed, are often driven further into self-deception by such simplistic tactics. It also follows that those who choose to 'help' the self-deceiver run considerable risk of being self-deceived about their own motives and about the real effects of their help.",

This need to commune through speech is also enacted across distances (intimacy‐confirming phone calls, texts, emails to significant others, friends, family). Within small talk, what is talked about may matter less to participants than the interpersonal significance of talking at all – in a range of social contexts – from intimate, playful encounters (e.g. “pillow” talk) to formal, hierarchical gatherings (e.g., in breaking the ice at the beginning of a job interview).",

Sooner or later, the cause of these problems must be confronted. Flute playing is, or should be, a source of pleasure— for the listener, no doubt, but first of all for the flutist. “Charity well rendered starts with oneself.” It is not as selfish as it sounds. How can you help others when you cannot help yourself ? How can you bring enjoyment to your listeners when you hurt and suffer? How can you love anything when you hate yourself ? Practice is not so much a way to deal with our guilt feelings as a path to happiness and pleasure. This hedonistic philosophy might not be popular in the Puritan work ethic of “no pain, no gain.” However, pleasure in its deepest meaning requires sensitivity, patience, kindness, and self-knowledge, rather than greed.",

      "title": "IN THIS ISSUE (MAY 2006)",
      "abstract": "October 27, 2006. I sat in the impressive plenary room of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) headquarters in Rome during the final session of the World Congress on Communication for Development while participants raised their arms, more or less frantically trying to call the master of ceremony’s attention. In this very civilized manner, they struggled to be given the floor and have a chance to address the panel regarding the Congress’ recommendations. Some were lucky. Some were not. At that stage, the well-known device did not allow for much input. Staring at the FAO, World Bank and The Communication Initiative representatives situated atop of us, I couldn’t help thinking: are they listening? In his article “How can the global be local?” (2005) [1], social anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen states: “This is a world of impurities, grey zones, uncertainties and ambiguities, were the belief in progress is being replaced by ambivalence, where selfconfidence is replaced by anxiety, where trust is threatened by suspicion, and where the ability to listen has become a more important faculty than ever before in history”. How can we develop and nurture that faculty? How do we make ourselves better able to listen? How do we make ourselves heard? How do we give dialogue every possible chance? … Our sixth issue of Glocal Times is grounded in contributions from authors located in the Scandinavian region, many of them closely affiliated with Malmo University’s Master course in Communication for Development. With a common geographic locus, our guest contributors aim at the global scene. Rikke Andreasen takes us to Brazil, to present the collaborative work developed by the Danish art group Superflex with a group of farmers in Maues: the Guarana Project, a provocative experience in the realm of art for social change (make sure to check the video footage included in the article for a series of four commercials developed within the project). Kerstin Gosse takes us to Tanzania, to discuss the power of words in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the role of the media. Anders Hog Andersen takes us to Israel, to explore the boundaries and potential of an alternative education project aimed at addressing conflict between Jewish and Palestinian Arab youth. We thank Cecilia von Feilitzen, who on behalf of The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, a joint effort of UNESCO and the Swedish government based at the Nordic Information Centre for Media and Communication Research (NORDICOM), Goteborg University, Sweden, introduces us to media literacy. We also welcome Malmo University’s graduates from the Master course in Communication for Development. Maud Hell discusses the situation of school libraries in post-apartheid South Africa. Ann Jorneus Tenfalt makes a case for the implementation of community radio in development programmes based in her fieldwork in Uganda and Tanzania. Johanna Stenersen explores Kyrgyztan’s venturing into community-based tourism and its implications in terms of social identity. … Please contact us with your comments, questions and suggestions while we write down our experience of the Rome World Congress on Communication for Development (WCCD) and look into its immediate effects and outcomes[2]. A new issue of our webmagazine will be online early in 2007.

      "title": "TRIZ and Society: An Alternative Way of Winning Enemies Without Fighting",
      "abstract": "Although we are born and brought up in society, we are sometimes hurt by the offensive behavior of some people in our family and society, may be by the so-called friends or rivals or enemies. If we suppress our anger and don’t fight with them then we suffer from depression, frustration and other emotional disorders. On the other hand if we express our anger to fight back then the situation may become worse by inviting bigger fights and more violence. The question arises, how to solve this problem? There are both fighting solutions and non-fighting solutions to this problem. Non-fighting solutions are better than fighting solutions because they reduce anger and violence. They are not only good for individuals but also good for society and world. However, the drawback of non-fighting solutions is that generally, there is no feeling of our enemy getting punished. Although a higher ego (the rationality within us) is satisfied with such solutions, a lower ego (the animality within us) is not happy to see our enemy moving free or hurting us again. Ideally, we don’t want to set up a fight with anybody but we want to see our enemy is punished. We don’t want to kill our enemy by ourselves or by deploying others but we want to see that the enemy is dead. We don’t want to follow any method of violence but we want to see all our enemies dying before us. This article gives a solution to achieve this goal.",

For some he was, cold, remote, lacking emotional intelligence, mathematical, detached, unfriendly, pedantic, caustic and humourless; for others who managed to pierce his outer shell and come close to him he was warm, friendly, passionate, good humoured, caring and engaged. How could the same man elicit these entirely contradictory responses? There are some attributes that both his detractors and supporters generally appear to agree about: his honesty and integrity (sometimes taken to an extreme), fastidiousness, egalitarianism, industriousness and lack of motivation by material success. He could certainly be extremely direct, but he was canny enough to know when he should remain silent or when it was sensible to retreat. Indeed, the move to America was one such strategic withdrawal, when the odds were stacked against there being any benefit from remaining in Hungary and trying to work in defiance of the regime from within (or tacitly acquiescing with it). He, his family and his acquaintances would have certainly suffered if he had taken this approach, and he typically managed to find a subtle way of leaving his homeland without appearing to flee from it.",

      "title": "The Future ofW ork for Older Persons",
      "abstract": "Any serious discussion of the future must, first of all, avoid making predictions. In­ stead, we should discuss a range of possible alternative scenarios. Fortune-tellers, palm readers, astrologers, or gazers into crystal balls, are not welcome. Second, we should be clear about which future we refer to. Is it the very near future - for example, ten years from now? The intermediate future, about 20-25 years; or, the long-run future, say, 50 years from now? Each of these futures can be different from the others. But equally important, the dynamics, the characteristics, the trends set in one preceding time period impinges on those that follow. Each future is not a free­ standing time entity, independent of its predecessor, and without an effect on its suc­ cessors. But third, and the most significant of all propositions, is that our 0 primary responsibility - as public leaders and intellectuals - is to help develop goals, and then to work on the means and conditions for achieving those goals. We cannot talk about the future of work for older persons unless we debate and arrive at a con­ sensus about what roles or status we want to provide to older men and women human beings as young as 55, 60, or 70 and older. Where do we, as a society, institutions, and individuals want to be ten years from now? - 20 or 50 years from now? Even if we accept the possibility of large numbers of people in their 50s or early 60s no longer working, do we want that? I know that Ursula Lehr shares this philosophy with me. Do we have the actual and potential resources to make a reality of those goals, to assure that kind of society that we prefer? What needs to be done to utilize, find, or to create those resources? Such reasoning is a far cry from that type of futurism or futurology that tells us what the future society will look like; or what the work life of older men and women will be. I find it difficult to accept without question the many official and expert projections of the age-structure of the work forces of the future. Some futurists stipulate the conditions or assumptions underlying their predic­ tions; many of those conditions and assumptions themselves are not rigidly fixed, and some can be deliberately modified through public, private, and individual choices. But those choices must be made now, in the present. Although I am arguing here against the tendency to give a one-dimension projec­ tion of one and only one future, there is one possible exception. The exception is re­ lated to demography - to birth rates and death rates. There is very little flexibility or probability for dramatic changes in the population structure of any given society over the next 20-30 years. The probability is very high that Western societies, Japan, large parts of South America, and China, for example, will be experiencing relatively reduced fertility rates, and somewhat reduced mortality rates among adult popula­ tions groups. Because of high birth and fertility rates of several decades ago, the numbers of older persons also will generally increase in the near future.",

But what is commitement, and why should it matter? Is social commitment - for example, to the family - being eroded by individualism or ironic detachment? And how should we deal with the potential tension between devotion to a life-stance, and the doubts prompted by pursuit of rational integrity? In this work, Piers Benn delves into the relationship between commitment and meaningful life, and asks whether commitment must be based on truth to provide such meaning. He also explores obstacles to commitment such as boredom, sloth and indifference. Drawing on his own experience of dithering and procrastination, he suggests that a sceptical, cautious attitude to important matters can be both a virtue and a real obstacle to human fulfillment.",

Feelings are also connected with the way adolescents think. Some ways of thinking are helpful and make us feel good and others are unhelpful and make us feel unpleasant. When feelings persist and become very strong, adolescents might become depressed or have an anxiety problem. Some people are pessimistic, worry about what will happen and always look on the gloomy side of life. This way of thinking will make adolescents feel worried and sad and can drag adolescents down so that they become anxious or depressed.",

      "abstract": "“What a nasty thing to say!” But was it? “Her tantrums are so immature!” But are they? “He is just lazy and doesn’t care.” But is he? A momentary pause between our observation and our con­clusion about someone can make a world of difference. That moment of grace, in some ways, bestows a peace offering on someone who may or may not deserve it. It offers vitality and goodwill to the encounter. During that momentary internal pause, we have the opportu­nity to broaden our interpretation, to look beyond our immedi­ate response, to offer the benefit of the doubt. The “nasty thing to say” may be a misunderstood remark. Those “immature tan­trums” may be the result of severe emotional pain. That “lazi­ness” may be depression or disillusionment. Few of us would argue with someone giving us the benefit of the doubt. Most often we would welcome that generosity. Yet how do we offer a moment of grace without being gullible? When our intent is to suspend judgment momentarily, we are neither believing nor disbelieving. We simply postpone our con­clusions about another’s meaning and intention because we do not know the full story, and we know that we don’t know. We are comfortable sitting with our gesture of grace. Even though we may be taking this high road for the other, the benefits of grace ripple to us as well. Silent moments of grace serve both the giver and the receiver. Opportunities for grace are everywhere. A moment of grace is the interval of time we take to reframe somebody’s behavior so that we can react with curiosity, compassion, or openness rather than judgment, annoyance, or defensiveness. Giving someone the benefit of doubt allows us to delay our reaction to the comment or action with the intent of looking beyond our immediate response.",

      "title": "Editorial: A Friend in Need?",
      "abstract": "In recent months and years, each of us has experienced the deaths of friends. Among the many thoughts and feelings which these losses provoke, we have found ourselves reflecting on the nature of friendship. It is often said that we choose our friends whereas we cannot choose our family of birth and we do so for a number of reasons. Friends (at least, those we value) are people we enjoy being with, for the most part anyway; they are people with whom we feel a connection even if at first sight we may not appear to have much in common; they are often people with whom we share interests; they are people who will help us out when we have a problem and to whom we expect to be able to turn in times of real trouble; above all, good friends are people whom we trust—and this may be the ultimate test of the strength of a friendship. These qualities may be present in a relatively new but intensively pursued friendship or with someone we have known for a long time but now see infrequently; some people like to refer to their ‘oldest friend’. Friendship in the modern world has taken a number of different turns, however. As families come in all shapes and sizes, so also, in certain lifestyles, friends are ‘like family’ or indeed closer. There can be no greater test of friendship than when a friend gives themselves to being with and caring for a friend at the end of life. In our intimate relationships, we increasingly hear one partner refer to the other as ‘my best friend’. Yet the term proliferates in social media to identify a quite different relationship, including the ability to ‘unfriend’ someone at the click of a mouse. Interestingly, we recently published an article in the BritishJournal ofSocialWork which found that, at the end of the day, it was the traditional friendships pursued offline by which young people set the most store (Sen, 2016).",

This stress can easily start habits like obsessive worrying or constant shallow breathing, both of which are hard to break and have little benefit. The goal is to encourage a daily art practice and to reframe art-making as, rather than a far-off, sacred but unattainable dream, an activity of everyday life that is so common that it becomes \"nothing special.\" When an artist cannot find enough peace of mind to practice her craft in a particular place, she suffers a loss of an inner homecoming.

      "abstract": "People come to therapy with stories about themselves that are in some way interfering with the lives they would prefer to lead. Yet problematic stories will only ever be one version of lived experience, a partial description of a person's identity and the events within their lives. Re-authoring is the process by which people are supported to develop alternative accounts of themselves: accounts that they prefer. The therapist does this by listening out for those hopeful moments that may have become neglected or overshadowed by the problem story. Narrative theory suggests that these moments can be richly described; the richer their description, the greater their possibility for influence (White, 2007). This being so, as stories become more vivid and visible to a person, they also become easier to access and metaphorically step into. Thus in order to thicken a developing story, meaning is deepened and moments connected to others within a person's history. Encouraging a re-engagement with stories that have been hidden from view offers the possibility for the resurrection of alternative knowledge, skills, values, hopes, and dreams. This can lead to the development of new (or even old) understandings that fit better with the way a person would like to see themselves, be seen by others, or go on in life.",

      "title": "Public and Private I: Walter Scott and the Anxiety of Authorship",
      "abstract": "PUBLIC AND PRIVATE I: WALTER SCOTT AND THE ANXIETY OF AUTHORSHIP MARILYN ORR Laurentian University In ethnographic societies the responsibility for anarrative is never assumed by a person but by a mediator, shaman or relator whose “performance”— the mastery of the narrative code — may possibly be admired but never his “genius.” (Roland Barthes, “The Death of the Author” 68) In private diaries ... we come several steps nearer to the reality of a man’s sentiments. ... It is no doubt certain that in this species of self­ intercourse we put many tricks upon our actual and our moral self, and often endeavour to dress deeds, enacted by the former on very egotistical principles, in such a garb as may in some degree place them favourably before the other’s contemplation. Still there must be more fair dealing betwixt ourself and our conscience, than ourself and any one else; — here there is much which can neither be denied or extenuated; Magna est veritas et prevalebit. (Walter Scott, Review of Pepys’s Diary, Prose Works 20: 97) W hen in the 1838 essay that would sum up the Victorian response to Walter Scott, Thomas Carlyle declared with characteristic flourishthat Scott was far too healthy to be a great man,1 one certainly knows what he meant. A writer who can conjure up a meeting of Waverley novel stockholders to deal with the emergence of impostors and to debate the merits of using a novel-writing machine to save their novelist’s wrist from overuse is definitely not a serious writer.2 Instead, Scott actually provides Carlyle with the very terms for Scott’s own incrimination: he is, just as Carlyle charges, in business, and in the business of the “manufacture,” not the “creation” of novels (Carlyle 369). Such a pragmatist is indeed too insistently healthy even to recognize the disease of Carlyle’s age, let alone administer a cure; he is too unselfconscious even to know there is a depth below the surface on which he skates (357). Well, no. In fact, Scott was so aware of himself as a writer and of the precariousness of health that he created a whole community of personae to act out the fantasies of egotism and obsession that were for him the attendant shadows of fiction-making. The self-creations begin with his very first novel, which he presents to the public under the dual covering of a title English Studies in Canada, 2 2 , 1 ,March 199 6 page that is free both of “preconceived associations” and of an identified author. Claiming modesty, he comes forth “like a maiden knight with his white shield” that bears the imageofa hero with “an uncontaminated name” (1.1.3).3 The images of maiden purity and innocence suggest one reason for the knight’sdiffidence, in that in 1814writing novels was a decidedly dubious enterprise that aligned male writers with women and assigned to female writers contaminating influences.4 In this climate anonymity provided the necessary shield against public ridicule and censure. But what the virgin knight is really defending himself against is not the enemy without but the enemy within—the dragon of the ego. The ingenious lengths to which the knight goes to ensure that someone else is held responsible for the twenty novels that are produced over the next ten years are unsurpassed. The Author maintains his anonymity by enlisting the aid of an opinionated and often warring group of storytellers, writers, editors, and antiquarians, not to mention such ploys as the found manuscript and the appearance ofhis own spirit. Outspoken and often specious and out­ rageous arguments over such narrative issues as the authenticity ofthe text, the reliability ofthe teller, and the relative truth-value offiction and history serve, ironically, to establish the credentials of the Author’s sources. These postmodernish tactics demonstrate Scott’s playfulness in the face ofthe seri­ ous game of authorship as well as his need for a basis for authorial authority other than himself. More important, these narratorial displacements also suggest that the problem of authorship is for Scott rooted in the problem of the narrator: at the root of his obsession with authorial impersonation is a deep-seated distrust...",

      "title": "Stripping the Memoir",
      "abstract": "Late at night when I can't sleep, I think about stories: why certain memoirists pull me close, surrendering a life's worth of certainty and confusion while others tell me a story that seems too familiar, too predictable, a linear tagging of traumatic events. What I've come to see is that it's not merely a case of subject matter, but a ques tion of the intimacy and judgment that accompanies self-revelation. Intimacy is the most difficult act of creation in the memoir because it depends on a narrative honesty that balances on the razor's edge of self-knowledge. The lure in the memoir isn't: open your life to me, but something more difficult: create a melody of your contradictions. Contradiction is at the heart of confession. Look, for example, at the narrator of Kathryn Harrison's The Kiss: the narrator desires merger with the father and, in equal measure, longs for release from his grip; she desires heightened visibility while simultaneously seeking annihilation. The book itself is a fever of contradictory pur poses, beginning with the father's megalomaniac need to consume the daughter and the daughter's desire to be needed and loved for herself. The story, a long unraveling of the transgression initiated by the kiss, demands a retrospective gaze back to childhood, to the mother, to the place where the mother refuses consciousness of me: I do not exist. The grip of the story is whether the daughter can save herself after her fall from grace into the landscape of self-loathing and moral despair. In another memoir, Carolyn Slaughter's Before the Knife, the nar rator seeks release from the seething violence of her colonialist family in British-ruled Botswana and simultaneously longs only to fit into the orbit of her mother, even as that mother retreats behind her mosquito net. For the narrator, violence (to self, to others, from others) alternates with the need for beauty, for the solace of wilder ness and the more pagan life of instinct which the bush demands. Without the pleasures of the bush, the daughter is lost to the cru elty and violence of the father and the neglect and passivity of the mother. Although the story relates the last days of colonialist rule in Africa, Before the Knife takes its narrative landscape from perverted",

Taking the U.S. as an example, this word is now a symbol of the will to overcome hurdles or disabilities. The blind, the deaf and dumb, the paraplegic, the quadriplegic and what have you, do not wish to be pitied; they prefer to be simply known as the challenged. They reject anything that suggests they are helpless and incapable of participating fully in life’s activities. Hence, terms like: the visually challenged, the physically challenged, etc. have become very common. In most cases, their effort to live up to that term is quite conspicuous. One cannot but be struck that in the West, for every single problem there are several minds who, without consulting each other, are simultaneously working hard, thinking and researching, in an endeavour to solve or at least minimise that problem for everybody. The 21 century is likely to present even stiffer challenges that will push further the limits of scientific research.",

OrientationsChapter I -page 4 Chapter I. Orientations 2When professionals from different organizations come together, they bring diverse perspectives, abilities, identities, interests, etc.: One team member might be an expert in technologies while another takes a more business-oriented perspective, one might just have begun working for a start-up while another has been part of her large organization for years, and one might pursue a personal agenda while another is seeking to maximize her organization's pay-offs.Interorganizational teams are often ripe with such distinctions, which is another way of saying that many different voices become expressed in them (Gray & Schruijer, 2010).This dissertation asks two overarching questions: First, what differences make a difference-whose voices do we hear-in interorganizational collaboration?Second, how do these voices shape and constitute how work unfolds and organizing is accomplished?",

      "abstract": "Old Man. But there are some That do not care what's gone, what's left: The souls in Purgatory that come back To habitations and familiar spots. Boy. Your wits are out again. Old Man. Re-live Their and that not once But many times; they know last The of Whether upon others or upon themselves; Upon others, others may bring help, For when is an The dream must end; if upon themselves, There is no help but in themselves And in mercy of God. (1) I INTRODUCTION The accumulated texts that supply working materials of constitutional law are not only written records of responses to problems of government organization and claims concerning rights of individuals. They are also an archive, an accessible collective memory, means for readers (persons who choose to read later as well as writers in process of writing) to re-experience controversies and their conclusions, to consider and to accept, reject, or revise explanations for conclusions, and to become, in process, more or less participants (more or less complicit) in controversies and conclusions. If constitutional law is therefore a version of purgatory and not hell, it may be because its readers and writers are able to imagine a terminus, an to [t]he consequences of those transgressions in which they are implicated. Korematsu as Justice Black wrote it seems to have supposed a short stay indeed: whatever wrong this decision did would be undone in Ex Parte Endo only a few pages further in United States Reports. (2) If Justice Black was wrong, if neither he nor his readers are as yet purged of Korematsu's transgressions, if Endo is not absolution (Jerry Kang's freighted term), (3) it may be because the consequence of Korematsu for persons who were forcibly evacuated into concentration camps could not be declared at end in 1944 and cannot even now. Perhaps Endo did not--could not--accomplish what Black seemed to have hoped it would. Perhaps the consequence fell also upon Justice Black himself and now falls upon his readers. Reading Endo always requires remembering Korematsu, just as reading Korematsu always sets stage for reading Endo. There is no (it would have seemed to Yeats). Korematsu and Endo are not, however, only pertinent texts. (4) This Article begins by sketching something of content of The Spoilage, one of two principal publications issued after an ambitious contemporary study of what its organizers called American Evacuation and Resettlement, undertaken by University of California social scientists and funded by Columbia, Giannini, and Rockefeller Foundations? The Spoilage is a complex and controversial record of efforts of camp residents, chiefly Tule Lake, to identify and put to use effective forms of political action notwithstanding resistance of camp administrators, sometimes dramatic and sometimes confoundingly passive. (6) These political efforts conclude--in The Spoilage least--with mass renunciation of American citizenship by thousands of Tule Lake residents after Endo issued and after announcement of dosing of camps. (7) The legal aftereffects of this renunciation and The Spoilage account of it soon became subjects of decisions by United States Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, in Acheson v. Murakami (8) and its implementing successor McGrath v. Abo. (9) In many ways remarkable if today largely forgotten, Murakami and Abo substantially blocked official enforcement of Tule Lake renunciations. These decisions and their constitutional context are explored some length in this Article--like Endo, along with Korematsu, confronting and testing readers and writers caught in constitutional purgatory. Chief Judge Denman's opinions in Murakami and Abo, it will become dear, may be grouped with Justice Douglas's effort in Endo and Judge Goodman's decision in Kuwabara (10) blocking draft resistance prosecutions of Japanese American internees. …",

But the dual compulsion to depart and return, which afflicts many amongst those who believed in the reality of a new life abroad, can lead to the possibility of a more complex stability. Though not straight away. First there is the need to cope with disappointment and the progressive realisation that one does not really advance in the knowledge of the host-culture. Received ideas do not travel well and the illusion of a second beginning barely survives the shock of landing in the alien land. Instead, an unavoidable reticence to accept the hospitality of foreignness makes you veer slowly into quasi-simultaneous states of extreme numbness and extreme receptivity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We all accept the idea that emotions are reactions to matters of apparent importance to us: fear to danger, surprise to the unexpected, outrage to insult, disgust to what will make us sick, envy of the more favored, gratitude for benefactors, hate for enemies, love for friends, and so on. And sometimes the felt emotion can precede knowledge of precisely what the danger, the insult, the nauseating substance, and so on is. Emotion then plays the role of alerting us to something important to us—a danger, or an insult. As I write this chapter, a young man on trial for stabbing his mother to death in the family home (just down the road from where I live), whose defense is insanity, claims memory loss for the time of the murder but says he knows he must have done it, since, quite apart from the over-whelming physical evidence, he has “the guilty sort of feeling, like I have done something” (Otago Daily Times, Aug. 29, 2001). This is a rare and doubtless pathological case, but emotions can on occasion play the role of showing us that something important has occurred before we clearly understand what exactly it is.",

When you respond to the cries and ease the distress, babies begin to associate you with feeling comfortable. They rely on you to come when they cry. Gradually they begin to love and trust you. Once babies feel secure, it is easier for them to say “goodbye” when parents leave for an hour or a day. Some parents think that responding to babies every time they cry will spoil them. Quite the opposite is true. Research shows that when parents respond quickly and consistently to cries during the first months, babies cry less often and for less time later on. Babies who have been ignored and their cries not responded to are the very ones who fuss and cry a good deal and are difficult to control.",

Life is full of many things bright and beautiful and things that bring us challenges and difficulties. Many of our experiences—both the wonderful and the hard—come to us simply because they are part of this earth life. Some things that we experience are brought upon us by others. These can be blessings we receive through no effort of our own, or challenges inflicted when we have no choice in the matter. And some of our experiences are of our own making as we use our agency. All of our experiences, both the positive and the negative, if used wisely, can bring us closer to Heavenly Father in this life and closer to an eternal relationship with Him. All of them are part of His plan of happiness. Basically, this means that as we partake of the good things life has to offer, we can find great joy and fulfillment. It also means that as we have to face the hard things, we have choices to make. We can choose to turn away from the Father in fear, anger, weariness, bitterness, rebellion, or discouragement, or we can choose to embrace all of what life brings with a determination to stay close to our Father in Heaven. We can choose to be strong as we endure and trust in His love and in His Atonement. We can choose to follow Him in faith.",

Y es posiblemente una instancia o demanda en la mayoria de los casos abandonada y/o no sentida como propia.

Saber de los limites e infinitos que portamos y no son para nada materia academica regular. Ni nada que se le parezca; al menos hasta ahora, no se tiene como algo que de ordinario se pueda aprender y profundizar en las aulas. Y ello es saber de nuestras debilidades y de nuestras potencialidades individuales inicialmente; para llegar y profundizar hasta donde y hasta que, podriamos estar dispuestos a hacer, recorrer y apostar, para lograr y alcanzar nuestros deseos mas intimos y significativos, anhelos y, por que no, despues poder ahondar en las regiones en las que es posible disipar y controlar los miedos y otros fantasmas que nos acechan; tanto a lo interno como en externalidad ordinaria.Es que sabemos tan poco de nosotros mismos.

Knowledge about our limits and potentials are not really part of our academic formation, or at least it is correct to say that is not something that is normally discussed or learned in the classroom. We need to learn our strengths and weaknesses in order to know how much we are willing to commit to achieving our most intimate and significant aspirations and, subsequently, explore regions where it is possible to mitigate and control our fears, generated from both internal and externalsources.We know little about ourselves, or how to describe and investigate this deeply personal world.

      "abstract": "Figure“Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.”Mark Twain Do you think of yourself as the Cowardly Lion when you're faced with difficult issues? If so, you aren't alone. Experiencing fear doesn't mean you can't be brave—a lesson all of us should take seriously. It's our responsibility as leaders to act courageously. We frequently hear that having moral courage is an important part of our practice. This basically means that we speak up and act for what's important to us, for what's right. The organizational values that are posted on message boards and dangling from your ID badge are meant to be more than wallpaper. Be clear about your values. At times these values are in conflict with organizational direction. Excessive punishment for mistakes, staffing levels that don't meet patient needs, lack of transparency, and tolerance of disrespect are just some examples of the issues that can fuel moral distress among staff and managers. We may even experience situations that defy true patient-centeredness. It's an awful feeling. Sometimes it's easier not to make a decision, stay silent on an issue, or even let our team be unduly criticized. Although it seems neutral at the time, the effects of inaction are often negative. Yes, fear can be paralyzing if you let it. Your staff members look to you to provide the moral compass and advocate for them and their patients. You may regret hesitating to act for what's right. However, we aren't always faced with a clear “right” versus “wrong.” Both are relatively dynamic terms that can be defined by the situation and individuals involved. It helps to use a systematic process to understand and clarify issues, including any important hurdles in the way of acting bravely. It's up to us to get help along the way and to help each other. Fear is normal! We can all use encouragement and guidance in this respect. There are resources out there to assist in managing fear and being true to our values. We teach our staff members the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's well-known TeamSTEPPS communication strategies to improve their confidence in dealing with tough issues at the bedside. We can and must use the same techniques, as well as others, to tackle difficult management concerns. Our support systems help prevent us from acting brashly or “crying wolf,” which may result in lost credibility—something to avoid—although we also learn lessons from initial disappointments. There's no shame in it. Celebrate courage. The OR staff nurse who “stops the line” when there's a discrepancy in laterality. The med-surg charge nurse who makes an assignment contrary to normal unit practice to meet patient needs and who stands up to the protesters. The manager who advocates for needed resources when his or her team is stretched to the limit. The director who doesn't settle for “we've always done it this way.” The CNO who speaks up for nurses practicing at the top of their license. You know it when you see it and have that “right on, go for it” feeling. I wrote about leaving your comfort zone last summer. Being courageous may feel that way to you and, if so, I urge you to develop your comfort with courage. The Cowardly Lion did it and we can, too. It's a moral imperative for nurse leaders who are striving for greatness.Figure[email protected]",

      "title": "Keep the Change",
      "abstract": "At a recent meeting someone who was promoting a minimally invasive technique was quoting “If you are doing the same thing you did many years ago, it means that you have not made any progress.” You are not moving into the 21st century. The implication is that you are not making any attempts to be better; you are not keeping up with innovations or you are not applying the innovations in other fields to advance your own field. In short, if you are not changing what you do, you may not be the best you can be. You may be in that comfort zone and not challenging yourself or pushing the boundaries. The flip side to keep changing is that you don’t want to argue with the success you have with status-quo; changing just for the sake of changing is foolhardy. Don’t rush where angels tread. Let others take the risk and determine if the change is safe and it is for the better. Humans are creative. Creativity will not change and human nature in general is to seek or push for change, as there is always that room to improve. Not all changes are successful or immediately successful, but the attempts can help push the envelope in the direction we seek to go. Change can paradoxically take you back many years, such as when you come to realize the benefits of using reusable shopping bags instead of disposable plastic bags; or going back to drinking tap water instead of bottled water. We have seen this with current renaissance in hallux valgus correction. Metatarso-cuneiform fusion advocated by Paul Lapidus many years ago for hallux valgus correction seems to be re-emerging but with a twist and with helpful innovations in other fields. The use of cutting guides which were not available in his era certainly makes this difficult operation less challenging technically and more reproducible and is taking us back to a technique that was advocated many years ago. Here change has helped resurgence of an old technique. Change is a reality. Something that will not change, is change itself! We are grateful to have Dr Victor Valderrabano serve as the Guest Editor for this issue. In his long career, his creativity has brought innovative changes to this field. You will find other innovators and authorities who look for that room for improvement and strive to keep the change. Vinod K. Panchbhavi, MD, FACS, FAOA, FABOS, FAAOS",

      "abstract": "In the history of psychoanalytical thought, anxiety is described as a form of fear that lacks an object of reference. Anxious individuals live in a condition of free-floating danger, always acting as though their actions could trigger apocalyptic scenarios, but never capable of describing the source of their affliction. Anxiety is fear that cannot be pinned downed, an all-pervasive and all-encompassing fear that has removed itself so far away from any specific object (see introduction) to the point of becoming unfathomable. As a general condition of indiscriminate fear, anxiety leaves people breathing heavily and experiencing palpitations without any apparent danger, paralyses them by the sight of different patterns on the pavement, makes them afraid of walking into shops. In the post-11 September World, where individuals are supposed “to say something if they see something” this condition of free-floating fear has been turned on its head, challenged against the signs of anxiety themselves: we start to breath heavily and experience palpitations by the sight of others breathing heavily and experiencing palpitations, although no objective event or reason has trigger this “hysterical” cycle.

Almost all characters in his earlier novels and short stories were lost and sought escape from striving against existential destiny adopting the self-destroying style of life. In these novels and short stories, the author uses symbols and images to establish the dominant mood of lostness and nothingness. All images, references, or symbols have been associated with the dominant mood of failure, emptiness, despair, and defeat. Rain has been presented as a symbol of disaster. The images of plains make Frederic Henry more aware of war and death. Frequent references to dancing parties, sex or drink mark their ‘bad faith’ or fleeing away from their freedom or reality.

      "abstract": "Abstract Before you emotionally react to, or evaluate, something, you need to pay attention to it. It needs to matter. Beginning with infants’ interactions with their caretakers, humans create shared realities with each other about what matters, what is relevant and irrelevant. It is basic to how humans connect to one another, to how they become a member of their family and their culture. It is how we learn what sound patterns (phonemes) matter in our language community. Once we pay attention to something, we also learn shared realities of how to evaluate it, whether to like or dislike it, approach it or avoid it. And it is not just the valence of things. We learn the intensity as well—how much to like it or how much to dislike it. Our shared realities with others even influence what kind of positive emotional reaction we have to something or what kind of negative reaction. When you succeed at something, do you feel happy or at ease? When you fail, do you feel sad or nervous? How you feel depends on the shared realities you have developed with others about what kind of world you live in—a world of gain and nongains or a world of losses and nonlosses. And the emotional world that you shared with a significant other can be transferred to a new person who simply resembles that significant other in some way. In these and other ways, our shared realities with others profoundly affect our life experiences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

Contrary to the Freudian view of innate self-destructive tendencies, there is scant evidence that normal people ever seek harm or failure for themselves. They do however make self-destructive trade-offs, typically seeking a positive immediate reward that happens to come with a serious but delayed cost. Another pathway into self-defeat is that faulty knowledge about self and world causes people to pursue good outcomes in ways that backfire and thwart their efforts. Self-defeating actions occur in connection with threats to reputation, emotional distress, and failures of self-control. Free will is generally used to bring benefits to the self, but sometimes people go about this in ways that end up hurting themselves.",

      "title": "Faith Within Atheism",
      "abstract": "Things have a way of working out for the best. Whenever I have experienced loss, I have found that I have been able to change my viewpoint to adapt to my new condition. In this way, I have been able to cope with having schizophrenia. Because I believe that this adaptation happens naturally, realizing that this process is natural demonstrates to me that I am living within the framework of something bigger than myself: that a form of faith is possible and has allowed me to experience a meditative calm. In this way, I believe that faith is a state of being.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to an idea that I had when I was a child: that the important thing in life is to live in the most adaptive way possible. In other words, the best philosophy is the one that produces the best results. In essence, this is what I think we are all attempting to do, that we are all doing our best given our circumstances. However, I do believe we have a choice. Without working through our problems, it is easy to turn to the path of least resistance. For instance, putting all of one’s hopes and efforts into a false panacea, be it a religion, a partner, or a drug. This is to my mind the path of least resistance, of least understanding. However, by putting in the effort, I believe that we have the potential to gain insight and, in so doing, realize peace.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when I developed schizophrenia, I soon realized that if I did nothing, I would fall into a downward spiral. Let me explain what this means. During my psychotic break, I lost the chance to enter graduate school at the doctoral level and chose instead to work with a master’s in psychology. In other words, I settled for less in order to receive a measure of safety. With the stress of graduate school, I risked another psychotic break, and to risk that was to risk my life. The downward spiral, in my view, is this continual settling for safety at the expense of a more prominent position in life. The choice of risk and safety is a delicate balance, and ultimately I chose safety—in other words, life. Having done so though, I have gained much more: personal growth through acceptance.\r\n\r\nChoosing life has influenced and altered my life philosophy. I have moved from a position as a strict atheist to a viewpoint of faith within atheism. I have seen that a good life exists beyond ambition and pure reason. My life has now settled into an alternative place. I now have a job as a social worker. Although somewhat different than my field of study of clinical psychology, I love the work and the chance to make a difference. Arriving here took my realization that life deserves effort. I realized that an important part of my job was to make sure I stayed well. To do so, I altered my diet and lifestyle. I began eating more fruits and vegetables, cutting unnecessary fats and sugars from my diet, and practicing yoga. More importantly, I began to monitor my stress level, in particular the hidden stress that comes from positive changes in my life, such as being accepted into graduate school or presenting my master’s thesis at the American Psychological Association’s national convention. This positive stress, so-called eustress, in my opinion, has been the source of my descent into psychosis both times. Since my most recent psychotic episode, I have experienced minor residual symptoms, in the form of believing that others are speaking disparagingly of me. This is a mixture of the paranoia and referential thinking that lies within the symptom range of schizophrenia. The experience is undeniably unpleasant, but I am able to deal with it by confronting my own thoughts when they occur to me. I tell myself, “my mind is playing tricks on me,” or “this is a symptom, not reality.” When I still have confusion, I confide in a close friend or family member to bring me back to reality. In essence, I am using my psychological training to be my own therapist.\r\n\r\nMoreover, my experiences have shown me that not everything I have seen has been delusional. An important piece of the puzzle for me was to understand how it is possible to live with self-respect after the experience of psychosis. Psychosis is an altogether different state of being. It is a state in which connections are seen between all things and where it is possible to see existence as a great interconnected tapestry that works in perfect harmony. Even now that I no longer can see this tapestry at the same level of vibrancy as during my psychotic breaks, I find that I cannot deny this as entirely delusional. In my view, this tapestry of multiple patterns working in harmony has been demonstrated through the cold lens of science, and my experience of “seeing” this tapestry in delusion has demonstrated unequivocally to me the existence of God’s handiwork in detailed clarity. This experience has led me to rethink the Christian faith that I grew up with.\r\n\r\nJoan of Arc has proven the perfect role model for how to live with faith as a schizophrenic patient. Even though her experiences were admittedly delusional, her life has demonstrated the power of faith. Although others, even during her own life, did not believe in what she had seen, she still had been able to arrive at a state of being in which she exercised a profound effect on others. I have taken the lessons of her life and applied them to my own, to live an inspiring life upholding belief and the spirit and to live for a cause other than purely one’s own self-interest. In this sense, I have become what might be called an atheist with faith. For me, if God exists, he is unknowable, except through his work. In other words, the intricate balance of the tapestry of existence, where I am but one small thread. Moreover, I am an atheist by natural disposition. I do not believe in fairy stories that cannot be proven. The lens I see through works primarily through empiricism and reason. The main difference between me and a strict atheist is that my reason has been colored by my undeniable experiences of psychosis. That is, I have seen the evidence of God as metaphor in amazing vibrancy.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have seen my place in this world is to create a more beautiful tapestry, in other words, to influence my surroundings for the better, in the best way that I am able. I have come to the conclusion that the best way to do so is to live for the spirit, for belief. Living in this way has enabled me to obtain acceptance of my condition, reaching a more serene plane of existence. Whether this serenity is “truth” to me is besides the point. The point for me is to better my life and my world. Quoting the notable philosopher Albert Camus, “One must believe, not that God exists, but in God.”1\r\n\r\nThe cold truth is that I have lived against the odds. I have survived 2 suicide attempts during 2 distinct psychotic episodes. I have come to realize that our lives are precious and that life deserves our full effort and participation. We owe the world our efforts. I realize that my experiences are not within the normal range, but nevertheless, I believe that it is too easy for others to dismiss my new philosophy as nothing more than a simple coping mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn reality, none of us have chosen our life experiences, but it is also true that given the situation that I was born into, I have chosen my own path, I have chosen life, and I have chosen faith. This is what separates those with schizophrenia from others, the possession of a faith that is immutable to reason, which has been proven to us by our own lived experience. To deny our faith is to deny who we are. As the fictionalized Joan of Arc said in the film le Passion de Jeanne d’Arc, “One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying.”2\r\n\r\nThe important distinction is how to choose what to believe and what not to. When one discovers how to live a life devoted to staying well, one discovers a peacefulness to life and serenity that once discovered is glaringly obvious, yet each path to that state is unique to each person. This has been my path, the way of faith within atheism.",

Knowing that their death will preclude them from protecting or promoting such projects people who draw meaning from them will often attempt to secure their continuance by securing promises from others to serve as their caretakers after they die. But those who rely on such are faced with a problem: None of the four major accounts that have been developed to explain directed promissory obligation (the Authority View, the Trust View, the Assurance View, and the Reliance View) support the view that we are obligated to keep our promises to persons who are now dead. But I will provide hope for those who wish to use such promises to protect the meaning with which they have endowed their lives. I will argue that while we cannot wrong a person who is now dead by breaking a promise made to her during her life, we could wrong the living by so doing. We thus (might) have reason to keep the promises that we made to those who are now dead.",

I never felt inclined to accept reality as it was, even when it was still impossible for me to understand the roots of my family's difficulties. I never thought that life was predetermined or that the best thing to do was to accept obstacles as they appeared. On the contrary, even in my very early years I had begun to think that the world needed to be changed; that something wrong with the world could not and should not continue. Perhaps I wanted the world to change because of the negative context in which my family lived. Finding myself immersed in predicaments that did not affect the children around me, I learned to compare my situation with theirs. This led me to conclude that the world needed to be corrected.",

      "title": "A Psychoanalytic Study of Migration: Its Normal and Pathological Aspects",
      "abstract": "Without maintaining that it always follows the same steps, we could say that the migratory process passes through several phases. The feelings that prevail are those of intense sorrow for all that has been abandoned or lost, fear of the unknown, and the very profound experiences of loneliness, privation, and helplessness. Paranoid, confusional, and depressive anxieties occupy the scene in turn. This stage may be followed or replaced by a manic state in which the immigrant minimizes the transcendental significance of the change in his life or, on the contrary, magnifies the advantages of the change and overvalues everything in the new situation, disdaining what has been lost. After a variable period of time, nostalgia appears, and sorrow for the lost world. The immigrant begins to recognize feelings previously dissociated or denied and becomes capable of \"suffering\" his pain (\"growing pains\") while, at the same time, he becomes more accessible to the slow and progressive incorporation of elements of the new culture. The interaction between his internal and external world becomes more fluid. Recovery of the pleasure of thinking and desiring and of the capacity for making plans for the future, in which the past is regarded as such and not as a \"lost paradise\" where one constantly longs to return. In this period, it could be considered that mourning for the country of origin has been worked through to the maximum extent possible, facilitating integration of the previous culture into the new culture, without the need to renounce the old. All of this promotes an enrichment of the ego and the consolidation of a more evolved sense of identity.",

When we are placed in situations in which we are powerless and unable to influence events, we become victims.

Indeed, very serious psychological repercussions can result in individuals who have been exposed to trauma which stems from displacement from home, death of loved ones, loss of community, and an inability to predict the future with any degree of certainty.",

How would it change the way we view temptation if we acted like the most rational and logical thing was to go to God in prayer totally depending on Him rather than leaning on our own understanding? Every temptation is an opportunity to trust God or trust only in ourselves. Prayer is a weapon that God designed to fight temptation.",

Death of personality, of memory, and of physical skills wears away the fabric of relationships, leaving little hope of any return to normalcy. To some, this reflection exhibits how faith sustains hope and comforts those afflicted, despite the odds of inevitable loss. To others it reflects upon the poignant complexities associated with palliative care and the demand for individualized attention to the beliefs, norms, and values of each situation, no matter the culture, religion, age, or race. No two cases are ever the same in the face of death, yet for those who experience it, all must appreciate how difficult, unique, personal, and memorable such moments can be.",

      "abstract": "Have you ever been in a situation where you have asked yourself whether you should tell on a person because he or she is not doing the right thing? An example of this might be that you see someone on the school grounds pulling a branch from a tree and that person then tries to hit other children with the branch when they pass by. In your mind, you might start thinking about what might happen if you speak up. Will you get in trouble? Will the person you told on be angry with you? Will someone get hurt if you do not say anything? When faced with such decisions, it is important to understand the difference between telling on someone and telling someone. When we tell on someone (also called dobbing or snitching), we are trying to get someone in trouble on purpose. Telling someone is different, as we are speaking up because we are worried that something bad might happen or someone might get hurt. Our brains help us make decisions based on our past experiences and current thoughts … but sometimes parts of the brain can make this process even more confusing.",

      "abstract": "As in this era, every person is so distracted by a wide variety of things from this world, it is incredibly challenging for them to discover a way that leads them closer to realizing that God exists. This is an undeniable reality. One of the numerous things that will prevent him from achieving his objective is the fact that he does not have a long-term perspective. Someone who has gone before him must come to his aid, take him by the hand, and safely guide him through the intractable traps and pitfalls of worldly temptation and wants in order for him to reach his goal—the end of his suffering and the fulfillment of his quest. This is the only way for him to achieve his objective, which is the end of his suffering and the completion of his quest. This revelation is simply recognizing that oneself to be the one and only Self that does not change. A person is doomed to end up in a fool's paradise if they put on the second orange garment and start down the path of renunciation without first emptying the Augean stables of their mind through acts of selfless and disinterested service while immersed in the toil and moil of the world. This is the only way to purge the Augean stables of their mind. Therefore, in order to get ready for the impending great battle royal and ultimately emerge victorious, one must first and foremost practice Karma Yoga in a relentless and unceasing manner, acquiring all noble qualities such as cosmic love, persistence, nobility, and Brahmacharya. This is the only way to ensure one's success. As it was written by Indian saints who were both inspired and enlightened, the book that is now available, titled Practice of Karma Yoga, is an excellent and trustworthy guide to the aspirant's aim.",

Joy is the most expansive state; it illuminates the distances and the heights, it opens wide upon what happens, what is. There are people who understand that to seek fulfilment in the love of one or several people is to close off the love and joy of what the universe lays forth every day. Anxiety is the feeling of being isolated by the retreat of the environment about one and an intensification of the sense of oneself. There are people who actively seek out risks.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY. Experiential personal constructivism is based upon the fundamental premise that human intimacy (termed \"ROLE relationships\") is both absolutely essential for meaning in life yet is filled with terror. As such, persons both approach and retreat from these relationships. While retreating from these relationships allows us to feel safe, we also numb ourselves to the full experience of our interpersonal world. \"Symptoms\" of \"psychopathology\" (including symptoms of panic) are ways in which we tell ourselves that we are not engaging in ROLE relationships as extensively as we could. By courageously exploring our ways of limiting intimacy, due mostly to horrendous discontinuations, we can use our experience of \"symptomatology\" to grow in ways that allow us to experience self, other, and world more richly. This type of growth, toward reverence or awe, is the true end of therapy. [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery Service: 1-800-342-9678.

Consequently , Al-Husseini theatre theory finds a headway in reality and purports certain goals that meet the requirements of modernity. Man strives from dawn to dusk to keep himself on a subsistence level; holds his ethos to his heart and grits his teeth to cast felicity and contentment in a community . Sometimes he feels forlorn and desires to be in one trench with other people , sometimes not does he run counter to a violent meandering tide just to shield a precept or a doctrine . Such obsessive convulsions lead him , intermittently , to whisper :Never give up on your dreams and goals,Even though it seems too lateThe Almighty God who is in control,Will send blessings to you if you wait.",

As Iris Marion Young (1997) puts it, opening up to the other person is always a gift—and a risk. Our gesture of opening up to the other person may not be welcomed, or our counterparts may be reluctant to reciprocate. On other occasions, in simply trying to attend to a practical matter, we get drawn into a much more involved social interaction than we expected. In some ways, this vulnerable state of affairs is how it has to be: the magic of a pleasant and exciting encounter with a stranger derives its value in part from having dared to take a risk that then led to a positive outcome.",

She has seen first-hand and on numerous occasions, people become strongly agitated or extremely fidgety, emotionally fall apart, and constantly crave to be reunited with their high-tech device when they have left it behind or it is misplaced. She cannot describe it in any other way than there every thought is obsessed by its absence. Desires and cravings if not tempered can work to have negative consequences. The folly is in that we are willingly beckoning in these times without thinking about the social implications for us and for future generations. Rather than lusting for our high-tech gadgetry we should be lusting for life - there is a difference. When high-tech lust turns ugly it becomes high-tech disdain. We can develop a dislike, and even disgust for technological apparatus. We may even seek in-part or total separation away from it. It becomes the opposite of brand love; it becomes brand hate. Some parents regret the day they handed their child an Internet-enabled computer, registered an e-mail address or bought a smartphone for them.

      "abstract": "Abraham Lincoln, until past forty, was a failure in almost all activities he undertook. When asked about the change,he said, “My father taught me to work but did not teach me to love my work. I hit that accidentally, when I was forty.” People differ not only in their ability to do but also in their “love to do”. This “love or will to do” (called Motivation) depends upon the strength of their motives. Motivation is an internal driving force which results in persistent behavior directed towards a particular goal. Thus people who are motivated are driven by a desire to achieve the goal that they perceive as having value to them. Motives are the expressed needs and could be conscious or subconscious. They are always directed towards goals. These motives drive people to act. Needs are more basic than wants. For example, putting on clothes is a need, whereas putting on a Louis Philippe shirt is a want. A need may lead to different wants for different people. This differentiation comes from the influence of environment in which one lives. For achieving what a person wants, he will think about what alternative actions will be required to be taken by him. He will then evaluate these possible actions, and then select the one with the least cost (effort). Employees will be motivated to carry out the assigned task to the extent, if doing so satisfies their personal needs. Work is, thus, viewed only as an effort to satisfy needs and expectations. Motivation is not a personal trait, but a result of the interaction between the individual and the situation. It may be defined as the willingness to exert high level of efforts towards organizational goals, conditioned by the effort’s ability to satisfy some individual need. The efforts should not only be of high intensity, but must also be channelized in such a way that organizational goals are accomplished and the personal needs are satisfied.",

      "abstract": "When the situation calls for a more assertive response than level 2, our face becomes more neutral, more detached. Our eyes shift from soft to neutral or slightly hard (see Chapter 25, “Eye Expressions”). The pace of our speech slows, and the pitch of our voice becomes less inflected. Our intent is to be clear and assertive in a way that needs little explanation. Our statement is brief, because the more words we use, the less effective our stance can become. Confidence in using level 3 provides us with a sliding scale for being as assertive as necessary. Whether our message is delivered in person, on the phone, or in writing, its meaning and intent are uncluttered and clearly stated. Sometimes we use level 3 when the assertive message of level 2 is not being received. A level 3 response is one that has us standing our ground in ways that levels 1 and 2 do not. Our state of mind when we convey level 3 assertiveness is calm, strong, and mildly commanding. Our message is both clear and succinct. Imagine an administrator saying to you, “I’ve heard some par­ent complaints about your discipline, and I’d like you to go easy on the kids for a while.” Many of us would have an immediate “hackles raised” reaction. In level 3, we may say with focused confidence and strength, “I’m always open to conversations about what and how I teach. How soon could we schedule an appointment so you can tell me what you’re thinking, and we can discuss this?” In and out of school, level 3 responses provide a way to be strong, not brash; clear, not sarcastic; forceful, not oppressive. Whether managing students, negotiating with authorities, solv­ing problems with a forceful parent, or replying to an angry stranger, we can maintain peace and power through our words and attitudes.",

      "abstract": "Reading Danica Vukićević (bio) Above all else, reading implies silence, muteness amidst talking. Something an intelligent person frequently wishes for: conversation without sound, dialogue without noise, and—most importantly—the lack of resistance of an interlocutor. Reading, of all spiritual needs and habits, is the most lascivious, the most sexual, the most passionate. Its satisfactions run the gamut of vice for the wicked soul. Reading is universally disseminated; even people who don't read like to say: \"I love it so much . . .\" And the book has been a friend to humankind. For reasons we all know, the insights of postmodernism make it clear that even the age of viewing, the era of clicking and passive meltdown has sunk into a stage of acute displacement, so the book is all the more important, more valuable, as a piece of an era that has pointedly passed. It can only be—decadence itself. Even without reading, books are mysterious, but only upon reading does the material object take on the characteristics of a radical mystery seeking a commitment not necessarily radical. Reading is a job, an unacknowledged profession. Reading demands a great deal: devotion, fidelity, a set amount of attention not varying in quantity or quality. Reading is a challenge, a duel, spirit against spirit. And a dance, mind with mind. It incorporates inexhaustible possibilities for living relationships within which, like a cell of cancer, all kinds of new surfaces, structures, worlds, and frauds multiply. Reading beguiles, strings us along, and beckons us into places where one just does not go. A game of expectations, attention, earnestness, and agreements. It unmasks both the world and the world of the reader; it presents itself as a light-hearted escapade or a dubious aim and connection. What kind of world does reading offer? An unknown, unexpected one, with an empire of details that can produce lasting effects. Reading: a student's nightmare, death in an unfamiliar Venice. Bread and wine for some people, and a bad habit for the uninitiated. It's definitely not without risk. Although invisible, it can convey the most heterogeneous magic spells, black and white. Reading demands habituation, solidarity, with the other, with the foreign. To get its new skin, a snake must do a dance of contractions, and the same thing is required of a reader. Reading makes change happen: ridiculous, powerful, consequential, fake, all sorts of change, if the reading is at least a little bit open. No arrogance is [End Page 152] permitted in reading. Mildness and good intentions, and understanding even for what is most shocking or bizarre—these things yield wondrous fruits. In reading, everything is the same as in the relations between people, only a little bit better. It animates the quick and the dead, and its giving is votive and nuptial. It is possible not to read. No one has ever died from not reading. But reading is absolutely irreplaceable. To some people it is a screen and a shield, a summons \"against,\" a war of the outside world against the warmth that only it, reading, offers. There's also a number that is important, for the first and second readings are never the same, like testing an old love in a motel room. A confrontation with one's varying essences. It's like a diver entering the water—going in and never coming out. Reading is a project, a terrifying one, and a transformation; the \"I\" gets transferred—somewhere—somewhere else—becomes the world. The lying and the deceived, all of them cheat. They converse and love each other, as long as the reading lasts. -THE END- Translation: John K.

These couples experience events and opportunities including returns-to-work after laborforce gaps, job changes, geographical relocations, infertility, unplanned business trips and workloads, and sleep deprivation during early child rearing years. As they devise strategies for managing these stressful situations both individually and collectively, they adapt to and transform their new normals by enacting communication resilience processes. Throughout the case, there are episodes in which they, and the children (Eden and Lucy), perform the five processes: crafting normalcy; using, maintaining, and creating new networks; backgrounding negative feelings while foregrounding productive action; utilizing alternative logics; and anchoring identities. They enact resilience for themselves and others, for the present and the future, and by reflecting upon their pasts.",

      "abstract": "The human brain is a computer, built to process information about the environment and to judge which is most likely to be successful from a large number of possible courses of outcome. In a complex environment, decision making at high speed is going to be one of the necessary requirements of any animal if it is to survive and prosper. Some animals, of course, protect themselves from having to make too many momentous decisions by covering themselves with a thick armor so that the world can change around them while they plod on unheedingly. Man is the greatest risk taker of them all. Human beings even have the extraordinary capacity for enjoying danger. People like to take ride on roller coasters, to drive fast cars, to engage in highly competitive sports, and of course, they also like such intellectually risky practices as gambling. There is no person on earth who cannot take a risk and who does not enjoy it at least to some degree. Life presents us with risks every day: take too many and you are in trouble, take none and you will stagnate. Risk refers to the probability or outcomes which are measurable in a quantitative manner. Risk is a combination of the probability, or frequency, of occurrence of a defined hazard. Risk is defined as the ‘possible loss of something of value’. Risk is the probability of an event combined with the magnitude of losses and gains that it will entail. Risk is that which allows for a number of possible outcomes, not all of which are bad. In this complex world, each one of us is exposed to a lot of risky moments. It is the need of the hour to understand the risk involved in our surroundings and its influence on us. The vital question in this connection is “How much of a risk taker are we?” This study has the social objective of identifying the extent of risk as perceived by individuals having different roles in society.",

      "title": "A lifeSPANS approach: Addressing child obesity in Australia",
      "abstract": "Compelling populations, individuals or even ourselves to act pre-emptively on the urgent and massive challenges of tomorrow is notoriously difficult. The concept is called temporal or future discounting, and it is well documented.1 It is the idea that we prioritise our current comfort and happiness over our future and seemingly distant safety or wellbeing. This psychological shortcoming plays out in many ways. At the micro level, we may defer until next week what we should do today—that run, drinking more water or the dentist check-up—as it may not reap benefits for months, or ever. Eventually, we may act on some of these but whether delayed, deferred or denied, it can reap serious health consequences. At the macro level, it becomes even more problematic. When we combine this “delay what's beyond tomorrow” phenomenon with short-term political cycles in the context of systems-based, slowly evolving and largely invisible future threats, important but not yet imminent issues are not just postponed, but ignored. Few challenges are a greater threat to the health of Australians, nor better define future discounting, than obesity. At the individual level and in our modern, obesogenic societies, weight gain has become the norm—the biological and social path of least resistance. Food systems have shifted from a focus on seasonal, fresh and relatively calorie-poor staples with minimal processing or meat, to an environment where junk foods and processed foods are ubiquitous, heavily advertised, hugely profitable and, for many communities, the only feasible “choice”. Poor nutrition is now the leading risk factor for disease in our country.2 City living has come with benefits, but along with an increasingly automated and digitalised lifestyle, has seen physical activity become something we must seek out, rather than an unavoidable component of our daily lives. Factors such as these have made individual action difficult for most of us and combined with our biology, have contributed to obesity rates more than doubling in Australia since 1980 alone.3 At the policy level, a dangerous, pernicious and unhealthy status quo has evolved over decades. One which sees a population increasingly affected by preventable, chronic disease. One which can only be solved through difficult decisions from politicians and the public to make the short-term, passive but unhealthy comfort harder; and the long-term promise of wellbeing more attractive. One which must see sustained public demand and political commitment for a distant goal and best scenario of nil-effect, in the face of constant, coordinated and powerful pushback, threats and careful intimidation from largely unprecedented policy counter-currents. But opportunities do exist; levers throughout this gridlocked policy landscape that can be utilised to move the obesity agenda forward. One of those is our kids. We know that if we cannot prevent obesity in our children, those young Australians will likely never achieve wellbeing. We know that one in four of our children is overweight or obese and that while 5% of healthy weight kids become obese adults, up to 79% obese children will never realise a healthy weight.4, 5 We know that the school years are a time when major weight gain occurs in our lifecourse and almost no one loses weight as they age.6 Recent evidence suggests early, simple interventions not only reduce weight and improve the health for our youngest kids, but also reduce weight in their parents.7, 8 An important network of effective implementation platforms and primed partners already exist in our schools and teachers around the nation. Finally, a large (but likely overstated) proportion of Australians may call “nanny state” at even the whiff of effective policies against obesity, but less so if those policies are aimed at our children. With this in mind, I was recently invited to Canberra to present on how I would spend an extra $100 million each year on preventive health for the nation. This is the five-point policy plan I proposed; a lifeSPANS approach to addressing child obesity—and with it, equipping a new generation of Australians to act on tomorrow's risks, today. This is an evidence-based package to reduce the major sources of premature deaths, starting early. Schools alone cannot solve the child obesity epidemic; however, it is unlikely that child obesity rates can be reversed without strong school-based policies to support healthy eating and physical activity. Children and adolescents consume 19%-50% of daily calories at school and spend more time there than in any other environment away from home.11 Evidence suggests that “incentives” are unlikely to result in behaviour change but peer pressure might.12 Therefore, learning among friends offers a unique opportunity to positively influence healthy habits. Trials have demonstrated both the educational and health benefits of providing free school meals, including increased fruit and vegetable consumption, knowledge of a healthy diet, healthier eating at home and improved school performance. Providing meals to all children supports low-income families and works to address health inequalities and stigma.10 School vending machines or canteens selling sugary drinks and junk foods further fuel an obesogenic, modern food environment. Sugary drinks are the leading source of added sugar in our diet in Australia and are considered a major individual risk factor for non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.13 Removing unhealthy foods and drinks from schools would support children, teachers and parents and send a powerful message to communities about the health harms of these products. Finally, it is not only about taking things away but also supporting locally driven programs and the school infrastructure to support healthier habits. Drinking fountains, play equipment and canteen hardware could all be supported through small grants aimed at further empowering schools as decisions makers and agents for healthier kids. Today's food environment sees increased availability of lower cost, processed foods high in salt, fats and added sugars.14 People have less time to prepare meals and are influenced by aggressive food marketing. This leads to food inequality with those from low socioeconomic backgrounds at greater risk from obesity. Obesity increases the risks of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, cancer, mental health issues and premature death.15 There are also wider societal and economic costs amounting to an estimated $8.6 billion spent in the health sector alone annually.16 Food prices should be adjusted in relation to nutritional content. Policy makers must shift their pricing focus to integrate the true societal cost of products associated with fiscally burdensome disease. In 2016, a WHO report highlighted that a 20% increase in retail price of sugary drinks lowers consumption as well as obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay.17 The landmark peso per litre sugar tax from Mexico highlighted the behaviour change potential such policies possess. Sales of higher priced beverages decreased substantially in subsequent years. Importantly, the most significant decreases occurred among the poorest households.18 For Australia, a similar approach is estimated to lead to $609 million in annual health savings and raise $400 million in direct revenue.16 These legislative approaches should be framed as an expansion of our existing GST and would encourage industry to reformulate products, positively influencing the food environment.13, 15, 17 This is not a sin tax or ban, it is an effective policy and pricing that is fair to families. It is also backed by evidence and supported by the public.19 The food industry knows that marketing works, otherwise they would not spend almost $400 million annually on advertisements in Australia alone.20 Three of four commercial food advertisements are for unhealthy products and evidence suggests that food advertising triggers cognitive processes that influence our food choices, similar to those seen in addiction. Studies also demonstrate that food commercials including the use of cartoons influence the amount of calories that children consume and the findings are particularly pronounced in overweight children.21 Fast food advertising at sporting and arts events further reinforces a dangerous and confusing notion that sees the direct association between societal heroes or elite athleticism and the unhealthiest of foods. Ending junk food advertising to children, including any use of cartoons in the advertisement of food and drinks, is an important step to support our kids. Nutritional information can be confusing for parents, let alone children. Food packaging often lists nutritional information in relation to portion size meaning a product with a higher figure may simply be larger rather than less healthy. While the Health Star Rating system, implemented in 2014, has made substantive progress, it remains voluntary.22 Efforts should be made to strengthen the usability of existing efforts and make consistent, evidence-based and effective labelling mandatory. Such developments would also provide stronger incentives for manufacturers to reformulate products, reducing sugar, fat and salt content. Clearer and consistent information would help create a more enabling food environment for families to make informed choices about their food. Coordinated strategies are needed to support the availability of lower cost, healthy foods for all communities. Cities and large organisations such as schools and hospitals could collaborate to purchase food as collectives, thus driving demand, building market size and improving economies of scale.23 By leveraging collective purchasing power, institutions can catalyse the availability of sustainable and healthy foods to also support wider, positive food environment change. The answer to obesity will never be in telling people what to do, guilting them for making unhealthier choices in a confusing consumption landscape, or by simply banning things. We also know that education and knowledge will get us only so far. The real answers lie not even in inspiring populations to make hundreds of healthier decisions each and every day in the face of a seductively obesogenic, social milieu. If we are to drive long-term, sustained and scalable change, we must tweak the system to ensure those healthier choices become the path of least resistance—and eventually preferred. And I believe we must focus, initially, on our kids. It is time for a lifeSPANS approach to addressing obesity in Australia.",

Authority is fused with the clock. And the dissenter who wanders from the compelling path of time will be severely punished, so that in the end fear of failing a grade, perhaps, or losing a job compels submission to the clock. Fear and the implicit promise that a future will be secured if only everyone learns to be on time. And the little time remaining to us in a day, the unbound time, is free for empathy and love. all relationships in our culture have a temporal dimension, so that as we wait for the one who finally arrives and later leaves, we not only perceive time but feel it. Anxiety, anger, and love may all be expressed by the simple question, When? And the empathetic use of time, bringing us into rhythm with others so that we move to the same emotional pulse, creates whatever social harmony we will know in the course of a day, or night. So empathy may create its own temporal order, and fear may compel submission to a timetable and which of these shall move the classroom clock?

      "title": "The Rule of Fear and Hindsight in World Politics",
      "abstract": "HERE have been various causes of war in the past. Population pressures, dynastic ambition, religion, economic rivalry and other factors have helped to keep the story of man one of ever-recurrent bloodletting. Yet the oldest cause of all is fear-fear of neighbors in the jungle who are different, who either are warlike or may be, fear of men who have different rites and customs, fear of nations that are or may be hostile. Fear feeds all the other causes of war and sometimes no other cause is necessary. Each war, too, leaves its crop of fears to torment men and nations and predispose them to future wars. It is natural for a man or a nation to fear the recurrence of a bad experience. It lives on in memory and is hard to dispose of rationally. It is instinctive to fear that it will come again. If buried by time and much reassurance, fear that the scourge will return still lies in the subconscious mind, ready to appear in dreams, or in daylight hours. Many millions of Americans who were badly hurt by the Great Depression may be prosperous enough now, but they still dread a return of the fear, the privation, the deadening sense of not being needed or wanted, in another collapse. The ever more horrible nature of war makes it absolutely inevitable that even the greatest nations should have deep neuroses about their wartime experiences, and that they should strive mightily to avert a return of the terror and suffering and degradation which afflicted them so deeply. Today, the strong probability is that the clash of mutual fears will destroy Western civilization, at least in the north temperate zone. The vast races of the Orient are far more likely to survive, and to inherit the earth, but the nations of the West seem doomed to be driven by their fears to mutual oblivion.",

For those people who have never encountered a young deaf child it is hard to understand how much difference it can make. One might think of what a person misses who cannot hear music, or church bells, or the birds sing. One might think of some of the practical problems of having a small deaf child, that he does not hear cars coming, a horn hooting; that one cannot call out to warn of danger and so one has to keep him close. But it is not these things that constitute the real problem. Life is impoverished without the joy that various sounds can bring, and there are situations which can be dangerous for someone who cannot hear; but there are greater problems than these. It is learning to understand other people, and to talk to them, that is the real area of difficulty.",

What I am moved by is what brings it about that I feel or act the way I do. To be ‘unmoved’ is to be unresponsive; or, at times, to lack compassion. To be moved by something or someone often involves having care or concern for that which is found moving. A variety of this sort of concern just could be an essential ingredient in the stance of the environmental preservationist.",

This may offend what in us is sentimental, fashionable, or dishonest; and nowhere more so than in his exploration of violence. We are repelled by violence, afraid of it, yet fascinated, vicariously avid, as so many of our entertainments bear witness. But we insulate ourselves from ourselves in comforting ways. Some people argue that domestic violence is essentially a male phenomenon. Anthropologists and politicians differ about whether violence is innate or the product of conditioning, social class, or deprivation. Most of us would like to think that it can be contained by improving social organization and welfare. We suppose ourselves to be peaceable and that what we read in the newspapers is about people quite other than ourselves, if perhaps less fortunate.",

      "abstract": "Given the current disruption of normal life, I have decided to offer a very different format for the next few editorials. Something that is whimsical and hopefully entertaining and maybe a little thought provoking. This first piece is a children's story about P values and confidence intervals. Once upon a time, there was a small village where all the people lived in complete comfort and certainty. The village was painted in only black or white; there was no color anywhere. The zoo was filled with pandas, ravens, zebras, and other creatures that felt right at home. Everything was very clear, which made things quite simple and pleasant for everyone. Answers to questions were either yes or no. Explanations were never required. Few people ever bothered themselves with questions like why or how, because that created a lot of unnecessary discussion and confusion and was believed to contribute to wrinkles on the forehead and gray hairs (which were not allowed). If ever a difficult question was asked that could not be answered with a simple yes or no, the villagers took their question to a special person, Ronald Fisher. Ronald would listen to difficult questions and reduce them to a yes or no response, which was pleasing for everyone. He would then consult his magical tables of probability to divide things into two groups: those that were significant (YES) and those that were not (NO). Although the people were happy and comfortable with the answers that Ronald gave, he was not always correct. It turns out that, 5% of the time, Ronald's answers were wrong. Then, one day, a traveler from another village came to visit. She was dressed very differently from the villagers. She wore bright colorful clothing with an interesting hat and a lovely bag. It was impossible to describe her in simple terms. This made some people very uncomfortable, and they did not make her feel welcome. Others who saw her were curious to know more and could not look away; they were kind to her. They saw something different and were not afraid. Her name was Jerzy Neyman. She was confident and she embraced uncertainty and possibilities. In fact, variety was so important to her that she introduced the idea to others wherever she traveled. Nothing about her was easily described. Her hair was a shade of brown with hints of red chestnut. Her shoes were not pink or red but somewhere in between. Depending on the light, her ring flashed a spectrum of colors that demanded a more complex description. When the villagers asked Jerzy to compare two things, her answer was usually: “It depends…not just on the difference, but also on the variety of other possibilities.” Her stories were interesting and brought color to the village. The villagers learned to accept that the answers to questions are more informative when you consider the full range of possibilities and probabilities. The villagers began to understand the reasons behind the answers they were given by Ronald, including why the answers were sometimes wrong. Then, people began asking more interesting questions.",

People want to become Somebody because they believe that unless they succeed in that respect they will turn out to be a mere mediocrity, or worse still, to be thought of as a mere mediocrity. People want to leave some sort of mark in this world before they die. They do not want their passage through this world to be utterly ineffectual.

Each person needs to understand how choices impact their ability to cope and survive. By learning how to better make choices, perhaps we can better survive violent crime. Violent criminal acts occur in all societies. The ability to survive them is enhanced by our resilience. This is tied to one's ability to be empathic. In societies that foster empathy, one becomes better able to cope. Techniques for coping are also important in our ability to become resilient, as is social support. Coping successfully requires that one focuses upon reachable goals. The greater the bond with another person, the greater the hurt will be when they die. Likewise, the powerful impact of violent crime can intensify the hurt. Bonding with others may also enhance resilience and allow one to better cope.",

      "abstract": "Rugby has a fantastic bonding effect ... It brings friendships to the fore ... You get strong guys up front, quick guys in the back, you get poets, you get freemasons, everybody playing in the same team and it's a fantastic culture. (Francois Pienaar, Captain, South Africa, World Cup Winners 1995).\r\n\r\nAs the quote used to introduce this chapter illustrates, team unity (or team cohesion) can generate strong emotions among team members. But, as anyone who has been a captain, manager, player, or observer of rugby can testify, achieving team unity and getting a team to work together to achieve its collective goals can be difficult. Individual team members sometimes have personal goals and aspirations that bring them into conflict with the team's goals and objectives. As a consequence, those individuals may try to pull the team in different directions. Or, teammates may dislike each other with the resulting consequence that communication on and off the pitch becomes poor or nonexistent. Or, teammates may like each other so much that a considerable amount of effort is expended to insure that harmony is preserved—at the expense of honest appraisal, accurate feedback and open communication.\r\n\r\nObservations by Pat Riley (1993), a very successful North American professional coach, help to illustrate how difficult it is to obtain teamwork. As Riley noted, \r\nTeamwork isn't simple. In fact, it can be a frustrating elusive commodity… teamwork doesn't appear magically, just because someone mouths the words. It doesn't thrive because of the presence of talent or ambition. It doesn't flourish simply because a team has tasted success. (p.16)\r\nSo what steps can team leaders/coaches take to ensure that a team is actively working to become more unified and cohesive? In the present chapter, we focus on four strategies that have been used successfully in sport teams: team performance profiling, team goal setting, a gameplan exercise to develop role clarity and role acceptance, and an exercise to promote mutual respect.",

My self is with me at every moment of every day, I have access to its inner thoughts and feelings, and I am hardly liable to mistake someone else for me. At the same time, the self is surprisingly elusive and opaque. What, after all, is a self? Is it some kind of object? If so, what kind? If not an object, what then? Is our sense of self ultimately illusory? Something that disappears when studied too closely? Our understanding of the self is replete with puzzles and paradoxes: I cannot be anyone but who I am, and yet everyone will acknowledge that there are circumstances in which being oneself is extremely difficult. If I change enough, I can be said to have become someone else, and yet I somehow remain to deal with the consequences of the alteration. I cannot get away from myself, and yet I can find and lose myself.",

      "title": "The Rule of Family Faith: Practicing the Presence of God in Our Outward Lives",
      "abstract": "amily spirituality does not always look like “spirituality” as many people understand it. When we think of spirituality, we often picture inner peace and tranquility. But families are anything but tranquil. In fact, if you want to turn your life upside down, entertain a serious love relationship, consider marriage, or better yet, have a child. To obtain the serenity we often associate with spirituality, one would have to flee all this for the desert or monastery, as some early church fathers did. We also envision spirituality in terms of revelatory mountaintop experiences, the kind religious mystics claim. But again, such an occurrence seems more likely to happen on retreat from, not in the middle of, domestic life. In search of epiphany, people have often left home and family and embarked on a journey. Taking care of a home is actually one of the most ordinary of activities. In fact, preparing food, cleaning toilets, and folding laundry can be downright humdrum, drab, and dreary. It is the kind of work that is never finished and that endlessly recycles, rising up again almost as soon as one has finished the last load of wash or cleaned the most recent mess. Those who cannot pursue either monasticism or mystical visions often turn to the church and congregational worship as the heart of faith. But once again those with kids, especially families with young children, can sometimes find it difficult to get everyone out the door, into the car, and to church on Sunday morning without a minor family feud over who wears what or sits where, arriving frazzled and distraught from the effort. Once there, children’s noise and constant movement are often unwelcome. So families disperse to age-appropriate settings, such as a cry room, and then leave, wondering whether the faith of the family as a whole has been deepened or further fragmented. Neither child nor adult knows what the other encountered for",

      "abstract": "Kindness and generosity can transform people's lives. The power of generosity is not only transformative for the person on the receiving end, but also for the generous giver as well. There are some warnings to those being kind and compassionate. Encountering others who are not accustomed to a culture of generosity sometimes provokes feelings of mistrust as to the intent. There have also been nefarious misuses of giving by people with ill intent. Emotional generosity is the epitome of love that humans can show. Seeing a need and fulfilling that need. Educators must have a keen understanding of individuals and make a personal investment in working to help them to be successful. \"Good\" generosity should be something that truly meets a need and has the virtue of being good. \"Free\" generosity should not only come without a monetary cost, but also without the expectation of any form of reciprocity or quid pro quo.",

      "abstract": "Every human being must have felt that there is something lacking in them, some people feel lacking because of difficulties and some people are also grounded because of thoughts or psychological influences. Both have a real impact on their own suffering. Having a deficiency of one of our five main senses must have a pretty significant impact. This book is written to discuss one of them, which is the rhetoric on the senses of hearing. Having this hearing impairment can be due to genetic factors (derivatives); congenital (from within the womb); or what we can as long as we live our lives. This prevents recipients from socializing and some people in the community may even stay away from them, because they find it difficult to communicate with them. This can make her suffering feel isolated, fearful, and give up to struggle to live her life. As my fellow humans have a sense of empathy for them, i can imagine how difficult it is for them to live their day-to-day lives in the midst of a civilization that relies on sound as the primary sign or signal to communicate. Then you have to help them and give them the \"ears to see.\" Keywords: empthy; hearing disorder; spatial perception Abstrak Setiap manusia pasti pernah merasa ada sesuatu yang kurang dalam diri mereka, ada yang memang merasakan kekurangan karena mengalami kesulitan dan ada juga yang dilandasi karena pikiran atau pengaruh psikologis. Keduanya memiliki dampak yang nyata pada diri penderitanya. Memiliki kekurangan dari salah satu lima panca indera utama kita pasti memiiki dampak yang cukup signifikan. Tulisan ini ditulis untuk membahas salah satunya yaitu kekuranagn pada indera pendengaran. Memiliki gangguan pendengaran ini bisa dikarenakan faktor genetik ( turunan ); kongenital (dari sejak dalam kandungan ); maupun yang kita dapat selama kita menjalani kehidupan. Hal ini menghambat penerita untuk bersosialisasi dan beberapa orang dalam masyarakat pun mungkin menjauhi mereka, karena merasa sulit untuk berkomunikasi dengan mereka. Hal ini bisa membuat penderitanya merasa diasingkan, ketakutan, dan menyerah untuk berjuang menjalani kehidupannya. Sebagai sesama manusia saya memiliki rasa empati terhadap mereka, saya membayangkan betapa sulitnya bagi mereka untuk menjalani kehidupan sehari - harinya di tengah peradaban yang mengandalkan bunyi sebagai tanda atau sinyal utama untuk berkomunikasi, bahkan beberapa rambu lalu lintas pun juga menggunakan bunyi sebagai penanda.

But a puzzle arises when we ask what the basis for such love is. People who want us to feel loved say they love us because ‘we’re special’ and because ‘there is no one quite like us’; they also say they love us for particular characteristics: for our red hair, for our quirky sense of humour, for ‘being the baby of the family’, and so on. It might seem natural to conclude that others’ love of us is based on our uniquely valuable personal characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Figure: EP life, first personFigureBleh. Meh. I'm just kind of over this. Everything. I recently read a New York Times column by Wharton psychologist Adam Grant on languishing, and it definitely hit the spot: “It wasn't burnout—we still had energy. It wasn't depression—we didn't feel hopeless. We just felt somewhat joyless and aimless. It turns out there's a name for that: languishing. “Languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness,” he wrote. “It feels as if you're muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield. And it might be the dominant emotion of 2021. “Part of the danger is that when you're languishing, you might not notice the dulling of delight or the dwindling of drive. You don't catch yourself slipping slowly into solitude; you're indifferent to your indifference. When you can't see your own suffering, you don't seek help or even do much to help yourself.” (April 19, 2021; https://nyti.ms/3bCYUpy.) Languishing certainly hit all the right notes for me, but I still felt like something was missing from how I've been feeling over the past few months. Languishing doesn't include the exhaustion that I feel from being nowhere near the finish line of COVID-19, while the vaccinations are making the rest of society feel like it can open back up and go back to normal. As ED volumes have begun to climb back to pre-pandemic levels, it just feels like “yes...and.” Yes, and keep doing all the COVID stuff: Wear a gown and face shield. Keep the patient under investigation if he says “shortness of breath” or “fever” or “cough” or “runny nose” or if he is hypoxic or tachypneic because it's all on you if you miss a single case of COVID. Delay the patient's care and hold him in the ED until his COVID swab comes back, and then the consultant will see him because the ED staff are more than happy to hold patients in their infinite beds and see undifferentiated PUI patients, but no one else needs to. Make numerous additional phone calls and play phone tag with family members, caregivers, nursing home staff, and durable powers of attorney because no visitors are allowed. Yes, and go ahead and see all the other patients who have decided to show up at the ED without our getting any additional resources when we were already nearing our capacity to keep the plates all spinning in early 2020. So, yeah, languishing ain't cutting it as a term for how I'm feeling. Throw languishing and some more garbage into this ED cauldron, and then it might start to be an authentic elixir: Boarding patients in the ED Practicing hallway medicine Acting as some sort of limbo-yet-also-solution for our broken, poorly funded mental health system Compassion fatigue, which is different from burnout (but can lead to it), a common consequence of exposure to patient experiences and suffering combined with roles that require empathy Vicarious trauma, the internal shift in emotions, spirituality, and worldview that occur over the course of indirect exposure to trauma Burnout, a triad of emotional exhaustion (nothing left to give), depersonalization (negative, callous, and detached responses to others), and reduced sense of personal accomplishment (feelings of competence and achievement in one's work) Simmer one part global COVID pandemic in there with some Oil of Languishing and a dash of all of the above, and there's your recipe for how I've been feeling. You know those horrible, horrible days of your career where you have an absolutely devastating case—maybe a young cardiac arrest or an absolutely overwhelming trauma—and then after it's all over, you start to think about what happened, and then realize you still have seven hours of a shift to get through? That's what it feels like right now. Except it's not one case, it's a year of cases, and you don't even know if your shift will ever end. There's no time to reflect, process, or grieve about this past year. There's no pat on the back, ticker tape parade, or sigh of relief. It's just, “Welp, let's keep going. Three more ambulances just showed up.” I think I've come up with a term that maybe fits how I'm feeling: medical despondency. Despondency itself has a pretty good definition: a state of low spirits caused by loss of hope or courage, but I actually like the Latin roots even more. The adjective despondent is from the Latin despondere, from the prefix de- (from, away) and spondere (to promise). “Away from my promise” is as a good descriptor as any, I guess.

      "title": "Making It Easy to Believe: A Tourist Goes to the Psychic Fair",
      "abstract": "What is a non-believer to do in the face of an exhibition of the supernatural by those variously called psychics, clairvoyants, seers, mystics, sensitives or spiritualists? While clearly the agreement between the exhibitor and the client/spectator calls for belief in the supernatural’s existence and immediate presence, disbelief does not preclude a relationship. If I am a non-believer, however, I must read the event quite differently based on the intentions of the exhibitor. I can consider the exhibitor a liar, and observe the event as if it is fraud; in this case I might watch in stony silence, or vocal effrontery, or cynical amusement, depending on the extent of the exhibitor’s power over the client/spectator, the amount of money changing hands … and the strength of my own disbelief. I might consider the exhibitor genuine but self-deluded, and observe the event with astonishment, or anger, or condescension - again, depending on my perception of any danger to believers, or to myself. Finally, I can witness the exhibition of the supernatural as if it is a theatrical performance, and admire and assess the psychic according to character and spectacle. I would then put aside the non-believer’s concerns about fraud and self-delusion and assume a measure of theatrical self-consciousness on the part of all concerned. To some extent this may be true; a good “show” can be appreciated under any belief system. To some extent, however, I suggest that this is another form of self-delusion, a false “as if” that positions the event at a comfortable distance and the spectator on an apparently safer higher ground from which to watch. 1 While the cultures of the occult and the theatre have a long and inextricably complex relationship, both have just as complex a relationship with the culture of commerce. Not all psychics conduct their readings as small businesses, any more than all theatrical performance is commercial. But to the extent that commerce is a goal, strategies are at work that are not necessarily theatrical. 2",

      "abstract": "Everyone today has too much to do and too little time—that's not going to change. The only way to make our lives less stressful is to make sure we spend more time doing the things that matter most and less time doing the things that matter less. When we're not clear on what is really important, we make thoughtless and impulsive choices and end up feeling exhausted and unfulfilled. Bestselling author Brian Tracy teams up with therapist Christina Stein to show how to find true balance—when all your actions and choices are guided by a profound knowledge of your deepest personal values, vision, purpose, and goals. Not only will you feel less stressed, but you'll accomplish more, and more efficiently, than you ever thought possible. When you operate from your true balance point, you feel clear and focused, and everything in your life feels like it is in perfect harmony. You go through your day with courage, confidence, and purpose because everything you do is in alignment with who you are. Through questions that guide you to reflect and focus, as well as concrete action steps and exercises, Tracy and Stein help you discover your personal balance point and show how you can use it to set priorities and manage your time in a way that both energizes you and simplifies every aspect of your life. The result is a new, active approach to integrating life balance, work achievement, and time management.",

He blamed his job at first, then the unexpected death of a cousin he had never really known, but finally he concluded that there was no reason at all for his feelings of sadness and dread. He, himself, was the reason. That sensation one gets when in the midst of setting out on a task or making a statement the mind pauses, loses its thread, and the only choice is to turn to something new—his whole soul was trapped inside that feeling; it was as if his consciousness had slipped into the silent instant inside a stutter. It wasn't the first time this had occurred, but in the past there had always been something to pull him out of it: a desire for his parents' approval, which was slightly out of reach, a desire to get away from [End Page 81] Hudson Falls; for a long time there was the simple desire for sex, which was then gradually replaced by the desire for a beautiful wife and beautiful children and a home he could be proud of. Before these later desires had turned to substance, he had also wanted to write. In high school and college he had read a number of novels that had moved him incredibly, moved him the way he supposed religion moved others, and he had wanted desperately to emulate them. But right before graduating he fell in love with Tracy, and she surprised him by loving him back, and he used that love as a springboard for a comfortable life. And then one day that comfort was not enough; nothing was. He took the pictures of his family off his desk and put them in his drawer. He stared out the window of his office on the twenty-seventh floor of the Amoco Building, stared out at the comfortless iron landscape. He thought about how quick the snap of pavement would be, closed his door and wept, forced himself to call Tracy at work and say, holding his head in his hands, I don't know why, but I've got this feeling the world would be a better place if I weren't in it. He spent four weeks in the psychiatric ward of Northwestern Memorial, not eating, not sleeping, barely getting out of bed. When he did try to talk or move or go to the bathroom, his muscles felt dull and heavy, as if he were trying to run underwater. The doctors started him on a hefty dose of Zoloft. When he promised them he was no longer having fantasies about shooting himself or injecting ink into his veins, they let him go home. He spent two months recuperating in his house, unable to return to the advertising agency where he had worked for over ten years. Tracy was not pressuring him, but he had begun to hear frustration beneath her concern. She would say, I ran into Bret at the supermarket. He says the whole office hopes you're doing well. He wants you to know they all think the world of you, and he'd hear, If you're not back soon, they'll cut their losses. She'd kiss him and say, I love you, and he'd hear, I love the man you were before. When can I expect to have him back? Maybe this translation arose from something slightly mechanical in her embraces or the charged pitch of her voice. Or maybe it was just distortion. He hoped for the former, that her frustration was real and not delusion; there was dignity at least in fighting for a marriage; fighting for one's sanity was more precarious. They were approaching their twelfth anniversary, and though he had not spent much time contemplating their relationship in the abstract, he believed that their years together had been happy. Tracy had been an actress before she went to law school, and she had a great talent for entertaining people. In the early years of their marriage, when making...",

It is an approach that thousands of business managers, educators, and government leaders around the world have already adopted with great success. main difficulty of thinking is confusion, writes Edward de Bono, long recognized as the foremost international authority on conceptual thinking and on the teaching of thinking as a skill. We try to do too much at once. Emotions, information, logic, hope, and creativity all crowd in on us. It is like juggling with too many balls. The solution? De Bono unscrambles the thinking process with his six thinking hats: * WHITE HAT: neutral and objective, concerned with facts and figures * RED HAT: the emotional view * BLACK HAT: careful and cautious, the devil's advocate hat * YELLOW HAT: sunny and positive * GREEN HAT: associated with fertile growth, creativity, and new ideas * BLUE HAT: cool, the color of the sky, above everything else-the organizing hat Through case studies and real-life examples, Dr. de Bono reveals the often surprising ways in which deliberate role playing can make you a better thinker. He offers a powerfully simple tool that you-and your business, whether it's a start-up or a major corporation-can use to create a climate of clearer thinking, improved communication, and greater creativity. His book is an instructive and inspiring text for anyone who makes decisions, in business or in life.",

      "abstract": "Called for Life reflects on our calling to serve God and neighbor in the context of retirement. People facing retirement ask a variety of questions, each framed by a different perspective. \"Will I ever be interested in retiring?\" some baby boomers ask. \"Who am I now?\" newly retired clergy ask. \"What, if anything, is God calling me to do and be after retirement?\" all inquire. This book is built on the assumption that most people don't want to spend the last third of their lives doing nothing. What they want is a life that is worth living, an occupation that will help others, and a retirement in which they can continue to exercise their calling. Clayton uses examples from his own experience and from others, laity and clergy, to explore retirement and the three components of our calling: our identity, our gifts, and our occupation. He also examines the role of community in our calling and retirement, the challenges of the transition into retirement, options for meaningful activity, the importance of identifying our purpose, doing and being in retirement, and the final call to death. Readers will be encouraged to see retirement as an opportunity to do what they have always wanted to do and to become the kind of person they have wanted to be.",

This journey has been about more than just tracing my ancestry—it's been a pursuit of clarity, understanding, and self-discovery. In the process, shaped by my surroundings and the current challenges our society faces, I’ve found solace in grounding myself in where I come from. Storytelling holds a profound significance—it transcends generations, preserves legacies, and, at times, is all we have left when everything else fades. Stories connect us, allowing us to share experiences, struggles, and perspectives. Storytelling and writing can also take many different forms, as was my hope with this piece. As a Political Science student minoring in Communications, Spanish, and Women and Gender Studies, I sought to weave a political statement into a narrative inspired by someone incredibly special in my life. At its core, my message is one of empathy—an invitation to step into someone else’s world, to see through their eyes. After all, as the saying goes, you can’t judge someone until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes… or perhaps 200.",

      "title": "Trust me",
      "abstract": "FigureLately, leadership literature and social media attention seem to be focused on trust: rebuilding it, creating foundations of trust, public trust, the \"most trusted\" profession, and other variations on the trust theme. I hadn't thought much about trust since writing on the erosion of just culture after the RaDonda Vaught debacle, and the subsequent pandemic clearly played havoc with organization trust. As it resurfaces as an important issue today, we're faced with building trust from the ground up or risk thriving and positive team dynamics. We also need to trust in our own leaders and organizations. Searching for \"trust in leadership,\" I found testimonials to authenticity, reliability, positivism, and other constructive factors. But what does it mean to have trust in the workplace? It boils down to confidence that an individual, or a group, can be depended on to uphold their role or responsibilities and act in your best interests, or at least consider your best interests. It's knowing your boss and your team have your back. It's believing value-based decisions are made and communications are genuine. You feel \"safe,\" which is the just culture connection. There's an element of ethics involved in terms of moral \"good,\" such as the Gallup \"most trusted\" profession surveys focused on the perception of ethical standards. I reflected on examples of whom I trusted to apply this concept practically. My dentist recently retired and transferred his practice, promising me I'd be in good hands. I trusted his referral; I've been his patient for decades and he always understood me and met my needs. When I was a campus CNO, I trusted my chief nurse executive's decisions for the organization's nursing workforce to be solid and based on best interests. When my team gave me a recommendation for a new hire, I trusted their decision-making would meet our shared objectives. What's the common link? For one, it takes time to develop the foundation of trust; this isn't a one and done. All three had a history with me of sensibility, reliability, and competence. I had positive relationships with all of them. I was confident in their intentions and actions. How does this translate to your practice? Development of a foundation of trust is based on your actions and words. Frequent and transparent communication is a must. Responsiveness is another. Even better is being proactive with issues and not letting them simmer under the surface. Knowing what's simmering is another strategy: no one trusts a leader perceived to be uninformed and out of touch, whether at a team or individual level. Visibility is inherent to being \"in touch.\" These are many of the \"soft skills\" we've discussed as being hard, not soft. Tim Porter O'Grady mentions in a recent Leadership Q&A (Nursing Management, January 2024, p.56) that managers are leading nurses who are peers, not subordinates. This is a profound and important concept in building foundations of trust. Think of that mindset and how it changes the dynamic. Our relationships with our teams shouldn't be about power, hierarchy, and control, they should be about shared goals, respect, and collaboration. Do you feel the same about your leaders and organization: safe, respected, confident? That would be a thriving environment full of engagement and productivity. We wish it for ourselves, as well as building it for our teams. Sometimes I worry about the opposite—being too trusting when it isn't deserved. When it happens, you feel foolish. It's a leadership lesson to learn how to balance and evaluate what you know versus what you hope. This is foundational. Trust me on that.Figure[email protected]",

      "title": "Illness and metaphor: Bonesetting",
      "abstract": "Another year begins. January — long, cold and businesslike — is waiting in the office. Coming back from the holiday I always feel let down, aware of the length of time that stretches before me until spring. There is a new date to get right, but everything else seems just as it was. The patients who were depressed are still depressed, maybe more so. No one has miraculously recovered from dementia or schizophrenia. Illness never takes a holiday. Looking at the charts, I can almost see my patients lined up in neat alphabetical rows, waiting for their turn, just as always.\r\n\r\nYet I know that even if it seems like things will never change, they always do. Twelve months from now, there will be notes in the charts that continue the stories with twists in the plot as yet unwritten and unpredictable. Some of these people will have passed through the door many times; others will have mysteriously disappeared, having been cured or given up and moved on. Each person, by some combination of fate and choice, shapes a life that is never the same, like the river you step into twice. Every day of the year to come, something unexpected will occur. I won't see most of what happens to my patients, only the small part that they tell me. Maybe the unimportant part.\r\n\r\nI hope that the stories will not be interrupted. In psychiatry, patients are not expected to die. A death would probably mean a suicide, something every psychiatrist hopes to avoid as long as possible. But other physicians will look at their charts knowing that some of the people whose stories they contain will not be around for another January. This year will be the last for them, and their charts will open on a final chapter. For many, this may be expected and even accepted. Yet there are others whose lives will change suddenly, so that this time will be remembered as the time before their lives changed, and will seem not just months but thousands of years in the past. But there is always the possibility of cure or relief to balance things out. Bones mend, cancers remit, panic subsides. Children grow. Babies arrive, or get started, and this year will become the year of a birth, the year that will always mark the place where a story began.\r\n\r\nA doctor might like to know where each patient will be at the end of fifty-two weeks. Some much worse, some much better. Some so agonizingly unchanged. A prediction that we call prognosis, heavily seasoned with fate and a tincture of time.\r\n\r\nAmong my rituals of January is hanging up a new calendar. It is a satisfying thing to do. A calendar suggests order. It suggests that time is manageable, controllable. We can book our days according to the time it takes to do our job, whether it's the psychiatrist's fifty-minute hour or a five-hour surgery. Yet, even as we measure time, time measures us. It finds our pulse, numbers our breaths, places us at an unknown location between birth and death. Without prompting, our bodies count the seconds for us, and then the years — so that even when we are not mindful, our blood and our bones keep pace with the passage of time.\r\n\r\nThe practice of medicine leads us to believe we know the body's time. We have figured out how long we should leave the sutures in, how long to stay off an injured foot, how many days a cough should last, even how many weeks form the span of normal sadness. These are the yardsticks against which we measure symptoms. How long have you had this? When did it begin? When was the last time you can remember feeling okay? It tells us a lot about what we can and can't do, to know when the lump appeared, how many years of drinking and smoking there have been, how long the chest pain lasted before it eased.\r\n\r\nBecause we stand outside the stream of illness-time as it engulfs our patients, we can miss the currents that move us. As we watch a patient progress from health to death, it is easy to feel immortal. Are we not still here, unchanged, not a day older, not the slightest bit altered from what we have always been? Until, at the strangest times, something catches us, we look at our bodies, and we realize that we too have been making the journey the whole time.\r\n\r\nBut medicine has taught us that it is not a bad thing that life is short, or that we are getting older. Before I became a doctor I was afraid of illness and death. I thought that being exposed to these conditions on a regular basis might make that fear worse, but instead it has helped. I still don't relish the thought of becoming sick or old, but at least the processes seem more natural. If I remember that I am not exempt, I can be grateful for the time that I have, whether it is fifty years, more, or less. I want to make the most of it and not, as Thoreau said, come to the end of my life only to discover that I have not lived.\r\n\r\nThe turning of the New Year lasts only a moment. Before I realize it, the decorations are back on the shelf by the photocopier and it's mid-January. Resolutions are broken, and things move along as before. The days come quickly, one after another, pushed along by the many small worries that rise and fall like the tide.\r\n\r\nBut, at the strangest times — at the change of the seasons, or on a midsummer night — I get the feeling that comes to me most consistently in the first days of the New Year. The feeling that time has stopped for a moment, or that I have stepped outside of it just long enough to look around. To see where it is that I find myself. To wonder how much time remains. To consider what it is that I want to do now, what it is that I resolve I will become on this New Year's Day.",

      "abstract": "In today’s world, we face a barrage of difficulties in multiple life spheres. While previous times were not without their challenges, these were often restricted to our own personal, geographically localized worlds. Today, news and social media expose us to never-ending reports of traumatic events and interpersonal violence, making us question human nature and our resiliency. Increasing technological advancements have brought forth new challenges, not only in our relationships with technology, but in how we live our daily lives. Financial uncertainty at both the individual and global level raises doubts about our abilities to afford basic necessities. Climate change is wreaking havoc on the environments we call home. Changing interpersonal dynamics present new challenges to personal, social, and group relationships, often resulting in conflict or isolation. Adolescents and young adults are thrust into this confusing world, often lacking the proper resources to understand and cope with these challenges. Adults facing life’s demands also experience extreme stress, with adverse consequences both at the present as well as later life in the form of physical and mental health issues. Furthermore, we have a tendency to direct attention to our individual weaknesses, exacerbating our experience of difficulties. It is, therefore, no wonder that psychology as a discipline, which seeks to understand the human experience, tends to focus on the deficiencies in our lives. However, as stated by Sheldon and King (2001), it is important for psychologists to deviate from this ‘negative bias’, and instead concentrate on positive human qualities and the promotion of what Maslow (1943, 1987) termed growth needs. This focus is the crux of positive psychology.",

Other forms of 'knowing'—such as dance, dream, symphony, play—so that we don't lose touch with unconscious, aesthetic ways of being. The impossibility of sex: a breakdown in male/female sexual relations and the connection here with racial differences, as if the two were interchangeable. The ability to discuss taboo subjects when they appeared in the dreams. An apparent resistance to taking responsibility. The essential acceptance of difference. The healing property of dreams. Often, something is being dreamed which we are afraid to think of when awake. An increasingly paranoid world where certain subjects must be avoided. Projective identification where unacceptable parts of the self are unconsciously projected onto others. The experiential aspect of SD as an antidote to the emptiness of narcissistic, consumerist societies. Lack of hierarchy and competition in SD creating a sense of relatedness and community. The process becomes an end in itself, where truth can be discovered by abandoning the attempt to find it. A realization that the criteria for SD are not based on intellect or education. There are no experts. Everyone has a creative unconscious and can share their dreams if they want to. No expertise is required. No one is marked out of ten or voted 'best dreamer'. Dreams as problem-solving, as they provide ways of thinking outside the confines of the orthodox or ideological. The world we are losing. Dreams as a key to who we are. Animal dreams. Brown dreams. Dreams of kindness. Race and colour. Dreams as vital to our survival.",

Ketika individu ingin melanjutkan sekolah namun biaya tidak ada, sehingga dengan terpaksa harus berhenti sekolah. Untuk sebagian orang hal ini dianggap biasa, tetapi untuk individu yang benar-benar ingin melanjutkan sekolah hal tersebut merupakan masalah yang membuatnya tertekan. Begitu juga yang terjadi dengan S, ia merasa tertekan ketika harus berhenti SMP, sehingga ia sangat sedih, kecewa dan murung. S berusaha untuk bangkit dari keterpurukan agar bisa melanjutkan sekolah lagi. Untuk mampu menjaga kesinambungan hidup yang optimal, maka kebutuhan akan kemampuan untuk menjadi resilien sangat dibutuhkan.\r\nTujuan dilakukan penelitian ini adalah untuk memeroleh gambaran yang mendalam mengenai resiliensi pada mahasiswa yang pernah mengalami putus sekolah.\r\n\r\nResiliensi adalah kemampuan manusia untuk menghadapi, mengatasi, dan menjadi kuat atas kesulitan yang dialaminya. Resiliensi dibutuhkan oleh seseorang agar dapat bertahan dalam menghadapi cobaan serta untuk mempertahankan kehidupan yang baik dan seimbang. Menurut Grotberg ada tiga kemampuan yang membentuk resiliensi. Untuk dukungan eksternal dan sumber-sumbernya, digunakan istilah I Have. Untuk kekuatan individu dalam diri pribadi digunakan istilah I Am, sedangkan untuk kemampuan interpersonal digunakan istilah I Can.\r\nMetode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode kualitatif dengan jenis penelitian deskriptif yang bersifat studi kasus. Teknik pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah wawancara dan observasi dengan jumlah subjek satu orang.\r\nHasil analisa kasus berdasarkan penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa S adalah orang yang resilien karena mempunyai tiga faktor kemampuan yang membentuk menjadi seorang yang resilien yaitu S memenuhi faktor I Have atau dukungan eksternal dalam melanjutkan sekolah, sehingga S mempunyai pondasi untuk menjadi seorang yang resilien ketika mengalami tekanan berupa putus sekolah. S memenuhi faktor I Am atau kekuatan yang berasal dari dalam diri sendiri. S memiliki perasaan untuk mencintai, sikap yang baik dan keyakinan untuk melanjutkan sekolah. Selain itu, S memenuhi faktor I Can atau kemampuan yang dimiliki S untuk mengungkapkan perasaan dan pikiran dalam berkomunikasi dengan orang lain, memecahkan masalah dan mengatur tingkah laku, serta mendapatkan bantuan saat membutuhkannya.",

One cannot do that without wondering about the motivation and reasoning which lies behind what people say; especially if, in a world which does not lack scary or depressing features, the predominant mood is of optimism, idealism and altruism. You may think that this happy state of affairs is as unsurprising as it is welcome. What is so strange about people being moved by idealism or selflessness?

      "title": "Reliving the Trauma Memory in Imagination",
      "abstract": "Abstract In your first session of imaginal exposure, you are going to spend most of the session reliving the memory of your assault in your imagination. It is difficult to understand and make sense of traumatic experiences. When you think about the rape or are reminded of it, you may experience extreme anxiety and other negative feelings such as shame or anger. The assault was a very frightening and distressing experience, so you tend to push away or avoid the painful memories. You may tell yourself, ‘Don’t think about it; time heals all wounds’ or, ‘I just have to forget about it.’ Other people often advise you to use these same tactics. Also, your friends, family, and partner may feel uncomfortable hearing about the assault, and this may influence you not to talk about it. But, as you have already discovered, no matter how hard you try to push away thoughts about the assault, the experience comes back to haunt you through nightmares, flashbacks, phobias, and distressing thoughts and feelings. These symptoms signal us that your assault is still “unfinished business.” In this treatment the goal is to help you process the memories connected with the assault by having you remember them for an extended period of time. Staying with these memories, rather than running away from them, will help decrease the anxiety and fear that are associated with them. It is quite natural to want to avoid painful experiences such as memories, feelings, and situations that remind you of the assault. However, as we already discussed, the more you avoid dealing with the memories, the more they disturb your life. Some of the following examples may help you understand why you need to process the traumatic memories rather than avoiding them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When children lose someone they love, they lose part of their very identity. Life, as they knew it, will never be quite the same. The world that once felt dependable and safe may suddenly seem a frightening, uncertain place, where nobody understands what they’re feeling. In this deeply sympathetic book, Phyllis R. Silverman and Madelyn Kelly offer wise guidance on virtually every aspect of childhood loss, from living with someone who’s dying to preparing the funeral; from explaining death to a two year old to managing the moods of a grieving teenager; from dealing with people who don’t understand to learning how and where to get help from friends, therapists, and bereavement groups; from developing a new sense of self to continuing a relationship with the person who died. Throughout, the authors advocate an open, honest approach, suggesting that our instinctive desire to “protect” children from the reality of death may be more harmful than helpful. “Children want you to acknowledge what is happening, to help them understand it,” the authors suggest. “In this way, they learn to trust their own ability to make sense out of what they see.” Drawing on groundbreaking research into what bereaved children are really experiencing, and quoting real conversations with parents and children who have walked that road, the book allows readers to see what others have learned from mourning and surviving the death of a loved one. In a culture where grief is so often invisible and misunderstood, the wisdom derived from such first-hand experience is invaluable. Filled with compassion and common sense, A Parent’s Guide to Raising Grieving Children: Rebuilding Your Family after the Loss of a Loved One offers readers a wealth of solace and sound advice, and even--where one might least expect it--a measure of hope.",

It can be read from cover to cover, probably most often as a textbook, but lay readers will plot a course through the book that speaks to their individual interests.\n\nOne such course might be: Preface; What you should know and why; Personal considerations and your family history; The threads of your life, explaining basic genetics; The blueprints for life chapters 6-8 (explaining inheritance); Random chapters chosen from chapters 9 to 20, depending on family issues or fears; Aging and longevity; One or more chapters from Avoidance and prevention of genetic disorders if childbearing is a concern; Genes, ethics, law, and public policy; Treatment of genetic disorders.\n\nThe book takes a practical approach, concentrating on the information needed to prevent, avoid, and treat the disorders that may be lurking in your genes. The interaction between genes and the environment is stressed many times. “Studies of several hundred sets of twins from Sweden …",

      "abstract": "To learn anything outside of our usual experience is to try on a new way of being. Doing something new--dealing with change--calls for a commitment to be where you are, to be present in the experiment, even while you are uncertain about the outcome. Being present and committed to the moment is as essential in management or self-management as it is in rowing a boat. How, for instance, can you tell the difference between intuition and fear? In the midst of a crisis, a change, a white water passage, a \"learning opportunity,\" what if you get this gut feeling that something is wrong? If the feeling goes away when you drop into the present, into your body, and \"just row,\" it's not an intuition, it's fear. The opportunity is to know the difference between opinion and intuition, between judgments and experience. Because judgments and opinions carry extraordinarily high price tags.",

      "abstract": "There are lots of ways to think about narrative theory. We might consider the countless casual interactions people have with books, movies, news stories, stump speeches, comics, conversations, and rumors. Whenever someone (on the phone, in a book club, online, or in line at the store) talks about a story's beginning or end, its pacing, the believability or the likability of its characters, he or she is engaging in a kind of narrative theory, an effort to understand particular narratives in relation to assumptions and expectations that govern either some kinds of narrative or narratives in general. We might also consider more professional efforts to understand or to evaluate narratives, the work and writing of critics and academics who make their livings assessing or analyzing stories either in terms of particular aesthetic, social, or political values or in terms of the expectations and ideas that circulate at a given moment in time. We might think here of the film critic who sees every film in a season and so can say with authority what films work best and why; or of the think-piece blogger who looks at a handful of contemporary novels in order to see how the war on terror or the new ubiquity of social media affects the way we tell stories now; or of the literary critic who reads Renaissance drama or Victorian fiction in order to identify how history's different ideas and practices shape the form and content of narratives (how Elizabethan stage design limits or conditions the beginnings and ends of plays, how serialization affects thinking about suspense, how culturally specific ideas about death and dying affect thinking about the possibility of closure, and so on). These are also theories of narrative, attempts to understand both the role that narratives play in particular cultures at particular times and the shaping effects that a culture's assumptions and beliefs have on the development and evaluation of narrative as such.",

The story is an adventure, an autobiography disguised as fiction, in which the hero/heroine hides crucial intrapsychic conflicts, mysteries, screen memories of actual traumatic events and the resolution of these elements into a happy ending, best celebrated by orgasm. The function of the fantasy is to take these painful experiences and convert them to pleasure—triumph. In order to sharpen excitement—the vibration between the fear of original traumas repeating and the hope of a pleasurable conclusion this time— one introduces into the story elements of risk (approximations of the trauma) meant to prevent boredom and safety factors (subliminal signals to the storyteller that the risks are not truly dangerous). Sexual fantasy can be studied by means of a person's daydreams (including those chosen in magazines, books, plays, television, movies, and outright pornography), masturbatory behavior, object choice, foreplay, techniques of intercourse, or postcoital behavior.",

      "abstract": "Roland Barthes suggests that from his past it is his childhood which ‘fascinates’ him most; ‘…it is not the irreversible I discover in my childhood, it is the irreducible: everything which is still in me, by fits and starts; in the child, I read quite openly the dark underside of myself – boredom, vulnerability, disposition to despairs (in plural, fortunately), inward excitement, cut off (unfortunately) from all expression.’ (Barthes, 1977).  The child as Other is an adult construct - a fantasy, but also a reality in that she/he is a psychological reflection of the adult world – summoned up from memory, history, revisited and revised – a reflection of loss, of difference. Or, as Jacqueline Rose suggests: ‘…childhood is something in which we continue to be implicated and which is never simply left behind. Childhood persists…’ (Rose, 1992).  Cinema has a long history of re –presenting the image of the child/childhood as Other on the screen – multiple, contradictory, mythical images, often difficult to negotiate – contentious depictions of the innocent (tabula rasa), of the monstrous (the bodies or sexuality of the prepubescent female child becoming the site of Kristeva’s/Creed’s notions of the abject) - recurrent motifs, themes, patterns which filmmakers appear to recycle from film to film.   This paper aims to explore the ways in which some cinema has attempted to engage the child/childhood as Other in a more equal discourse. Jane Campion, Victor Erice, and Abbas Kiarostami have all produced cinematic images which seem to draw the Otherness of the child out from the margins. Through their negotiations with form and content these filmmakers appear to meet the Other in a manner similar to the way in which some writers engage with l’ecriture feminine.",

      "title": "Revolution and Reaction",
      "abstract": "Abstract WHY oo people rebel? Our instinctive answer is, because they find their lives intolerable. But this is obviously no answer at all: not only is it circular, it ignores the unhappy truth that, while intolerable conditions are common, rebellions are rare. Suffering alone is not enough; it is a necessary but not a sufficient cause for revolution. Before they rebel, those who suffer must believe, if only for a short time, that their rebellion will lead to a better life for themselves or their communities. Only in this belief can people find the courage to act, the strength to break the bonds of habit and run the risks rebellion inevitably involves. By itself, suffering will not provide this strength and courage; indeed, suffering is more likely to weaken and demoralize than to incite and inspire. Revolutions are rare because they require an unusual conjunction of suffering and hope, a sense of outrage and an act of faith. To understand the great mid-century revolutions, therefore, we must bear in mind not only the social and political crises that inflicted hardships on so many during the 1840s but also the sense of hope and possibility that simultaneously reverberated through¬ out Europe. Everywhere we look in 1846 and 1847 we find expressions of faith-in thespecial parliaments summoned by the kings of Wilrttemberg, Prussia, and Saxony, in the meetings of professional groups and scholarly societies, in cafes and taverns, city halls and bureaucratic offices, lecture halls and students’ rooms.",

The man who hated irony scorned the critics who held this trope above all others; just as he loathed his so-called friends sniggering behind his back as he moved from one unhappy romance to another, conﬁdent that they understood his weakness for needy but withholding lovers better than he did, and reading his compulsions as some variety of Fate. Could life know more about the living than the living knew about themselves? Perhaps. But it still didn’t make it right. Knowledge should be universal or not known at all. He came to believe secrets were the cause of war: each side protecting itself against its ignorance of the other. If only knowledge wasn’t limited to the privileged few we could live in peaceful harmony or at least subject to the same forces of chance. The way he saw it, the inequalities of knowledge were worse than the inequalities of wealth, but given Wall Street was no more than an insider’s game, 1 2 5 R there was little to choose between them. He welcomed government surveillance of his emails if that would mean a level playing ﬁeld where he and the titans of ﬁnance would be forced to reveal themselves simultaneously.

He scorned playwrights who gave to their audiences an understanding to which the actors were blind. Would someone for once get up at the start of Oedipus and ﬁll the lead in: ‘‘For god’s sake, it’s you. who’s causing the plague. It’s not your fault, for how were you to know the rash actions of your youth would come back and bite you.’’ But why are we so sure that Oedipus is the culprit? Couldn’t it be that some toxin is polluting the city? heavy metals from the blacksmith’s forge somehow seeping into the ground water, a scientiﬁc explanation that Sophocles ignored because he was so pu√ed up with pride? Perhaps, he concluded, the greatest irony would be that we were mistaken all along, taken in by Tiresias’ jumble of gossip and jealousy and that we should be the ones packing out bags and gouging out our eyes while Jocasta and the king prepare for a slow dance at Antigone’s wedding? ...",

Delineations in time and space promise a challenge that is not unending or uncontrollable, and creates a potential for the situation to be approached as play. For confusion and disorientation to be exciting rather than terrifying, it is essential that the subject or participant has a sense of agency, and has entered – and can exit – the situation of his or her free will. For the state of confusion to be motivating and pleasurable, it is also important that there is a potential for resolution. \r\nThe challenge presented by a riddle can in itself be stimulating, provided the participant feels that there is a reasonable chance that he or she can solve it. Enough clues need to be present to create at least the promise of a narrative, pattern, or otherwise cohesive picture to discover. But if too much of the picture is filled in, there is not enough uncharted territory to stimulate heuristic inquiry, or an internally driven search to know. The balance between the seeming promise of a resolution or cohesive narrative, and the metaphorical gaps left open for the participant to bridge by his or her own physical and/or cognitive efforts, is crucial to how motivating or attractive the situation is to the participant.",

Families are torn apart and nations are torn asunder. Violence breeds further violence and isolation through lack of access to justice in some contexts, and legal measures to physically detain marginalized people and that isolate them further in others. We recede into ourselves and sit alone behind our prison walls. We become little more than numbered ghosts. Rarely do we reach to aspects of our heritage(s), sit down together and embrace one another.I would like to convey this notion of prison by utilizing the chair a symbol of repose while the rest of the world keeps going. Chairs are an absolute necessity in modern civilization. They often signify a space of security, respite, settlement, and a level of comfort. We can get trapped within the framework of our subjective lives and we forget to breathe, we forget to talk, we forget to touch. We begin to formulate our own personal prisons barricading ourselves from the rest of humanity.I will display an instillation featuring figures (casted from male, female, young, old) sculpted from plaster in various poses. There will be many pairs of figures interacting with their chairs (sitting down, praying, contemplating, etc.) but the figures will be isolated from each other by a series of walls/doors. These walls/doors will address both the physical institution of prison as well as the prisons we build around ourselves so that we are no longer capable of reaching out to one another.",

In this, they feel that they are getting satisfaction instead of they are more unsatisfied. For this unrest they blame and abuse others and even sometime abuse themselves in the form of self-hatred and guilt. Mind management is the deliberate and conscious direction of thoughts in the knowledge that each individual thought has an effect and creates the reality in which we live. We should look at thoughts as being things that possess energy. Positive energy is better for us than negative energy. Mind management allows us to harness our minds to develop our full potential and achieve our goals. We can choose our thoughts and control our mind. We have the natural ability to cancel any thought that does not support us. We can also install self-empowering thoughts at anytime by choosing to focus on them. Bhagwadgita teach us to control our mind. Bhagwadgita says that our mind is our best friend or enemy also. When we manage our thought our mind automatically manages and achieve success in every field of life. What we think about ourselves becomes the truth for us. Every thought we think is creating our future. Each one of us creates our experiences by our thought and our feeling. The thoughts we think and the words we speak creates our experiences. We create the situation, and then give our power away by blaming the other person for our frustration. No person, no place and nothing has any power over us, for “we” are the only thinkers in our mind. When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.",

The fundamental cause of the alienation is the modern view of world which still dominates the consciousness of modern people. In this paper, the possible ways of making happy old age through practice are investigated.<BR> Two kinds of aging through practice is discussed in this paper. The first is aging as practice through physical health problems. The second is aging as practice through social loss. In the first part, aging as practice through aging phenomenon, death, and disease is covered. In the second part, aging as practice through loss of social relation and economic loss is stated.<BR> In the next chapter, the image of beautiful old age is depicted. The heart of beautiful old age overflows with love. He thanks to everything and everybody. He is humble. He always stays in the lower place like water. His mind is peaceful. Nothing can disturb his peace. He is free from the obsession over money and power. His mind is receptive. He is open and can receive everything like earth. He helps everything which needs help.<BR> In this paper, aging as practice is discussed. The sociological and practical implication of this paper is as follows. First, the way of beautiful and happy aging can be suggested. Second, the image of happy and beautiful old age can be provided.

The intimacy constitutive of friendship creates a space in which the friends can be their ‘authentic’ selves together. Within a friendship, we are specific selves that we are only able to be within the private space of that relationship, selves that play a crucial role in the narratives of our lives. Disloyalty, then, poses a threat to the private space of the friendship, and, thus, to the self that is party to that friendship. Although disloyalty to a friend can be more costly than disloyalty to one’s country, the cost to the self of the betrayal of a friend does not in itself settle how one ought to act in such cases of conflict.",

Having lots of ideas looks like you really are very creative and that you must posses very special talents more than anybody else around you. Often you are praised for being so highly creative and so smart, that you indulge yourself in all kinds of happy thoughts about how good you are consequently daydreaming about having many more ideas in the future. We believe that anybody can be creative and has the capacity to have ideas or think thoughts that if brought to bear are so creative and ingenious that we could become envious of such a person. Our hypothesis is that if you could externalize ideas with the aid of computational machines and bring out the creative act in harmonized and holistic ways such that people can benefit and gain from it. Sharing and spreading your ideas, showing creativity without being inhibited, having confidence to open yourself up and feel free to convey your thoughts no matter how 'ridiculous' it may sound has an immediate affect on people's behavior, self-esteem and psychological condition. Creativity, imagination and inspiration go together well with doing, taking action and being motivated to carry on.",

The downside is that we are more thoughtless, and we are not fully present as the attention we have available is more superficial. At the same time, the seriousness of our environmental and social planetary challenges requires that we change almost everything we are used to: our way of consuming, producing, moving around and entertaining, to name a few. For this to take place, however, individuals need to become aware of their own behaviors, values and purpose. And this cannot happen on the run. In this chapter an exercise will be presented that invites students to have an unusual experience of being with themselves, in solitude, to do nothing, in nature. This powerful exercise leads students to see themselves in a new way, also experience nature differently, and a rich variety of unexpected thoughts about their purpose, their goals, habits, pace of life or addiction to technology emerge, as excerpts of their reflective posts illustrate.",

      "title": "Introduction: Fictions About Fatherhood",
      "abstract": "Introduction:Fictions About Fatherhood Claudia Nelson (bio) Today's newspaper headlines and magazine articles reflect a world in which fathers barely exist. We read about the father so wrapped up in his work that he knows no details of his children's lives; the sexually abusive father who makes home not haven but horror; the \"deadbeat dad\" who, living apart from his family, refuses to help support his children; even (in these biotechnological days) the man who insists upon the destruction of his ex-wife's fertilized ova so that fatherhood can't be forced upon him. Men, says society, are afraid of commitment; although our personal experience may contradict the rumor, we hear that marriage is dying and fatherhood well-nigh dead. Clearly our culture feels considerable anxiety about fatherhood—an anxiety that long predates the supermarket self-help book and the network talk show. We can trace the rise of this concern, as we can follow so many cultural obsessions, in the pages of literature for children, a genre that is of course designed in part to explain to its young readers their position within the family and the larger world. The fathers described in the children's stories of the pre-industrial era are not merely reassuringly responsible; more, they are at the center of the family instead of on the periphery. Following the Old Testament pattern that establishes the father-son relationship as paramount (just as God creates Adam first, the patriarchs often seem to measure their worth in terms of the number of boys they sire), religious and rationalist texts for children alike depict the father as firmly in control and warmly interested in his offspring's development. Sons, especially, reap the benefits of older men's expertise both worldly and moral. We have only to recall Mr. Fairchild's efforts with little Henry—and, to a lesser extent, Henry's sisters—in The Fairchild Family, or contemplate the spate of stories about the tutelage of boys (Émile, for instance, or Sandford and Merton), to discover a world in which fatherhood or surrogate fatherhood seems enviably unproblematic. There is seldom a suggestion in these books that Father might not know best; not only does he know more about morality and plain good sense than do his children, he generally knows more about childrearing than does his wife. As Jani L. Berry observes in her article in this issue on Jacob Abbott's Rollo books, this vision of the domestic realm went hand in hand with a conviction that order is a cardinal virtue. As the head of the family, the father derives his authority from God; in a sense he takes God's place for his wife and children, not only insofar as he provides for them, but also insofar as he must serve as moral arbiter and teacher. Especially for his sons, he is required to be both overseer and role model so that in due course they may take his place, reproducing the pattern. Should he abdicate this duty by excessive severity or excessive laxness, commentators during this period warn, chaos will result. The precarious balance of the day depends upon respect for properly constituted authority. But the world was changing, and the father's role within the family changing with it. With the advent of industrialization, fewer and fewer men worked within the home, and the values of the marketplace began to seem inimical to those of domesticity; inevitably, as fathers spent less time with their sons, they were increasingly depicted as a species of amphibian, dividing their time between the antithetical spheres of public and private life. Simultaneously, the mother began to take over the father's erstwhile role as guardian of the middle-class family's morality. What is sometimes styled the \"golden age\" of children's writing, the period commencing with the publication of Alice in Wonderland in 1865 and closing with that of Peter Pan in 1911, is also a low point for the fictional father; the most he can hope for seems to be ineffectuality. Take a look at paternity in some milestones of American children's literature from this period: Mr. March is merely a less...",

The lyrics of the song convey the group's identity as a survivor who defied the stigmas and stereotypes assigned to them as a result of a broken relationship. Domestic violence victims try to maintain this sense of normalcy. However, sometimes due to society's rules and regulations, the domestic victims feel, and in some cases are, stigmatized. Society places a large stigma on domestic violence victims. Domestic violence survivors can feel stigmatized, because others do not understand the circumstances that surround a survivor's experiences. Domestic violence victims can be stigmatized under the category, because many believe a person is flawed if she stays in an abusive relationship.",

But the particular definition I am about to perpetrate is the result of a few recent experiences of mine, after delivering addresses dealing with library affairs. An optimist is a person whose pessimism is of that profound order that he dare not seriously consider anything which is likely to weaken his optimism. He feels that he must meet any such thing by airily waving it away, and crying in a loud voice: Pessimist! Like Cassius “such men are dangerous,” but for precisely the opposite reason to Caesar's, not because they “think too much,” but because they refuse to think at all. It is the childish belief, to which most of us are prone at times, that if you decline to look at a thing, it isn't there. You who are young are necessarily natural optimists—if you're not, it's a case for a doctor—but your optimism, being probably more instinctive than defensive, should enable you to consider calmly and intelligently any reasoned statement of difficulties and dangers which may, or which do lie ahead of the libraries. And you will not assume that anyone who points these out, because he points them out, believes that the difficulties will not be surmounted, and that the dangers will certainly materialise. If forewarned is not always forearmed, the tiger in the path is surely less formidable if his presence is known, and even if there is discovered to be no tiger, there is no particular harm done by a little wary looking out.",

We have Jeong for the mother we know or do not know; we have Jeong for the country of our birth as we do for the breath in our bodies, and for these reasons, Jeong is responsible for both acts of great tenderness and violence . For Jeong, we can wage violence on behalf of something akin to tenderness. With Jeong, there is no separation between what is good or bad—only the deepest feeling that compels us to save our souls. Therefore, there is no difference between a pastor and a dictator. They are both sick with their own Jeong and soothed by it. Using Jeong, we can enter Lee’s characters ’ lives with reverence. Yongju is not a self-pitying exile, but rather he is inordinately tough—an identity composed of both self-flagellation and heroism. Jangmi is not a scrappy slave, but she is godly for aggregating worth to her life for each day she survives it. Danny’s emotions do not belong to himself, but they are a tribute to his worldliness and empathy. Yongju forgiving Jangmi can be attributed to his Jeong as much as Jangmi’s contemplating suicide from a windowsill can belong to Jeong. To read with reverence, not neglect, we can understand that these characters are a microcosm not only of the North Korean crisis but of the whole of our humanity. As Americans, we cannot share the experience of living in North Korea. But as humans, we can feel what it is to lose willpower , to be brutalized, to condemn one’s world, country, and self. Though experiences are unique, emotions are universal. It may be common to look at traitors in terms of traitors in the book armed with gun or Bible—traitors that live in another place we do not feel responsible for. But I dare to ask this question: How much are we, as humans, traitors to ourselves? When confronted with this question, we are not confused by the word traitors. We are confused by the word ourselves. When we begin to think of “I” as plural, though we live in a society that embraces the word “I,” we dare to see and act from a place of reverence. We call it love, but we cannot transform as shown by Lee’s characters through love alone. We must question our Jeong, the deepest parts that choose what we stand for when no one is watching , then act. The greatest inhumanity in the book is not the torture, betrayal, and slaughter. It is the silence that follows the end. It is the contemplation that this is not a story to be shelved and, at best, reviewed on paper. In another space, beyond the characters and the questions they offer, what’s left is achingly bright: inhumanity forced upon others ends the moment we know them as ourselves.

      "title": "Ambivalence in the World Risk Society",
      "abstract": "Risk is most often associated with danger and perceived as a harmful aspect of life, as an insidious and unwelcome threat that should be avoided. Risk-taking, however, is sometimes a singular passion, a source of pleasure that becomes a way of life. When freely pursued as a valorised activity, it can be a path to self-fulfilment, an opportunity to confront new situations, and a means for redefining one’s self, testing personal abilities, increasing self-esteem or gaining recognition. Deliberate risk-taking is a form of character building. It accommodates life’s intensities. It is extremely popular in high-risk physical activities and sports and postmodern forms of adventure.",

Decisions that involve outcomes at different points in time are referred to as inter-temporal choices. Some of these decisions may turn out to be irrelevant, while others may significantly shape our future. Even when the outcomes of our choices are uncertain, our inter-temporal decision-making tendencies, whether long or short term, can significantly affect our lives over time.",

      "title": "Earning Our Children's Trust",
      "abstract": "Earning Our Children's Trust Walter Dean Myers (bio) We trust children when they're first born. Perhaps it's because they respond so easily to our love and attention, and don't question us too closely. We lose that trust somewhere along the time they start talking. Then we tolerate them, most often love them still, and occasionally allow them to entertain us with their concerns. Trusting them is another matter. To begin with, we doubt the intellectual capability of the child who says that he or she wants a nuclear free world. When children suggest that we can, as rational beings in a rational, mostly civilized world, simply talk out our differences, we question their maturity. Nor do we trust their capacity for sustained logic when they say that if people on one side of the world don't want war and people on the other side don't want war there's really no need to have a war. What we end up doing is giving our wars with the regularity of Saturday night dances and casting suspicious glances at the children who think we're out of our minds. We're probably right not to trust children because basic to the child's world is the concept of free will. Free will is often embarrassing, if not downright unpleasant for adults to consider. Not so for children. Children tend to think that we, being adults, are perfectly free to exercise our wills to accomplish those things we say we believe in. It baffles them when we profess love but zealously guard our stores of hate; when we celebrate universal justice while talking of \"acceptable\" levels of oppression. We confuse children even further when we tell them how fervently we want peace as we pass yet another huge military budget to insure it, knowing full well that the \"other side\" will have to pass an equally huge military budget to keep their version of the \"peace.\" We really confound children as we champion the cause of democracy by supplying arms to dictators. We've got one thing going for us, though. Somewhere between childhood and adulthood we teach a great many children to think like adults. We're even able to convince them that their children should not be trusted. As writers we face no more formidable task than to bring children and adults together. We need to see the world clearly and to explain it [End Page 21] clearly to children so that they, in turn, can explain it back to us without our adult compromises, and without our adult excuses. To do less is to abandon our talents, perhaps even our universe. If we're lucky, we might even get children and adults to trust each other again. If we're lucky.

Preconstructing the future is as important as reconstructing the past and should be just as respectable. The manager makes his five- or ten-year plans; the scientist makes his predictions; the husband takes out life insurance; the housewife makes budgets; the prophet foretells; the trusting soul hopes. All of these expectations can be right or wrong, as time will tell. But so can be all the world’s history books, the biographies of significant people, the reflections we have about our fathers and grandfathers and family trees. And, as clinicians know, we can be very wrong about the past by the selective memories and screen memories that each of us entertains about his own personal life. The look forward is no more prone to error than the look backward - both can be guided by secondary process thought or thwarted by primary process manifestations.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reflects on the importance of remembering and commemorating disasters. For all affected by these tragic events, significant anniversaries are in part about reconciling and assimilating the past into their everyday lives. For some, the passage of time means that the tenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth anniversaries can represent an opportunity to look forward; for others, personal loss and the fact that fundamental questions about these events remain unanswered and unaddressed mean that notions such as 'moving on' or 'letting go' are simplistic and unhelpful. The challenge for those organising and conducting commemorative events after collective tragedy is to ensure that moving on does not mean moving away from the connection with the tragedy. Commemorations need to be inclusive in order to avoid individual survivors or bereaved, or the wider community, feeling that their loss and experience are somehow lesser, or not recognised; the whole point of commemoration is to feel validated. When thoughtfully considered, the way in which permanent memorials and memorial services are designed and conducted can embrace the sense of remembering the unique character and loss of individuals within the collective experience of disaster.",

It's a matter of bad luck if you arrive the day after a chief has died; better luck if you stumble on a violent row or a wedding negotiation. Hindsight smooths the transitions, imposes a design, makes the contingent necessary. But this is an illusion, for the anthropologist – unlike the novelist, who can order events and invent characters – is at the mercy of chance. The only continuity is autobiographical. Sometimes, however, an unexpected event – it need not be calamitous – disrupts the routines of village life and makes you aware, if not of a governing pattern, at least of a rearrangement. The dust settles and you realize you are standing in a different place. Others, too, may feel this change: nobody has moved, but by a shift of perspective, the picture, quite suddenly, looks different.",

Psychotherapists have less autonomy now than we did 25 years ago because mental health services are more regulated by managed care. Although the increased accountability is a crucial benefit for client care, the emphasis on symptom relief can be a disservice. Certainly there are some identifiable symptoms that can be extinguished, but often the wounds of life include grief, loss, relationship traumas, and other kinds of pain. Sometimes the limits of change and the pain that is part of life must be accepted. I have been influenced by experiences in rural Africa and in underserved communities in the United States about the value of social and cultural factors in psychotherapy relationships as well.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Is your self-confidence already soaring? Then you needn’t read this chapter. (The best maxim is: If it’s working well, don’t tinker with it!) Those of you who wish to continue, gather round with those singers who do, from time to time, suffer from self-doubt. Explaining self-confidence is almost unnecessary. In some singers it is visible for all to see, so obvious that it is very nearly tangible-in the waythey look, walk, and talk, what they say, and even the very thoughts they think. But did you ever think of confidence in the following way? Confidence is the assuredness that comes from feeling equal to the task you are about to complete, an assuredness usually characterized by unshakable belief in yourself and your ability. In practical singers’ terms, it is the serenity of knowing that even your worst four bars are going to be pretty good. You probably know some who fit this description. Their selfbelief is truly unalterable, and their egos resist the severest misfortunes. They appear very resilient, bouncing back like a rubber ball-the harder it’s hit, the quicker it bounces back. Remember Muhammad Ali? “I’m the greatest,” he kept saying. He carried this aura around with him, and in the end, even his opponents believed that he was indeed the greatest. The same with Tiger Woods’s golf performance in 1997: “I was in between a Band a C[in my playing].",

He knew that Big Boy must leave home, that Mann must die trying to escape, that Silas must fight, that the Reverend Taylor must feel the imminence of death, not because their lives were determined by social, political, or any other external forces, but because the racist circumstances in which Blacks live give rise to these acts and because they were representative figures -alienated from themselves by their experiences of themselves as objects in the sight of the existential Other. They all embody the agonizing experiences of Black people in the United States. Bigger, Black Boy, Cross, freddaniels, Saul-they, too, are representative figures. But each of these characters holds within himself the feeling of being a discrete entity, of being something other than that which others see him as being. In other words, each of them feels or comes to feel he is an individual in his own right, by reason of his own experiences and choices. Each reveals, implicitly, an attempt to live authentically, to recognize the existence and demands of moral freedom.",

Our egos have an interesting impact on our perception of our truth, causing us sometimes to feel too self-assured and sometimes not assured enough. This can certainly get in the way of recognizing our truth. The DiSC is grounded in William Marston's 1930s model, with dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness representing the four behavioral styles. The best way to experience DiSC is to take an own assessment. When we accept our situation by looking at it objectively, rather than resisting it, we can be open rather than closed.",

As such, our greatest asset is our ability to quickly find acceptance among the parties, offer conduits for discussion and debate, and establish pathways to achieve resolution. Further, we must achieve all of these without damaging the ongoing relationship between the factions within the organization.

      "abstract": "FigureFigureMost souls are searching for peace, but relatively few find it. To suggest a solution in brief anecdotes might trivialize the problem and sound cliché. What impresses me—what changes me—is the realization that so many people are in so much pain. Pain, it seems, is the lowest common denominator in humanity. Pain, more than anything else, makes us all alike. What tears us apart is the naïve arrogance of thinking our own situation—our own brand of pain—is somehow different, somehow more important than someone else's. Pain is what I see so often in ED patients. I've cared for alcoholics, workaholics, drug addicts, compulsive gamblers, and sex addicts. I've taken care of abusers and the victims of abuse, and the parents, children, and siblings of each. I often wonder about the pain that afflicts us all, that makes us one. Sometimes it's nothing more or less than a spiritual homesickness, a gnawing spiritual hunger for the divine glory we once enjoyed. Sometimes, of course, it is much more. Sometimes it's a frank and deep-seated depression requiring expert medical intervention. But when it is spiritual loneliness and we see that longing in one another, the cure becomes obvious. After 20 years in the ED, I sat with a tearful young man who admitted that he just didn't know how to deal with the pain any longer. The first anniversary of his brother's untimely death had just passed. The grief interfered with his work, his relationships, and his ability to function. He had nowhere to go and no one to help him. He felt as though no one could understand. He felt absolutely alone. I knew little of the young man's life and nothing of his religious background. I knew, however, that he was in pain. I had an inkling of what he needed. His whole countenance changed when he heard me say, “I remember how I felt when my brother died.” As I shared a few simple thoughts and feelings, his tears stopped, his back straightened, and his shoulders squared, as though an unseen physical burden was being lifted. I hadn't taken his problem away. I couldn't do that. All I did was offer a little perspective and the realization that he was not as alone as he thought. As I spoke, hope returned to his face and confidence to his eyes. I hadn't learned such treatment in medical school. I learned it from the souls who wandered in and out of my life. I ordered no labs or x-rays. He needed no medication. All he needed was someone who cared. The fact that I could speak from experience helped, but the common thread was pain and the common cure compassion. In that way, to the extent we are willing, we can all heal one another. The mist of darkness and the pains of life are inevitable. They are on the path we all must tread. Trying to avoid them through drugs, alcohol, sexual exploitation, or any number of other destructive behaviors only takes us away from the ultimate happiness we truly desire and the rewards that await an authentic life. All the distractions and substitutes are temporary. Love and empathy are real and eternal.",

To question this need does not mean to resist it, but on the contrary to give into it even while trying to learn from it, to let oneself be guided by this impulse, but, one hopes, not too blindly. Thanks to the incomparable vision and devotion of Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, who collected fourteen texts Derrida wrote, as he writes, ‘following the death’ of a friend, we, his friends, are now able, if indeed we are able, to follow him in too many senses of that word, including the most painful one: just following the death of the friend.",

They believe that at the end of life there is a tallying, some metaphysical accountant who totals up their contributions, deducts their bad acts, and creates the (hopefully positive) difference That difference, they believe, is their “legacy ” But the thought that legacy arrives at the end of life is as ridiculous as someone who decides to sell a business and tries to increase its valuation the day prior Legacy is now Legacy is daily Every day we create the next page in our lives, but the question becomes who is writing it and what’s being written Is someone else creating our legacy? Or are we, ourselves, simply writing the same page repeatedly? Or do we leave it blank? Our organic, living legacy is marred and squeezed by huge normative pressures There is a “threshold” point, at which one’s beliefs and values are overridden by immense peer pressure Our metrics are forced to change In an age of social media, biased press, and bullying, we’ve come to a point where our legacy, ironically, is almost out of our hands Yet our “meaning” - our creation of meaning and not a search for some illusive alchemy - creates worth and impact for us and all those with whom we interact © 2021 Taylor & Francis",

      "title": "Territoriality in Rhetoric",
      "abstract": "Through discourse we seek reassurance, appreciation, respect, and assistance, test and refine self-image, announce desires, fears, and disappointments, and negotiate our daily affairs. Yet rhetorical theory and theory and methods of instruction have kept at a distance the and psychological concerns these actions suggest-consigning them to the realm of expressive discourse and emotional appeal or placing them outside the study of discourse entirely. The reasons are interesting. Perhaps, as James Kinneavy remarks, is easy to take the expressive component of language for granted precisely because it is so fundamental (394). But we have also been quite naturally reluctant to cross the line between discourse theory and counseling. Attributes of personality like composure and aggressiveness, openness and self-effacement, or evasiveness and self-pity seem more readily the province of therapy and maturation than rhetoric or the teaching of writing-however important they might be to our appreciation or distaste for an author's opinions. Part of the answer lies, as well, in our attitude towards expressiveness. The connotations are bad. We associate expressive aims with pointless effusion and self-indulgence. They represent to us not productive goals but impositions on the audience, unjustified by useful content. We equate and psychological with all that we teach students to avoid: with confessional and egocentric writing, with preconceptions and unsupported judgments, and with essays that sound good but say nothing. We see the dark side of expressivenessintimidation, self-promotion, and attention-seeking at its worst-and in the interest of suppressing it may discourage more positive rhetorical stances. The difference between well-founded assertiveness and intellectual bullying can be difficult, after all, to discern. It is similarly possible to dismiss as childish attention-seeking a legitimate demand for due respect. We also suppress these social motives (by which I mean both individual and communal aims) because they are dangerous to admit. Authors who invite appreciation are likely to receive disdain. Articulating too explicitly the importance of an idea-even when the claim is justified-can seem like egotism. Admitting uncertainty inspires neglect. Despite all that can be gained from humanizing the author's persona in discourse, the risks are so great that we generally prefer to erect barriers of formality, reserve, abstraction, and indirection",

      "abstract": "The Past Danica Li (bio) Click for larger view View full resolution Photo by Daisyree Bakker [End Page 140] My new boyfriend and I have been fighting a lot recently. We've only been dating for six months or so, so it's to be expected, I suppose, that things will come out, aspects of the other's personality previously concealed or ignored, strange living habits, uncontrollable facial tics, troubled relations with one's mother, preferences for whole-grain mustard or Dijon, etc. I've been surprised by the theme of these arguments, although I suppose they aren't arguments per se. That would imply that our conversations lack civility, intent facial expressions indicating active listening, measured and thoughtful responses. Still, the fundamental thing about these conversations is that we can't agree. We start far apart, and after an evening spent going back and forth, nodding thoughtfully at the other's point of view, presenting our own, invoking [End Page 141] our piecemeal knowledge of the relevant fields of academic study—sociology, biology, epistemology, phenomenology, zoology, and all the rest—we always find ourselves farther apart than before. Anyway, as I was saying, I was surprised by the theme of our disagreements when we started disagreeing, which was back a month ago—or so I think; my sense of time has become so strange and collapsible these days. I'm a client relationships coordinator at a big, faceless conglomerate that has a lot of clients and therefore a lot of client relationships to coordinate. Coordination is not my passion, but it pays well. One evening we had a client dinner at which I was expected to be present, hosted at an upscale restaurant near the waterfront, everything on the company's tab. I invited Evan, my boyfriend, to be my plus one, thinking, what the heck, it would be a fun date night. Maybe we could sneak away and make out under the potted palms. At that point we still didn't know each other very well, so that was still something which excited us to do. Well, first of all, sneaking away proved impossible, as we were seated in a booth that looked out onto the water, which was a pretty view indeed, but we were trapped at the very end of the booth, with people sitting practically stacked on top of us, and to get out we would've had to crawl out under the table or climb over people's laps. Second, we managed to get seated next to some interesting people. I don't know what my manager was thinking; maybe she had such faith in my relationshipcoordination skills that she thought this was a smart move, to put me there, so I could groom these people for business development purposes. That or she had created the seating arrangement from strips of names mixed up in a party hat while drunk in her office. So it was I, my boyfriend, next to me, and, across the table, this couple that had, as publicity would say, a \"high visibility quotient,\" even as they sat there saying nothing to each other or to any of the others. The reason they had a high visibility quotient was because the woman was young and so beautiful as to be radiant, really like a sun bursting out from behind clouds, while her husband was old and ugly and, judging from the way he was dressed, extremely rich. Looking at the woman was quite uncomfortable, for me and for Evan, though I suspect for different reasons. She was one of those people who instantly put you in mind of your own physical inferiority. Her husband, on the other hand, had the opposite effect, of reassuring you that however you looked, at least you didn't look like that. The contrast between the two was quite jarring and made me feel, I'm not sure why, bad for us all. [End Page 142] Anyway, here we were, the lot of us sitting there with our appetizers and drinks rimmed with salt and served with green lime wedges in case the drinks lacked adequate acidity, and I determined to make small talk, as...",

      "abstract": "The present economic status of the people of the world is the result of disobedience of the “Golden Rule.” Some may challenge this statement, nevertheless I am prepared to let it stand. The remedy for the depressed conditions rests with us as individuals, families, communities, states or provinces, and nations. The individual must get his own house in order; the rest will follow naturally. You can, without stretching the imagination too greatly, visualize a group, a city, or a country made up of persons, each planning, conniving, even fighting for all he can corral for himself without thought of his neighbors. This self-centered existence has been in evidence too long. The ego must go. Our social service clubs are waving banners with high-sounding mottoes, but are the personnel of these clubs living in accordance with their preachings? It is not all economic either; one's mental attitude during the depression has made it difficult to distinguish or assess the value of those things necessary or worth-while, as compared with what was enjoyed in the days of prosperity or what propagandists have proclaimed as our rights. Wars, capital-labor differences, bitter contentions between political parties, religious organizations at variance, all have at the root of their strife selfish motives—coupled, it is true, with misunderstandings and mismanagement. Let us face this mess with real courage, a determination that we are prepared to do our bit in the reconstruction and re-establishment of world affairs upon a more equitable basis; friendly co-operation, live and let live, and that we are starting right now. “Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.” How can the members of the Radiological Society of North America apply such a Rule to their specialty? 1. Our Patients.—We should place ourselves in the position of the patients, conduct such examinations and treatments as seem desirable or necessary, in other words, work 100 per cent in the interest of the patients. If we are not prepared to carry out the service as we know it should be done, we should not hesitate to call in assistance or refer our patients to another doctor or an institution where we know that they can secure the best. 2. Our Referring Physicians.—We must play the game; get acquainted with them so that we can communicate with them, expressing ourselves freely and knowing that our statements will not be misconstrued as being officious. Give them honest reports after painstaking examinations and treatments. We may not be able to tell everything about a case—few are so gifted—but we should give all the information that we have secured since coming into contact with the patient. We must not be afraid to say we do not know, or that we consider it advisable to secure other medical opinion. 3. Our Competing Confrères.—Speak well of them or say nothing. Show them by example that we are practising our profession on a basis of fairness to all.",

      "title": "Finding a way to be a nurse day after day",
      "abstract": "Defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, grace is \"courteous goodwill\"; mercy is \"compassion or forgiveness shown toward someone whom it is within one's power to punish or harm\"; and peace is \"mental calm, serenity.\" When I speak these three words together, I am describing God's grace, mercy, and peace, which comprise the central force that allows me to live, survive, and thrive in today's world. Chaos surrounds us, violence permeates our homes and streets, and corruption is at every turn. We face countless other challenges as a society and as human beings. Where does one turn for support and purpose? I have often been asked by others about who or what has been most influential in my life, usually in reference to my professional career and not necessarily personal milestones. My unwavering response is instantaneous and consistent—\"God,\" based on my personal belief that He is my leading guide, not discounting other individuals who might be working with and through Him to move me successfully along my life path, which is ever evolving and never quite completed. Nursing is affirmed The American Nurses Association defines nursing as \"the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities; prevention of illness and injury; facilitation of healing; alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response; and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations.\"1 How does a nurse meet this standard day after day? I looked at The American Nurse, a collection of photographs of and interviews with nurses, for some insight. Nurses at all levels and in various positions participated in telling their stories through this book. In the introduction, the author writes that interviews with nurses are \"rich because the people giving them don't have time to dance around words and feelings. They are just so raw.\"2 Several interviews resonated with me because of the nurse's talk of faith or God. Nancy Schreiber works in a night ministry in Chicago, Ill. She says, \"This job gave me the freedom to get into areas like spirituality. As a nurse, we're not encouraged to talk about someone's faith. Here I find the freedom to just be myself and to acknowledge people for who they are, without the need for explanations.\" Judy Harrison in Lexington, Ky., works at a juvenile detention center. She says, \"My grandmother made sure that all nine of her children stayed in church and that her children made sure that we all stayed in church. God was explained to me as a friend who I can talk to and depend on....Would I trade my life some days to be a greeter at Walmart? Sure I would. God and I have discussed that.\" And lastly, Keithen D. Potts multitasks in a public hospital in New Orleans, La. He says, \"I learned a lot about myself during the storm [Hurricane Katrina]. I learned how strong I was as a person. My faith in God is what saw me through. My faith was tested, but I was able to keep standing.... I try not to let things bother me the way they did before the storm. I really learned to take it day by day and appreciate my life and the people around me.\" These testimonies are not unique to these three nurses—I imagine they are shared by many nurses. Nursing is special Interacting with patients with various personalities and multiple healthcare needs is a daily challenge. Remaining grounded at all times is important. Interpersonal interactions and relationships are driven by one's ability to know oneself and be present in the moment, to communicate effectively, and to demonstrate empathy. We pay honor to nurses worldwide every May. This year, think about what makes us what we are—special. Jamesetta A. Newland, PhD, FNP-BC, FAANP, DPNAP, FAAN Editor-in-Chief [email protected]",

The journey from there to the oncology ward is one that can be adequately described as increasingly claustrophobic. It is all one-way traffic from flourishing life to the abyss. Perhaps being a parent makes one even more prone to the universal human tendency to find fault with oneself where there is only the blind force of nature at work. Whatever dark alleyway that self-destructive sentiment emerges from to ambush the optimist, it is certainly an effective hiding place from which to cause them to stumble. The child slips inexorably out of the parent’s grasp. The notion of parental protection is no haven. Yet the blindness of nature unwittingly tips the scales. In the narrowest of narrow places, the human organism responds with homeostatic resilience. Whether death is near or far in this place is unknown. In the moment of constriction, however, the child and its parent respond with that most irreducible of passions, the will to live. The human spirit emerges.",

Non bisogna intendere il collocatore un essere amorfo, che si disinteressa del male altrui e lo compatisce, com piacendosi con se stesso di avere un posto e di non essere tra coloro che sono sfilati in cerca di lavoro di fronte al suo sportello [...] Un'opera che ha le sue vittime, le sue disillusioni; tutto un seguito di materia umana che lavora, che soffre delle altrui sof ferenze.",

Even a dull or destructive relationship hurts when it ends because you still have to let go of your hopes and dreams.\r\nEmotional hurt can be more painful than physical pain and affects our physical as well as mental health. Eating, sleeping and thinking clearly are particularly difficult and when under pressure from studies, particularly worrying.\r\nThe following tips may help you take care of yourself through the break-up, much like you have to take care of yourself when sick. Gradually you do heal and begin to enjoy life again.",

We are instead there to better the lives of non-disabled people. Living with these expectations is exhausting and unsustainable.

They have a favorable impression of their lives and do not suffer excessively from anxiety, alienation, frustration, disappointment, or depression. They may face problems but overall see more positives than negatives. The crucial point is that how one achieves satisfaction differs from person to person. Satisfaction does not necessarily depend on achieving one's goals, but finding satisfaction is not easy. Epicurus and Koheleth agree that the key to satisfaction lies within yourself, because you cannot control the events outside you. Contentment and success may sometimes go together, but, given the choice, would you rather die unhappy with many credits, or happy without much acclaim? Both Epicurus and Koheleth make the case for choosing the latter option.",

The research method used is descriptive qualitative. The research results in Nick Vujicic's autobiography \"Life Without Limits\" show that Nick gets extrinsic motivation from his family, especially his father and mother, who encourage, mobilize, and direct Nick to make ends meet. Motivation from his parents encourages Nick to get the intrinsic motivation within himself to encourage himself to carry out his daily activities (physiological needs), feel secure about his future (need for security and protection), and feel loved and accepted by himself. Friends and family (the need to have and love) with a physical condition without arms and legs. Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation plays an important role that needs and complements each other in facing every difficulty and challenge in life, thus enabling Nick to fulfill his life's needs and get through his dark times&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;",

      "title": "CHOICES: Never-Ending Dilemmas in Everyday Life [PDF, E-Book]",
      "abstract": "This book is about the never-ending need we have to make choices. If you think about it, we have to decide what time to wake up every morning, what to wear (unless we need to wear a uniform), what to have for breakfast (if we eat breakfast), lunch and dinner (and if we eat in restaurants, what to order), and our need to make all kinds of other choices all day long. Some of our choices are mundane, like what to have for breakfast (if we eat breakfast): to have coffee or tea (and if so, plain or with milk), cereal, toast or a bagel (and if so, what kind: plain, with poppy seeds, with everything) or a sweet roll, eggs (if so, fried, soft boiled, scrambled), and so on. Most of the choices we make are not important, and we often develop habits to relieve us of having to think about our choices. For example, I have the same thing for breakfast every day: a bowl of oatmeal with chia seeds and flax seeds, hot milk, a cup of espresso coffee with hot milk, and half a bagel with butter. Occasionally, I have a soft-boiled egg, as well. But other choices we have to make are life-changing, such as how to live (single, living with a partner, or getting married), what kind of education to get, what kind of job or profession to choose, where to live and what kind of house to buy (if you can afford a house), whom to vote for, and so on. After reading this book, you will better understand the role that the choices we make play in society and culture and in our everyday lives.",

This very uncertainty has given their intellectuals a critical function of special interest. The appropriation of some of this self-criticism by foreign ideologues for purposes that go beyond its original scope or intention is an inevitable hazard. But the possibility that a sound enterprise in self-correction may be overheard and misused is the poorest of reasons for suspending it....",

      "abstract": "from Journal of a Writer in Pajamas* Dany Laferrière (bio) Translated by Carrol F. Coates (bio) 68. The Great Writer What a bizarre expression! Thegreatwriter. Does that mean that he is incapable of writing anything bad from now on? He clearly knows that it is impossible to write anything at all without anxiety forming a little lump in the breast. There is no Zen writer. You can pretend to be one. Our man forgets the reason that led him to desire so intensely to express what is gnawing away at him. To speak his ties to the world. People talk a lot about the relationship of the writer to the reader, but it happens that writing may also be a monologue. Writing can be a long-term process. A face-to-face that may last for years without your being forced to don a straitjacket. You do not write simply to impress someone else. Sometimes you do it to tone down the “passion of self” that blinds us. In order to reign in the problem, one sinks more deeply into oneself. But you do not get away from being with yourself. By dint of remaining aware of oneself, one becomes a gentleman or lady. Thegreatwriter or thegreatwomanofletters. What transpires when that happens? Nothing. You are asked to write prefaces for deluxe anthologies or exhibit catalogues. Lectures for a select audience in the salons of fashionable neighborhoods. All that is well-recompensed. That is why your publisher hopes to keep you in his stable. You become a guarantee of quality, which means that you are sometimes read. You are forced on adolescents going for their baccalauréat, who have other axes to grind or who are interested in writers relevant to their own generation. They read you out of the corner of their eyes and quote you when there are guests, which pleases their fathers, but they assiduously avoid you. Contemporary writers are afraid of you, since your writing still holds some sway with certain influential critics and a group of professors of literature who have become booksellers. The next generation is simply waiting for your death so they can breathe more easily. Everybody seems to recognize you. The moment the conversation turns to literature, you are quoted. Your name has finally penetrated the milieux where literature is no better known than nuclear physics. People bow low to you on the street, recognizing your title of great writer. And go on their way. Have they read you? They answer yes and even cite a title or two for you. You know better, since prefaces for the classics bring in more than your own books. And God knows that you’ve written enough of them. People have ceased recounting their lives to you, they are more interested in yours. In journalism, it is said that a reporter who becomes the story must resign. Can a writer resign? Leave his [End Page 33] job? As long as there is one lone reader who remembers you, you are on duty. This is true even if you haven’t written one book worthy of the name in over twenty years. You can do nothing better than to wait for the Nobel, which may never come. But you begin to think about it in spite of yourself, since the instant when that old woman you met in the street said that she thought you deserve the Nobel prize. She has never read you, which lends more credibility to her opinion. This is a sign from on high. In fact, your name has been wafted in the air for some time and people are beginning to breathe it in. People are talking a bit about you all around, even in political circles. This will eventually reach the ears of the Nobel jury. Some individuals are fiercely negative, these are the writers of your own generation. They wear themselves out taking your work apart, piece by piece. The public, which has already made its choice, sees them as envious. But they cease talking. No more opposition, no more rumors about you. Your name slips into anonymity, only to reappear one morning on the first page. A heart...",

      "abstract": "This novel may bewilder, confuse, and perhaps even irritate some readers. Those familiar with Patricia Grace's previous two novels Potiki and Cousins will find Baby No-Eyes a very different and challenging work. On a first reading it is difficult to follow the narrative shifts, although the chapter headings are reliable guides. But, as one narrator reminds us, there are different ways of telling stories: \"There's a way the older people have of telling a story, a way where the beginning is not the beginning, the end is not the end. It starts from a centre and moves away from there in such widening circles that you don't know how you will finally arrive at the point of understanding, which becomes itself another core, a new centre\" (28). On a second reading however, the reader, at least this reader, becomes a member of the whanau, extended family; the characters are familiar, their relationships, problems, secrets, idiosyncrasies, part of everyday life. It is like being welcomed onto a marae; we arrive as manuhiri, visitors, but after the powhiri, official welcome, and hongi, the mingling of breath, strangers become tangatawhenua, people of the land.",

Each stage has a cluster of challenges that demand something more of him that is clean and true. We go through life moderating our own resources, building new dimensions of ourselves on the structures we have just laid down. The everyday problems come in connection with growing. These are always an invitation to develop and come to grips with the difficulties that each new moment presents.

Though sources are the resources informing “the story,” the effort to illuminate decisions and actions casts a shadow inward, prompting questions and concerns, uncertainties and fears about how much can truly be discovered about another we do not know.",

The stranger was one who arrived from afar, who entered market or camp or village, or who was encountered in the forest, the desert or on the high seas. Strangers in these cases are not distant: they are just strange or foreign. They are present, attractive or menacing, rich or needy, welcome or unwelcome, as the case may be. Their claims may be manageable or impossible, repudiatable or acceptable. The expectation is that these claims will be temporary, that strangers will soon distance themselves and claim no further hospitality.",

The piece featured on this month’s cover is from the series Promise of Summer. The monoprints were inspired by the longing for summer after a seemingly never-ending cold, dark winter and relentlessly wet spring. Even though we humans could not go out to the garden and play during this dreary time, the cedar wax wings returned north, the bleeding hearts budded, and a lush green began to spread over the hills. As I made art in my studio waiting for summer, I was struck by the power of nature to regenerate and renew, in spite of harsh conditions. I was again reminded of nature’s tenacious power to bring healing in the environment and in the human body.#530 (Promise of Summer)",

In their works,\nartists have explored the complex and curious nature of love, capturing\nmoments of both agony and ecstasy. As their creations suggest, the intrigue\nof love can captivate the imagination. It is not difficult to see why. An\nunexpected phone call from a romantic partner, a card or note from a family\nmember, or a chance encounter with an old friend each has the potential \nto rouse the spirit and elevate the mood. Although many aspects of affection \nare positive and desirable, affectionate communication can also go awry.\nNewlyweds are often dismayed to find that the endearing idiosyncrasies of\ntheir new spouse quickly become irritating habits that drive a wedge between\nthem. Likewise, college students inevitably find that the devotion of their\nparents can easily become an overbearing and possibly constraining\ninterference in their social or personal lives. Although many of the outcomes\nof affection are good, affection can be risky for both senders and receivers,and sometimes expressions of affection lead to confusing and complicated\nturns of events. As Hunt’s quote suggests, affection enables us to become\ncloser to people we care about, but this closeness often has a way of\nmagnifying the tiny monsters that lurk within us all.",

Whether such actions evoke feelings of admiration or condemnation often depends on the eye of the beholder and whether one is the giver or the receiver. The subjects of the chapters – including human rights activists, asylum case officers, gender specialists, protection officers, UN officials, relief workers, peacebuilders, and legal experts – all present themselves as motivated by a sense of compassion and duty. Enacting an ethic of care and responsibility, they were attempting to correct perceived injustices, defend vulnerable populations from harm, and provide new opportunities and choices to marginalized and oppressed peoples. As Swaine observes of aid workers, but probably is true of many others mentioned in this volume, they were acting on an “imperative,” the heartfelt belief that something had to be done. However, as she and others acknowledge, this imperative can lead them to act first and ask questions later, if ever. Sometimes they apologize for their neglect. At other times, though, they offer reasons why their unilateral actions were unavoidable, understandable, and perhaps even in the best interests of the population in need.",

For the stakeholders in a situation, be it a crisis or not, acknowledging the necessity of a dialogue between them implies each of them acknowledging and accepting that they alone are unable to propose a feasible way out of this situation; starting up dialogue implies the acknowledgement and acceptance of one's incompleteness. The illusion helps to contain anxiety until the individual can confront the realty of reality, or better, the reality of the real.

      "abstract": "Despite increased interest and research into personal accounts of depression, it has seldom been studied specifically from the point of view everyday life. Our aim is to highlight how depression progresses in relation to everyday activities, and to interpret the process using a theory of everyday life. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 55 persons (31 women, 24 men) in their 40s who self-identified as having been depressed. Depression typically progressed as follows: It originated in a difficult life situation, which was coped with by trying to manage or by escaping to drinking. Eventually, it was not possible to carry out everyday duties. Seeking treatment and sick leave signified a disconnection from everyday obligations. Leisure activities as well as support from close people helped in coping, and gradually a new, more meaningful and enjoyable everyday life developed. Disconnection, rest, reflection, reorientation, and reorganization of life seemed to build a pathway out of depression. Thus, a depressive episode could be interpreted as a process in which the person first disengaged from the unreflected everyday and then reflectively re-engaged to it.",

Well, I think in a sense it may be; but in another, clearly is not. Among those who have felt this strangeness is Ramchandra Gandhi who, in an excellent recent work, The Availability of Religious Ideas (Macmillan, 1976), maintained – There is no difficulty in seeing that I cannot intelligibly conceive of my own death – the ceasing to be, for good, of myself, my consciousness. I can conceive of temporary lapses into unconsciousness, always overcome by a return to consciousness. The difficulty is this: in asking myself the question 'What will it be like to be irreversibly unconscious?' (and the state of affairs here sought to be visualized would exclude all dream activity and dream-thinking of all types), I want both to remain self-conscious and visualize actual loss of capacity for self-consciousness. This cannot be done (p. 39; italics mine).",

      "abstract": "Too often, people drift through life with a vague sense of uneasiness, living in the antechamber, longing to find some adventure or purpose in life, envious of those whose lives seem exciting. In Write It Down, Make It Happen, Henriette Anne Klauser, Ph.D., shows you how to write your own lifescript. Simply your goals in life is the first step toward achieving them. The writing it down part is not about time management; it's not a to-do today list that will you feel guilty if you don't get every single thing done. Rather, it is about clearing your head, identifying what you want, and setting your intent. You can make it happen purely by believing in the possibility. There is no right way to write a goal -- a single line jotted on a scrap of paper is as valuable as a full-blown description of the goal that goes on for several pages. Once you state your goals in writing, the rest of the world can cooperate with your ambition -- from grand career goals and major moves to having a better relationship with a teenage son, or simply waking up in the morning happy. In Write It Down, Make It Happen, you will read stories from ordinary people who witnessed miracles large and small unfold in their lives after they performed the basic act of putting their goals on paper. Dr. Klauser also includes practical exercises and tips on how you can use to understand what you want and become a proactive force in your own destiny.",

      "title": "Authoring your life : developing an internal voice to navigate life's challenges",
      "abstract": "Who am I? What do I want in relationships? How do I know what to believe? How do I manage the stresses of living? This is a guide to addressing life's challenges and competing demands. It will help you to reflect on the problems and setbacks you encounter to discover your own voice, uncover your authentic sense of values, build your confidence, and find meaning in your life. This is, however, far more than a self-help book; and it addresses multiple audiences. Because everyone's circumstances differ, and life is unpredictable, this book does not offer simplistic solutions and steps to follow. Instead, Marcia Baxter Magolda immerses you in the stories of thirty-five adults whom she has followed and interviewed for over twenty years. With her guidance, and using the self-authorship framework she has developed, you will recognize in yourself many patterns and parallels from the protagonists' stories of emotional and intellectual growth. By reflecting on these life stories, you will gain insights about your individual values and identity, and strengthen your sense of self-reliance to handle significant transitions and unexpected circumstances. In addition to helping you identify the phases of your journey to self-authorship, Marcia Baxter Magolda offers reflective exercises and questions to help you uncover your strengths and identify the barriers that may be inhibiting you from building the internal, psychological compass that will serve as the foundation for your journey. Offering advice on how to be good company for those who have set out on their journey to self-authorship, the book is also addressed to partners, family members, friends, teachers, mentors, and employers, so they can offer support to those that face these challenges. Finally, for scholars of adult development, this book offers the latest articulation of the developing theory of self-authorship.",

      "title": "Conscience in ContextA study of the nature of consciencerelating to its historical developmentand existential environment",
      "abstract": "The topic of conscience has fascinated me for a number of years. In the course of my\r\npastoral work in different parishes, and chaplaincy work with young people and those\r\nin hospital, whether for mental or physical reasons, I have encountered countless\r\npeople who struggled with moral dilemmas or who felt crushed by guilt owing to the\r\ngap between their practice and their knowledge of what they were called to do. I have\r\nalso met individuals who seemed to be unaware that, despite the gravity of the action,\r\nwhat they were doing was in any way wrong. Whether mentioned or left implicit, the\r\nconscience of each of these individuals played a vital role in the decision to choose\r\none course of action over another, in judging a completed action to have been right or\r\nwrong, or even in exhibiting a state of perplexed uncertainty as to what should be\r\ndone next. Thinking over these different problems led me to reflect further on the\r\nquestion of erroneous conscience. Could an action that was considered to be wrong by\r\nothers (particularly by the Magisterium of the Church) be good, virtuous or\r\nmeritorious if the individual believed it to be so? Do we live in parallel moral\r\nuniverses, where the person ultimately defines what is moral solely by belief or\r\nconviction, or do we have access to a ground of universal truth, rooted in our created\r\nnature, as gifted by God? Therefore, should the pastor leave the individual in blissful\r\nignorance, or should he try to deepen moral understanding or help develop the moral\r\ncapacities of the people he encounters?\r\nConsideration of questions such as these led me to investigate the possibility\r\nof making conscience the subject of doctoral research. However, the resultant thesis is\r\nnot a study of pastoral problems, in the style of a manualistic analysis of cases of\r\nconscience. Rather the study is at the level of fundamental moral theology, presented\r\nin the hope that a deepened awareness of the nature and function of conscience will\r\nshape my future pastoral activity, and in the hope that it might help others, too, in\r\ntheir understanding of this core notion of morality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We are creatures of habit. Most people’s day is organized around the eating of three meals, with each meal pretty much scheduled to the same time of day. We also tend to retire and arise on the same schedule. On top of these basic biological dictates is the imposition of earning a living, an endeavor usually accomplished from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. There are several niggling reinforcements associated with this schedule. Steady employment is difficult if one habitually comes late to work or leaves early; and long lunches are out unless you happen to be eating with the boss. I guess it is safe to say that individuals and society have forced themselves and itself into a rut ... but this is not necessarily bad. Following a routine makes life a bit easier and much more efficient: It is not necessary to make decisions over the timing of fundamental events like eating and sleeping, and much more can be accomplished when we work in focused groups. And notice how a routine benefits older people, especially those whose minds are not functioning as well as they used to; they stick pretty much to rote behavior and thus glide through each day with only a minimal need for decision making and leadership. Of course, the rigidity can be overdone: Try and find a restaurant that will serve you a bowl of breakfast cereal at 7 P.M.",

      "abstract": "LAST year continuity and discontinuity were much on my mind. As has been a habit of mine, I transposed the personal problem with its inevitable ambiguities onto the bright-lit stage of an impersonal question. Why make another move? Why cut the roots that one has established, perhaps for the first time in one's life? One answer is that I have always felt that being in place-being rooted-is an illusion. I have always been haunted by the idea of departure both of the glad, self-initiated and of the wrenching, unwilling kind. We are all more or less aware of a final departure that awaits us, but we are less aware of it when we are in the presence of friends and good books and are comforted by their projection of continuity and of reverberating meaning. When we glance at newspaper headlines or look about us beyond the privileged islands of stability, we may well be overcome by a sense of happenstance and finitude. I will return to the topic of happenstance and finitude near the end of this essay, for the main thrust here is to explore in a general way questions of continuity and discontinuity, linkage and disjunction as instances of how we think and, subsidiarily, as aspects of reality. I provide an academic setting for the personal question with which I opened this essay and with which I shall end it.",

      "abstract": "The psychological state and mental health of students is extremely important during military operations. Many experiences exhaustion, devastation, fatigue, anxiety and panic. There are several methods to control yourself in critical conditions, how to help loved ones and maintain a healthy mental state in critical conditions. In military situations, our body works at maximum capacity. Stress hormones, whose task is to mobilize the body in a critical situation, also have their “expiration date”. There may be strong mood swings from anxiety, anger, a surge of optimism to complete devastation and exhaustion. It is important to realize that these are absolutely natural states that replace each other over time. Each of them can and should be worked on. Panic is an attack of severe fear, anxiety and internal tension. Panic paralyzes a person or, on the contrary, pushes him to reckless actions. During panic, opposite reactions are observed: some want to run, others, on the contrary, want to hide in a corner. It is important to remember that this is the state in which the enemy wants to see us, because in it we are most vulnerable, so it is imperative to take measures to restore a normal mental state. Acute attacks of panic and anxiety are usually followed by a feeling of apathy. Such periods may not be long, but they also need to be worked through. It is important to remember that apathy is a natural “chemical” rollback after a surge of stress hormones. In a critical situation, it is necessary to remain calm. Try to maintain relationships and help your loved ones and those who are nearby, because this increases your ability to survive and resist, and gives meaning to your actions.",

Of course this does not guarantee that the next century will turn out well.

      "abstract": "Abstract Can home mean different things to different people? The answer is yes. For some, it is the house where they grew up, a place filled with memories and familiar surroundings. For others, it might be a local café or restaurant where the sights, sounds, tastes and smells create a sense of comfort and routine as natural as the sun’s rising and setting. Home is not always a physical space; it can be a feeling of belonging and connection tied to the people around us. It might be found in a supportive community, shared laughter with friends over tea or coffee or deep conversations with loved ones. Home also exists in the intangible, like the vacations that bring joy and the cherished memories that linger long after the trip ends. It is not bound by one location or definition – it is anywhere or anything that becomes a part of who you are, shaping your identity and grounding your sense of self. The meaning of home, however, is not universal. For some, it is a place of safety and belonging. For others, especially those experiencing homelessness or displacement, it is a longing for stability, connection and acceptance. Regardless of circumstance, the need for belonging and a sense of ‘home’ is a fundamental human experience. This chapter will wrap up by explaining how the goals of this book have been met, the main contributions to knowledge and suggestions for future studies.",

Most people view their daydreams as very private affairs that they feel less comfortable describing to other people than when they are describing their real experiences (Klinger, Murphy, Ostrem, & Stark-Wroblewski, 2004–2005).

We relate this to a gradual erosion of their emotional, psychological and physical faculties and how this has been facilitated by the meagre forms of support given to them along the way. Personal markers of the self are instead measured against the physical and visual degeneration of other people around them and regulated by the ideological figure of the “machaca”. Because many, we suggest, have spent many years in denial of their situations, when prompted to face up to this, almost all struggle. We point out here that all this collectively interferes with the commitment required of them by the treatment system, which in itself, is snared with further barriers and challenges such as long waiting lists, poor housing placements and substandard work options. The majority then simply return to drugs and to Valdemingómez passing time before their inevitable death. This process we call the “personal surrender”.",

      "abstract": "?Cuando vamos a aprender? Apenas nos recuperabamos de Enron y WorldCom cuando tuvimos que enfrentar el colapso de las hipotecas subprime y mas escandalos que remecieron nuestra confianza en los negocios. Esto nos plantea la pregunta: ?confiamos demasiado? \n\nEn este articulo, el autor explora las razones de por que confiamos con tanta facilidad, y con tan poca prudencia. El explica que la genetica y el aprendizaje en la infancia nos predisponen a confiar, lo que ha sido un buen mecanismo de supervivencia. Dicho esto, nuestra disposicion a confiar nos vuelve vulnerables.\n\nNuestro sentido de la confianza reacciona a senales muy simples, como cuando la persona se parece a nosotros o pertenece a nuestro grupo social. Tambien confiamos en terceros que verifiquen la confiabilidad de otros, a veces en detrimento nuestro (como ocurrio con las victimas de Bernard Madoff). Agregue nuestras ilusiones de invulnerabilidad, y las tendencias a ver lo que queremos ver y sobreestimar nuestro juicio, y el resultado es que podemos ser enganados facilmente.\nDebemos desarrollar una confianza moderada. Para los que confian demasiado, significa leer mejor las senales; para los desconfiados, implica tener conductas mas receptivas. Todos deberian empezar con acciones pequenas que alienten la reciprocidad y mas confianza. Tambien ayuda el protegerse contra los abusos, como los guionistas de Hollywood que registran sus tratamientos de guion en el Sindicato de Guionistas de EE.UU.\n\nPara atraer a las relaciones correctas, las personas deben enviar senales fuertes de su honestidad, disipar las preocupaciones de la contraparte y tomar represalias si hay abuso. Confiar en los individuos por el rol que tienen �es decir, confiar en el sistema que los selecciona y capacita� tambien ayuda, pero no es infalible. Y no basta la due diligence para protegerse; se necesita una vigilancia constante para asegurarse de que el entorno no ha cambiado.",

The children of disorganization cannot create classroom organization; and the teacher can only work with those who have somehow managed to acquire enough of the necessary motivation. Hope is not a simple nutrient. It goes straight to the heart of organization and makes it work. Achievement depends on hope—and hope rests on time. Though the poor have little hope for life, they do not wish to die.",

We hope that, when necessary, either through a master plan beyond our comprehension or through just plain luck, we will run into good Samaritans, friends, and experienced colleagues who will be willing to help us. We all need wise and trusted counselors—which, by the way, is the definition of mentor . But where does the wisdom come from? And is trust an automatic attribute of those who declare themselves to be mentors? Are you wise because you have a job with authority? Are you worthy of trust because of personal assurances?\n\nEven in the neighborhood where I grew up, even on the streets of Brooklyn, trust was something earned over time. People were thought to be wise because of what they said and did, not because of what they preached.\n\nOnce, we expected each generation to prepare the next out of a sense of responsibility and an appreciation for the continuity of life.

      "title": "Climate change: Clinical considerations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological reactions to climate change run the gamut from a sense of the need for urgent action to utter denial. This paper looks at some categories of defenses that block acknowledgement of this pressing threat. It cites the work of Renee Lertzman, an analytically oriented social scientist, whose research suggested that disavowal, negation, or denial could be deconstructed and viewed as defenses against intolerable anxieties, feelings of helplessness and disappointment, loss and guilt, and warded‐off wishes for agency and reparation. Clinical examples and personal self‐reflection are employed to posit that when anxiety over climate change, a serious disquiet in its own right, gets confused with childhood traumatic anxiety, with its attendant feelings of helplessness, smallness, hopelessness, shame, isolation, and useless rage, then dysfunctional defenses and affects are more likely to come to the fore. In contrast to this, realistic anxiety over our changing climate and need to shift from a carbon‐based culture can be made more tolerable and can allow one to face the uncertain future, to feel one's feelings, to work them through, to share them without shame, and to feel a certain amount of agency in confronting the climate future and working to cope with it, both individually and societally. Finally, the paper suggests that we clinicians need to listen with new awareness to patients' references to and defenses against climate change, as not simply displacements but also as allusions to a looming reality that is a thing in itself. It is suggested that although we cannot impose our agendas on our patients, as climate change disavowal breaks down, we do have in our tool kit ways of helping our patients with it, depending of course very much on the state of our own disavowal.",

      "abstract": "abstract Caprice is a talent of human nature, besides, life experiences and recognitions are crucial for vision accrued. If follow the cues of imagination, would finally find out similar pictures just exist somewhere in this world. Composing with reality and fantasy, my art work, or the creation, mainly describes the cherish memories, questions of unusual phenomenon in reality, and my best wishes for future expectations. The reverie of my childhood was so impressed and vivid in mind. Sometimes, I feel like a child who never grown up, and cannot help myself to stop chasing the fantastic world in dreams. Perhaps it is because of the unsure feeling toward unknown future, at the same time, I look back those days I have been through, memorize the old times. Then visions appeared in front of me, and they became essential elements of my art work. These visions are not completely made up without any causes or reasons, but they are reflections and introspection of life experiences, they are attitudes toward the society. By using figurative vision form to compose the whole picture, try to introduce the surrealistic truth in mind. The settled time and space, the representation of real things enrich the description of picture. Try to figure out the real meanings behind reality and fantasy, and then to explain the irrational ironies come to mind. Connecting with time and space, where seems like a quiet place but also with floating time. A realistic vision is obviously tending to touch people’s mind. Time and space, mysterious components and arrangements create the possible conversation between viewers and the creation. In Chapter One explains the motive and aims of the creation, and gives definitions of certain important words. In Chapter Two are divided in to two parts: the concept of self-creation and document discussion. The concept of self-creation explains the basic ideas come from the reality. Outside life experiences and inner reflections made the soul of creation, and her body is an aogical image. In the section of document discussion explains the relating schools of thought, includes Symbolism, Surrealism and Magic Realism. Chapter Three is about the background information of origin concept and practical process. Chapter Four is description of contents, forms, skills and materials. In first section of Chapter Four is about the selection of content. Examining today’s phenomenon, and then drew out the future blueprint with great expectations. In Section Two is the form of content, uses nature elements as subject, and expands discussion in various topics. In Section Three is about the skills and materials, explains the requiring skills and needed instruments or materials in the art work. Chapter Five is composition and analysis of the creation, mainly explains where the ideas come from and detail explanations. Chapter Six is conclusion, shows out several questions, then find out my way of self-creation in future. I expect my attitude toward creation should focus on several parts: epoch, specific content, proper form and various subjects. Finally, I would like to deliver my best wishes to this land sincerely.",

The challenge is to understand for yourself, without anyone's influence, what fulfills them, what they are good at, in order to make the best use of their time and recognize what they would do. Students should always start from the analysis of their internal capacities, because only they can be realistic and stable indicators, which do not depend on external influences.

      "abstract": "There is a time in the development of new orthoses and prostheses, when it can suddenly all come together—when researchers surpass what they hope might be, and achieve what they dream about. I was reminded of this today when a patient, colleague, and friend looked at me profoundly and said, “This is the best my prosthesis has ever felt to me.” It was the ultimate reward in our latest work.Thinking about how one gets to that point of success, I think back on a very long timeline. Edison spoke of inspiration and considerably more perspiration being required for invention. In almost every case, there are years and years of separate, unconnected thoughts that slowly coalesce into new ideas. We ponder what could be and more importantly, what should be. Collegial contacts prompt us and challenge our assumptions. And then, if we have the doggedness to see it through, there are hundreds of ways we test those ideas until failure and observation form solid concepts to build on. Yet, finishing is still far from certain. Usually it is the help of many colleagues that will make possible the actual creation of something wonderful. For prosthetists and orthotists, I think the driving force to see us through is helping our patients achieve that experience of feeling better now than anytime since before their physical challenges. We measure success not by the object we make or how much it costs but rather by the simple human experience of how it helps someone feel better than they thought they could. As a profession, we are incredibly fortunate when we get to share that. Thinking about it now makes me smile. I was just that fortunate today. David A.

It is a crucible within which we are tested, since it seems to ask more than we have to give, particularly when our own development and self-protection has required of us a disavowal of the self we most deeply are. As the fertile in-between space of our psychotherapy deepens, my patient and I wrestle, in parallel, with the challenges of coming into being and the challenges of motherhood. And then, she faces a trial greater than any she has faced before. Her new growth is shaken like a blossom in a violent storm and my sense of my capacity as a therapist is shaken too.

Through long and intimate acquaintance he learned the social and economic stresses of his flock, the hidden errors and the familial blights to be encountered. He encouraged the promising and helped cushion the realities and failures of the less successful. His position as sociologist and practical psychologist has not been filled in the community, for the industrial revolution and the present industrial revolt have changed the atmosphere of the growing community from one of neighborly sharing in the intimate pleasures and problems to one in which sociologic interest is too largely official and too often accompanied with political aspirations.

Was there anything to show for all those hours, months, years of effort and meetings and projects and worry? Did any of it make a difference? Had I stayed too long? While staying twenty years had never been part of any plan, somehow it had happened, and it has been rewarding and professionally challenging all the same. A satisfying professional career is as much about the linkages and connections we make along the way as it is about the increase in responsibility or authority or prestige of one's position.

      "title": "Otro modo de pensar",
      "abstract": "«Sin embargo, son pocos los que gastan diariamente algo de su tiempo en la aventura de dialogar con amigos callados que nos cuentan una historia, nos exponen sus pensamientos o ayudan a encaminar nuestra vida por una senda prometedora» (p. 222). En este párrafo del último capítulo del libro de Alejandro Llano podríamos descubrir la intención con la que el autor ha escrito este «Otro modo de pensar». Ha querido compartir sus pensamientos con amigos callados, quizás para darles voz con los argumentos que él les presta. Quizás para sacarles de «lo políticamente correcto» y hacerles «pensar: no hay faena más difícil y evasiva. Todo conspira para que no la llevemos a cabo» (p. 9). Quizás porque está inquieto y este momento le resulta «grave» y quiere buscar compañeros de este Otro modo que pensar. Lo que es cierto es que, cuando lees el libro, cada capítulo, es como una tertulia de café con el profesor Llano y con Alejandro, si me permite el autor que le tutee. Se atisba al profesor, al maestro, pero también se atisba aquella cercanía del que quiere compartir lo que piensa sobre temas que considera o muy importantes o muy oportunos. Por eso navega sobre temas de tal calado como la educación, la familia, la ética, la política, la justicia social, la economía más humana, la ciudadanía, el humanismo, la universidad y la trascendencia. Digo navega porque, como podrán comprender, no puede entrar en cuestiones de tal densidad con demasiada profundidad en 224 páginas y eso queda reflejado en que a veces se pueden observar saltos en la argumentación que un especialista de cada área o un lector avezado podría cuestionar. Algunos ejemplos de ello los encontramos en el capítulo de educación cuando identifica actividad con agitación (pp. 21 y 22) o en el de familia cuando hila pobreza social y divorcio (p. 42) o expresiones efusivas de afecto como enemigas de la fortaleza (p. 49). Lo que sí es cierto es que uno se da cuenta de que la intención del autor no es la de la argumentación rigurosa de un tema, aunque evidentemente se da en su mayoría, sino precisamente mostrarnos y compartir con nosotros su modo de pensar, ofrecer otra forma de ver, interpretar y actuar en este mundo. Uno puede estar o no de acuerdo pero se pega a esa mesa de café y, cogiendo su taza con las dos manos, como en una tarde tranquila de otoño o invierno, decide seguir escuchando lo que piensa un maestro avezado, profesor e investigador de filosofía, con infinitas publicaciones y con una mirada sobre la vida con mucho recorrido y perspectiva. Esto es precisamente lo más interesante del libro. Es un libro de madurez, donde ya parece que al autor no le interesan ni los tratados especializados ni las acreditaciones académicas; le interesa trasmitir, con nitidez, claridad y una sencillez que se agradece, lo que piensa sobre los temas que más le preocupan de la sociedad actual. No tiene citas eruditas sino que a veces menciona a un autor como tratando de mostrarnos que en algún aspecto es una referencia. En el fondo se atisba una paternidad agradecida con la vida y que hay que agradecer, un legado, ese tratar de «ayudar a encaminar nuestra vida por una senda prometedora» (p. 222). Llano en primer lugar nos increpa, nos urge a pensar por nosotros mismos y nos previene de lo políticamente correcto, única forma de liberarnos de la sumisión. Para ello comienza y termina el libro alentando al diálogo como forma indispensable de pensamiento y especialmente el diálogo respetuoso que se da en la lectura, haciendo un elogio del leer en el vivir. Por tanto, critica los idealismos y el robinsonismo. En el capítulo sobre la educación pone el dedo en la llaga tocando aquellos temas más de actualidad, siendo consciente de las tensiones actuales que se viven en ella. Pone el horizonte en el lugar adecuado la maduración, la vitalidad, la fecundidad, la formación, el aprendizaje y el esfuerzo— y critica el activismo sin norte, la apropiación de la educación por parte de las ideologías, el excesivo control burocrático y la búsqueda de una eficacia impropia del ámbito educativo, donde lo pausado y lo fecundo son vitales. También ofrece un ataque claro al pragmatismo y a la tendencia de poner la educación al servicio del empleo y no de la formación de una personalidad madura. En el capítulo sobre la familia Llano señala cómo esta «constituye el más fundamental grupo generador de sentido» (p. 40) y, quizás en un mundo carente de este, es de especial relevancia cultivar y cuidar los vínculos familiares. A su vez, entiende que es el lugar de la «solidaridad primaria, la más radical y básica» (p. 40). La clave de este capítulo la encontramos en la siguiente afirmación: «La gran paradoja consiste en que el Estado de Bienestar ha ignorado la radical fuente humana de auténtico bienestar: la familia…» (p. 42). En cuanto a «La razón práctica y la práctica ética», el autor constata que «sucede que estos tres conceptos —bienes, virtudes y reglas— ya no pueden ser cabalmente comprendidos desde la mentalidad actualmente dominante […] no admitimos que haya algo así como bienes morales comunes, sino que tendemos a pensar que el bien moral es cosa de cada uno […] hemos perdido el significado genuino de lo que pueda ser la virtud […] no aceptamos que se nos impongan reglas morales» (p. 61). Ante todo esto, aparte de tratar de cuestionar las bases de estas afirmaciones modernas, vuelve a constatar la importancia de la familia para superar este «tiempo nublado» (p. 68). El capítulo que más referencias actuales aporta es el de «Indignación y política ». En él da su opinión sobre si los «Indignados» son realmente un fenómeno nuevo o no y vuelve al punto clave de la educación y su necesidad de no centrarse en el conocimiento puramente instrumental. De alguna manera nos sitúa en uno de los puntos centrales de la propuesta de este libro: la importancia de las humanidades y la familia para una sociedad más solidaria y justa. Posteriormente aborda el tema de la «Riqueza y la desigualdad» y continúa con «La actualidad del mundo clásico» y la importancia del «Liderazgo y el humanismo en la nueva economía». De estos tres capítulos conviene destacar el de la actualidad del mundo clásico. En él se ve claramente al profesor de filosofía que hace una lectura histórica preciosa de cómo hemos llegado a nuestro pensamiento actual, de cuáles son sus riesgos y posibilidades. En este capítulo su nivel de erudición y profundización marca distancia respecto a otros capítulos. Continúa situándonos en la disyuntiva entre «Ciudadanos o convidados de piedra». Es claramente la derivación necesaria de los tres anteriores capítulos: «Entendía Husserl que la desorientación de los europeos provenía de un modo de pensar que —por renunciar al conocimiento de verdad— se vuelve incapaz de hacerse cargo de cuestiones decisivas de la existencia» (p. 129). Con ello hace una crítica al triunfo del mecanicismo y el individualismo. En un interesantísimo capítulo, nos llama a decidir entre la verdadera ciudadanía que se une vitalmente tejiendo el bien común o el espectador «acallado» por el Estado del bienestar. Con los capítulos de «Administración pública y humanismo», «La realidad de la ficción» y el «Humanismo civil: oportunidades y riesgos», Llano intenta arrojar luz sobre cómo tendría que ser la organización de un Estado capaz de caminar hacia el bien común con una ciudadanía activa. En definitiva, nos clarifica la relación entre lo privado y lo público en su «modo de pensar» humanista. También destaca la importancia de la literatura en la comprensión de lo permanente y esencial de la condición humana y lo necesario de los clásicos por el acierto y profundidad en esa comprensión. Finalmente, apuesta por el humanismo cívico, como el que propone sustituir este «modelo descendente de colonización de los mundos vitales por un paradigma ascendente de emergencia de energías cívicas desde la familia, y a través de las comunidades solidarias, en el marco de una cultura de responsabilidad ciudadana» (p. 176). Termina el libro con los capítulos sobre la relación que él entiende que existe entre «La crisis actual y la trascendencia», abogando por la lógica del don, su propuesta para la universidad señalando como punto clave su relación con la Verdad y la invitación a la que aludíamos desde el principio a «Leer y vivir». En definitiva, como dice el autor, «el libro tiene todas las ventajas: su uso es totalmente libre, no pretende apabullar a nadie, invita sin obligar, puede ser sustituido sin celos y, además, es barato» (p. 223). Y, ciertamente, el texto de Llano tiene todas las ventajas: es sencillo y claro, no pretende convencer a nadie, expone su modo de pensar tocando los temas, como decíamos, importantes y oportunos. Se nos regala como un libro de madurez de un maestro, mostrándonos cómo concibe el mundo, qué piensa sobre él y cómo podemos responder a sus vacíos y debilidades de modo activo y consciente. Si tuviera algo que objetar son las veces que me he encontrado a Heidegger en sus hojas como fuente de iluminación; aunque ciertamente reconoce su protagonismo en unas de las páginas más tristes y repulsivas de la historia de la universidad (p. 204), creo que las cosas por las que acude a él las puede encontrar sin menoscabo en otros autores. Y la otra objeción es una cierta tendencia a sustantivar este «otro modo de pensar» (p. 16). Creo que podría correr el riesgo de cerrar el pensamiento, o que «otros», «algunos», lo tomen como el «otro modo políticamente correcto de pensar» y corra el riesgo de no animar a que todos pensemos en profundidad, con rigor, vitalidad y diálogo, que creo que es la verdadera pretensión del libro. El libro es, como les decía, unas tardes de café con el profesor y el ser humano, con un D. Alejandro Llano algo paternal en el sentido más positivo de la palabra. Podemos estar de acuerdo o no, pero nos hace pensar sobre temas fundamentales y el entrelazamiento entre todos ellos: única forma del pensar riguroso, la coherencia en la articulación de los temas. No esperemos un libro de erudición, aunque hay capítulos en que se ve la maestría en el manejo de los autores y su pensamiento.

      "abstract": "The Unadjusted Fieldworker For a researcher, fieldwork is usually not only a confrontation with another world, but also with one’s own ‘unadjusted’ behavior in this world. Fieldworkers often focus their research on the way in which everyday life takes shape and meaning in societies, or are interested in everyday matters from a different angle. The lack of experiential knowledge and, sometimes, adaptability means that they do not always observe all requested or required standards of behavior in everyday situations. The unadjusted behavior that results from this can lead to hilarity or discomfort, and have all kinds of other consequences. At the same time, it can have an important function by revealing something of the world that lies behind the daily routines and habits of respondents. This essay elaborates on this issue on the basis of a fieldwork experience in a crime-stricken neighborhood of Guatemala City.",

      "title": "@, or, Being on Line: A Reply to Timothy Luke, \"Digital Beings &amp; Virtual Times\"",
      "abstract": "@, or, Being on Line A Reply to Timothy Luke, “Digital Beings & Virtual Times” Samira Kawash (bio) “So there I was on line, when this kid started pushing me from behind, practically knocked me down...” For a moment after overhearing this fragment of conversation, I was extremely disoriented, for if the speaker had been doing what I thought she had been doing, how could someone have pushed her or knocked her down? Then it hit me: not “on line,” as in using the computer, but “on line” as in waiting in line. My confusion seems understandable, living as I do surrounded by exhortations, pleas, bribes and demands: to go on line, to bank on line, to chat and date on line, to shop on line, to work and play on line. As idiomatic expressions take on new meanings, some confusion seems inevitable. But the particular form of my confusion, the nature of mis-recognition that created a moment of incredulity, points to something more complex than simple shifts in language use. For the problem as I sought to make sense of the conversation I had overheard amounted to this: what sort of condition is it when one is on line? Is it condition that allows for such events as being pushed? My inability to reconcile being pushed with being on line suggests that at least initially my automatic assumption was that no, being on line, on the computer that is, is a non-physical activity that is incommensurable with such roughness. But as my confusion suggests, “on line” is a peculiar state, somewhere between a physical encounter and the evanescent ether of the electrical signal. And if this is the case, then what sort of place is on line, and what sort of entities—subjects or persons—might one find there? The possibility of such questions now, at this particular technological and historical juncture, seems both symptom and effect of the radical uncertainty and anticipation of our time. I am certainly not the first to be struck by these questions in their disorienting newness. It has become axiomatic in certain circles that new digital technologies are transformative and that we are collectively on the cusp of a new era defined by the digital in which all our old assumptions, all our old ways of thinking and doing, are about to be radically transformed. The question then seems to be, are we ready for the future? Timothy Luke, in the inaugural issue of Theory & Event 1.1 , calls for a new political analysis, one capable of taking into account the new “digital beings” surrounding and pervading our lives.1 Luke suggests that the digital revolution is creating new forms of subjectivity and new forms of being and therefore demands a reconsideration of ethics, politics, and community. Luke thus brings a welcome sense of political urgency to a debate about the cyber-future that continues to be overwhelmingly dominated by the WIRED magazine school of smug libertarianism, personified in Luke’s essay by the WIRED editor and guru Nicholas Negroponte. Luke seeks to take on the “big questions” raised by the impending digital era. Where Negroponte shamelessly and simplistically “tout[s] the exciting new world of ‘being digital’ as it is being invented in his digitizing workshops [at MIT’s Media Lab],”2 Luke’s aim is to “speculatively reconsider some vital questions about personal agency and social structure in the cyberspaces generated by telematic systems.”3 Thus, while Luke is sharply critical of Negroponte’s “glibness,” he shares with Negroponte a vision of this “exciting new world,” a digitally revolutionized world that is rapidly taking on a life of its own independent of the intentions and designs of its inventors. It is difficult to resist being swept up in the millennial spirit shared by Luke and Negroponte, a sense of something absolutely new on the horizon. But I remain skeptical of the celebration of newness; for while I too am seduced by the geometrically expanding possibilities unfolding before me each time I boot up, I am also struck by the tenacious persistence of the kind of “old-fashioned” thinking that the so-called digital revolution claims to abolish. I am intrigued by...",

      "title": "Helping Clients to Create the Third Stage of Life",
      "abstract": "Introduction are you doing for rest of your is first line of a love song that is considered an old standard. The song raises interesting questions for baby boomer clients who are considering third stage of life. First, what are they going to do in it? second, imagine for a moment that they (rather than another) are person they love-in a caring, self-accepting and non-egotistical way, of course. Given that they will be only person guaranteed to be there for rest of their lives, how do they want to spend rest of their lives with themselves? What is best way for them to cherish, care for, and respect themselves at this juncture? What ways of being and activities will create most meaningful relationship with themselves and others? Arriving at the answers to these questions is a creative journey-career counselors and other professionals can serve as helpful travel guides along way. A first question for boomers and professionals who work with this group to consider is, What are developmental tasks at this time of life? According to Jung (1933), We cannot live afternoon of life according to programme of life's morning-for what was great in morning will be little at evening, and what in morning was true will at evening have become a lie. (p. 108). Just what does adult development look like in later years? What are developmental tasks at this point? What is it that we still have left to do? Adult Developmental Theory Until relatively recently, human developmental theory and research focused on childhood because it was perceived as greatest period of growth. It was almost as if once we ended our physical growth, when our parents could no longer chart our height by drawing lines on door, that we stopped other kinds of growth as well. In recent years, however, more attention has been given to adult development. A review of 13 adult developmental theorists (Robertson, 2005) found a number of themes in common. All theories 1) described adult development as an on-going process; 2) included a systems component to explain impact of culture on individuals and process whereby individuals attempt to incorporate information from their environments; 3) described a change, growth, or learning process to explain how individuals master or incorporate certain information and ways of being; 4) presented an onward and upward progression of development, where lower levels are seen as less evolved or mature than higher levels; 5) presented an ongoing process of incorporating what fits from present or previous phases of knowing and a letting go of ideas that no longer apply; and 6) suggested last period of adult development requires a summing up of life so that one can move on to a period which includes generativity and transcendence. Adult development is all about process. The challenge is to continue to grow, learn, and develop with an awareness of who we are, what has influenced our beliefs, and how we are impacted by others. Our task at this stage is to continue to decide what we want for our lives by affirming what fits and letting go of what no longer seems right for us. The last period of adult development requires that we integrate our life experiences to achieve a coherent sense of self. The ideal is to mature and evolve to higher levels, enabling us to go beyond self so that we can consider more universal or spiritual issues. The Role of Creativity in Adult Development Clients who are considered to be boomers, or those who are roughly between ages of 44 and 60, are building a foundation now so they can continue to develop, create meaning, and cope with inevitable challenges that come with later years. Building last stage of one's life can be considered a creative act in itself. As Eric Fromm (1959) stated, To be creative means to consider whole process of life as a process of birth, and not to take any stage of life as a final stage. …",

      "abstract": "The Courage Way\r\n\tLeading and Living with Integrity\r\n\tLeadership can be exhausting, lonely, frustrating, disappointing, and downright discouraging. You have to make good decisions while balancing inevitable tensions and knowing when to take risks. You need to keep your values in sight regardless of the pressures around you and stay calm in the storms that arise. At its core, leadership is a daily, ongoing practice, a journey toward becoming your best self and inviting others to do the same. And at the heart of this daily practice is courage.\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd that's where The Courage Way comes in. It's a guide to leadership that names and explores this important resource and shows leaders how to access and draw upon courage in all that they do. It has its roots in the work of Parker J. Palmer, who in fifty years of teaching, speaking, and writing has explored the human spirit—what he has called “the inner landscape”—and its role in life and leadership.\r\n\t\r\n\tShelly Francis identifies key ingredients needed to cultivate courage, the most fundamental being trust—in ourselves and in each other. She describes the Center for Courage & Renewal's Circle of Trust approach, centered around eleven “touchstones,” poetic and practical operating guidelines for holding the meaningful conversations of inner work and trust building. Each chapter features true stories of how leaders in all kinds of settings have overcome challenges and strengthened their organizations through touchstones like “Extend invitation, not demand,” “No fixing, saving, advising, or correcting,” and “When the going gets rough, turn to wonder.”\r\n\t\r\n\tThis graceful and inspiring book is a guide to courageous leadership and a journey of self-discovery—the two are inextricable. As Francis writes, “Courage is not only in you—it is you. In your moments of courage, that's when you meet your true self.”",

It is enough for my purpose that for much of the time our feelings, our emotions, our inclinations are as fluctuating or as imperious as if they were not totally under our control. We are elated: we are dejected: we get angry, and then our anger gives place to a feeling of absurdity: we remain in love with someone who is lost to us but whom we cannot renounce: we are interested in something, and suddenly we are bored, or frightened that we will be bored: we see a stranger, someone who is nothing to us, who is poor or crippled, and we feel guilt: someone does something wrong or foolish, and we are unaccountably transported by laughter, by ‘sudden glory’ as Hobbes called it, knowing what it was about, and then, as unaccountably, we are thrown down.

One of his brothers also died in December, many years ago, and his father died on Christmas day, not quite so many years ago; so in passing at that time of year, Dad was, in a sense, following an unfortunate family tradition. away is an inapt term for my father's dying.

Daďs death was both a struggle against the cancer that proved stronger than he was, and a fight to maintain the protective role he had always had toward us all. What he was trying to protect us from at the last was his own death. Most of us, early ih life, become intensely aware of our fathers in one way or another. We discover that we love them or hate them or are afraid of them or indifferent to them, or perhaps some uncomfortable combination of these possibilities. One of my earliest recollections of my own dad consists of the misapprehension that he was a meeting man/' Some of the children in my kindergarten had been exchanging various fantastic notions of what their fathers did for a living, and I had volunteered the somewhat puzzling information that my daddy was a meeting man, that my civic-minded father went to meetings of Civitan, of the hospital board for a living. It seemed perfectly sensible to me, though it horrified my mother. My most powerful, and I think most accurate, perception of my father, though, was of how remarkable he was. Many of my friends, in fact most of them, seemed to regard their fathers as fairly ordinary. To me, my father was utterly, completely extraordinary. And not just to me, either.

      "title": "AGEING TOWARDS 2000: A CHALLENGE FOR THE RE‐FURBISHMENT OF A SELF",
      "abstract": "Abstract This paper offers the view that individuals need to accept a large measure of responsibility for their journey toward and into old age. The challenge is for people approaching retirement to have the courage and foresight to re‐invent life in its fullest sense. Many Australians are deceptively unprepared for the likely prospect of spending twenty‐five to thirty years in occupational retirement. It is suggested that society needs to encourage individuals during middle‐life and beyond to become portfolio people in the sense that they are prepared to add new dimensions and challenges to their lives. A number of perspectives for positive adaptation to later life are provided in conjunction with a philosophical framework for activating a meaningful and productive leisure lifestyle. A great deal of talent is lost in the world from want of a little courage. Every day sends to their graves obscure men whom timidity prevented from making a first effort; who if they could have been induced to begin, would have in all probability gone great lengths in the career of same. The fact is that to do anything in the world worth doing, we must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger, but jump in and scramble through as well as we can.

      "title": "The End Game",
      "abstract": "The end of life places profound responsibilities on the elderly. To be old is to face the end of life. This is not to say that young people never die. Nor that the old have nothing else to do, no valuable contribution still to make. But after old age comes death. That's simply a biological fact. It will remain a fact regardless of the medical technologies we develop, social programs we institute, and changes we make in our attitudes about aging and the aged. There is a strong taboo in our culture against talking about the end of life, perhaps especially with the elderly. There is even a taboo against talking with a dying person about this central feature of her experience, even when it's obvious to everyone that she is dying. But the elderly know. For some, the body fails before the mind. They feel the approach of death in their joints, their ears and eyes, their lungs, their bowels. Each year, the body performs more poorly than it did the year before. When the body starts to fail, we live with the specter of becoming frail, immobile, eventually debilitated and unable to care for ourselves. For others, the mind fails before the body. When the mind starts to fail, we have more senior moments, and the grace we try to muster on those occasions does not hide the premonition they contain. We become more forgetful, increasingly confused, and more disoriented. Then, too, we live with the specter of dementia, of being unable to care for ourselves, and of death. Even the elderly who are in excellent mental and physical health live in the face of death. For they know life will not last. It cannot last. Probably it will not last much longer. We ought not to pretend otherwise. To face the end of life is not, then, the same as actively dying. It is not even necessarily to carry a terminal diagnosis. Even when there is no terminal illness in sight, one is lurking around the corner. Thus was it ever; thus shall it ever be. So, when we talk about the responsibilities of the elderly, we are talking about the responsibilities of those facing the end of life. Our New Way to Die And yet, our medical technology is changing old age and death. The end of life used to come both earlier and much more quickly. When people commonly died of infections, the span between the onset of a terminal illness and death was often a matter of days, a few weeks at most. Moreover, anyone who became bed-ridden for any length of time would often develop pneumonia, and since pneumonia could not be effectively treated, the bed-ridden died. Under such conditions, few lived to be as old as many now do. People aged, became old much earlier, then usually died fairly quickly. This was accepted; not much could be done. The progress of medicine changed all that. In large part, the change has come since World War II, with the development of effective antibiotics and the respirator. Today, we die of chronic illnesses rather than infections. As a result, the noted geriatrician Joanne Lynn reports that the average American now knows three years in advance what she will die of. Since much is known about most terminal illnesses, a lot is also known about what those three years will be like. Moreover, Lynn reports, the average American male is debilitated for five years before he dies, the average female for eight years before she dies. Today, the elderly live a long time in the face of death. Those of us who are not yet old will quite likely live even longer facing our demise. There is no reason to believe that medical progress will now halt in its tracks. We can expect to have even better treatments for a wide range of killer diseases. Those diseases that we cannot defeat, we will be better able to treat and, thus, to slow. These better treatments for terminal conditions will mean that most of us will live even longer facing death. Most of us will live longer than is common today, decline more slowly, and face even longer periods of disability and debility; and our dying will be much more prolonged than it was for previous generations. …",

It hurts to be bullied and excluded because you have been labelled or set apart and called ugly, fat, stupid, lazy, old, homeless, illiterate, gay, disabled and so on. To be called names, or be labelled, is a form of'othering' that is dis empowering and oppressive. To label another person adversely is careless and insensitive. Negative labels often stay with children and young people for the rest of their lives. Labelling often leads people into believing they are incapable and powerless. Conversely, labelling excuses - even encourages - some individuals to participate in destructive behaviour that upholds certain deficit, racist and homophobic views of the individual. Hurtful labels from careless politicians, parents, relatives, practitioners or teachers are harmful to everyone, especially youth. Name calling and labelling others is a practice that must be rejected and redressed by practitioners working with children and young people. But it is so entrenched in the taken -for-granted and everyday practices of many powerful people, that a formidable strategy is needed to expose the violence oppressive language represents and validates - with the aim of altering it.\r\n\r\nThis chapter puts forth a rationale for authoring counternarratives as a tactic of resistance. It allows those labelled negatively to creatively and critically read and critique the world with the goal of re-writing dominant storylines and discourses. Dominant discourses are generally statements that are institutionally enforced and widely circulated as 'Truths' (Mills, 1997), but which also have the power to alienate and discriminate. Through critical reason and reflection (Barnett, 1997) of their own physical, social, and political 'situationality' (Freire, 1970:90), I encourage practitioners deliberately to create spaces where the children and young people they work with can author counternarratives to reject the often hidden, contextualised and localised (and global) narratives that marginalise them. Historically, counternarratives are recognised for the power they have to challenge and disrupt normative and dominant discourses (Giroux et al, 1996).\r\n\r\nThis chapter presents four counternarratives that work to decentre discourses that render individuals 'docile citizens' (Foucault, 1978/1995). The counternarratives presented do this by exposing and contesting common assumptions around disability, the family and gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans gender (LGBT) youth. Authoring counternarratives gives children and young people a voice to overcome the ways they have been labelled so they no longer remain victims of discrimination, inequity and exclusion. When pupils author counternarratives, they re-appropriate, reframe and challenge dominant images and representations by rupturing the chains of signification to create new narratives that dismantle hegemony.",

To care for one another, to be close to those who are poor, suffering, and marginalized, calls for the strength of meek and humble hearts. The surrender of self into the merciful mystery of Divine Love emboldens us to move in the world with compassionate hearts. For to have compassion, “to suffer with” another, is to long for and take action to address the social ills of our time and place in history. The very heart of compassion is to live with deep respect for one another, to see each person as a true and unique sister or brother. There is a longing in our hearts for a world of peace, justice, and equanimity, a world that is the fruit of compassionate friendship.",

      "abstract": "Stress though inevitable in life is difficult to define precisely. Many events occurring in daily life, brings challenges that impinge upon our minds, bodies and emotions to different extents, subjecting us to stress of various types, namely mental, physical and emotional. Stress, therefore, is a state which an individual finds himself in, when his systems and faculties are unable to measure up to the challenge even by stretching their capacities to the maximum. As a matter of fact, there is an individual variation in stress perception and management, circumstances under which a person perceives stress also have a bearing on it extent and intensity. Consider, for instance, a long distance walk thrust upon an individual not used to walking marathon distance. The exercise proves patently stressful for him. But the same event causes little discomfiture, much less a stress, in a habitual jogger or sprinter. Consider another case, a person running a kilometer on a routine exercise schedule experiencing negligible stress. However, the same person, running the same distance, chased menacingly by a dog would experience an intense stress. Stress perception, therefore, varies from individual to individual and circumstances to circumstances and accordingly varies the body’s response to it.",

      "abstract": "Teachers are among the most compassionate people on the planet. The foundation of our work is caring. We care about people: who they are as students and who they will be as adults. Compassion is “a mental attitude based on the wish for others to be free of their suffering” Compassion compels us to act, but it does not necessarily come easily to all of us. Caring can seem arduous; it can take effort to monitor and revise our reactions to others. Few other professions have workers who feel and display such compassionate attention to so many, every day, over the course of their careers. Some of us enter the profession with boundless compassion; others of us have to learn compassion as situations arise that call for us to show it. And given the amount of tragedy and suffering we are exposed to, how can we muster the ability to show compas­sion? When difficulties threaten, many of us want to bear down, sharpen our defenses, and toughen our resistance. “No matter how much violence or how many bad things we have to go through, I believe that the ultimate solution to our conflicts, both internal and external, lies in returning to our basic or underlying human nature, which is gentle and compassion­ate” (Dalai Lama &amp; Cutler, 1998, 56). The Dalai Lama believes that compassion is the key to hap­piness. Demonstrating our compassion for others can be an antidote to the separateness we sometimes feel. In small, quiet ways, we can show compassion and contribute to a school- wide sense of kinship and affinity.",

      "title": "Modélisation multi-agents d'une crise sismique",
      "abstract": "L’evacuation des populations est necessaire pendant les crises sismiques afin d'attenuer et d'eviter l'exposition a des dangers qui peuvent causer des blessures ou la mort. Tout comme le risque, l’evacuation est de nature sociale. Cela s'explique principalement par le fait que les personnes qui evacuent possedent des strategies sociales tres evoluees pour faire face au danger. La theorie de l'attachement social suppose que la recherche de personnes ou de lieux familiers est realisee en situation de danger. Dans cette situation, les gens recherchent des figures d'attachement. Les figures d'attachement comprennent des personnes, des lieux, des objets familiers, etc. La presence de figures d'attachement favorise le sentiment de calme et de securite. Inversement, leur absence entraine l'anxiete et la fuite. Cela signifie, par exemple, qu'en cas de catastrophe, les personnes peuvent chercher des membres de leur famille avant d'evacuer. Cela explique aussi pourquoi les gens recueillent des biens personnels avant de se diriger vers des sorties et des endroits familiers, ou de suivre des groupes ou des foules, etc.Dans ce contexte, une recherche pluridisciplinaire a ete menee, basee sur les apports des sciences sociales, de la terre, de l’information spatiale et de l’informatique, pour simuler les comportements des individus a la suite d’un seisme dans la ville de Grenoble (France). Dans cette optique, SOLACE, un modele multi-agents sur les evacuations de crise, a nous avons developpe pour repondre a huit questions cles (Q1 a Q8) qui peuvent expliquer la nature et l'impact des comportements d'evacuation humaine modules par les liens sociaux. L'effet de plusieurs parametres sur le nombre d'arrivees dans les zones sures a nous avons observe: il s’agit de l'attachement social (Q1), des connaissances (Q2), du nombre de liens etroits (Q3), de l'heure de la journee (Q4), de la presence d'un handicap (Q5), de la presence de victimes (Q6), de l'intensite du seisme (Q7) et du rayon des zones dangereuses autour des bâtiments (Q8).Les resultats des experiences montrent l'importance des interactions sociales pendant les evacuations. Les comportements des individus sont fortement influences par leur environnement social qui repond aux defis imposes par l'environnement physique produit par les catastrophes sismiques. La capacite et la tendance a l'interaction sociale sont inherentes aux humains et doivent etre prises en compte dans les evacuations. Nous avons demontre que l'attachement social est important parce qu'il peut faciliter le sauvetage d'un plus grand nombre de vies lors de catastrophes sismiques.La premiere et principale contribution de la recherche est d’appuyer les arguments soulignant l'importance du comportement humain et des dynamiques sociales qui emergent lors des evacuations de crise. La deuxieme contribution majeure de l'etude est SOLACE, le modele multi-agents d'evacuation en cas de tremblements de terre mis en œuvre en utilisant l'attachement social. La troisieme contribution majeure est que la recherche confirme l'avantage d'utiliser des donnees spatiales precises dans des modeles dynamiques multi-agents.",

Leisure activities range from highly engaging and meaningful to subjectively trivial. Leisure itself is largely defined by meaning: The essence of leisure lies less in the specific activity than in the subjective perception of freedom, choice, and intrinsic motivation. People desire their lives to be meaningful, and leisure activities offer varying degrees of satisfying the basic needs for meaning (here covered as purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth). Leisure activities vary along multiple conceptual dimensions, such as active vs. passive, seeking vs. escaping, solitary vs. interpersonal, and we consider the implications of these for meaningfulness. The most common leisure activity in modern society, watching television, encapsulates some of the paradoxes of leisure and meaningfulness. The study of how leisure enhances meaning in life is rich and ripe for future research.",

My most frequent mistake is trying to impose my point of view or other personal expectation on a multifaceted world. When we set out to improve life for others without a fundamental understanding of their point of view and quality of experience, we do more harm than good. Often, little more is required than to listen.The best change is one that enables those with plugged ears to hear what the so-called “voiceless” have been voicing all along.When we do set out to actively change systems, it is important that we implement the changes people request of us, or that we at least try to approximate those changes. Sometimes our efforts are imperfect. It is better to implement an imperfect change that improves lives than to insist on an ideologically perfect change that never gets off the ground. We never want to hold others hostage for our own purposes. Negotiation is better than war. Dialogue is better than noise.Sometimes we are faced with implacable opposition to all change. In those circumstances we are forced to abandon negotiation and to fight for justice. Polarization should always be a last resort.",

So likewise in other passions, always provided his opinions remain safe and whole, and.., his reason admit no tainting or alteration, and he in no whit consents to his fright and sufferance. Montaigne, Essays, I. 1 THE STOICS ARE A WEIGHTY EMBARRASSMENTto their friends who, like myself, want to defend them from the charges that their views are at best vague or ludicrous, perhaps offensive or inconsistent. There is no doubt that some of their pronouncements seem material for Aristophanic comedy, others callous and yet others incoherent. And there is also no doubt that they openly defy common sense and deliberately change the terminology they inherit, introducing neologisms ad hoc. And yet, and yet--it is no accident that they continue, rightly continue, to have a powerful hold on ordinary belief and acute philosophical reflection. Here--in what is itself a parody--are some of the commonplaces familiarly attributed to the Stoics.' First, the notorious matter of Stoic apatheia. Diogenes Laertius reports that I believe, but cannot here argue, that despite the signficant differences between early, middle and late Stoics, the classical Stoics shared a common agenda. It is for this reason that I have licensed myself to refer to widely different texts, attempting as best I can to avoid prejudging my case. I think Aulus Gellius is right: \"the fifth book of the Discoursesof Epictetus... as arranged by Arrian undoubtedly agreels] with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus\" (Attic Nights, 19. 1. x4). For a detailed discussion of Seneca's complex relation to the early Stoics, see Brad Inwood, \"Seneca and Psychological Dualism\" inJacques Brunschwig and Martha Nussbaum, eds., Passions and Perceptions (Cambridge, 1993). See alsoJ. M. Rist, Stoic Philosophy(Cambridge, 1969), 201. [3~5] 336 JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 34:3 JULY 1996 the Stoics believe that \"the wise man is apathes, without passions\" (DL 7.1142o ). Seneca presents a stern interpretation of this doctrine: \"Our people [the Stoics] expel passions altogether; the Peripatetics moderate them\" (Sencca, Letters 116.1). The virtuous man, tortured on the rack, having lost children and friends, seeing his city destroyed and the activities of his life come to naught, can avail himself of something--his virtue, his rationality, his philosophic activity; they are the same--that secures his contentment (eudaimonia) (Seneca, Letters, 92.3; Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.4o-4 l, 81-8~; LS 63 L,M).2 But despite his apatheia, the sage is said to have general benign affections (eupatheiai): joy, friendliness, cheerfulness, piety, each of which encompasses a range of more specific attitudes (DL 7.116; LS 65F).s He is vigilant for his improvement, he honors (sebesthai) his parents, is actively devoted to the welfare of his children (philostorgian), and--as his situation permits--takes an active part in politics (DL 7.117-18, 1~o-~1; Cicero, De Fro. 3. 6~-68; LS 57F). How can he serve his parents and children without succumbing to the host ofpathe that such devotion brings, or be active in politics without suffering grief?. How can we understand, let alone endorse, the apparent callousness of a life focused on its own virtue, unmoved by the consequences of the natural activities that it is enjoined to follow, denying that the failures that often attend them are losses to oneself?4 Secondly, obdurate passions--fluttering agitations (ptoiaO that prompt the trouble and turmoil of fruitless endeavors--are mistaken judgments that can be corrected by revising the erroneous beliefs that engender or constitute them. Instead of suffering them passively, we can--as we might say-- \"objectify\" them, observing them with equanimity, concentrating on leading a life of austere virtue. But since passions are also physical states, correcting them seems to involve more than changing one's mind. The Stoic sage must, it seems, have a special kind of constitution. Is his apatheia achieved once and for all, or is it an unending task? And...",

They were always expressed by the questions: What is it for? What does it lead to? At first it seemed to me that these were aimless and irrelevant questions. I thought that it was all well known, and that if I should ever wish to deal with the solution it would not cost me much effort; just at present I had no time for it, but when I wanted to, I should be able to find the answer.

The narrative begins as a single thread but often becomes polysemous, as individuals or small groups pursue minor quests within the overall framework. Quest fantasies conventionally start in a place of security and stability, and then a disruption from the outside world occurs. The protagonist, generally an average person with hidden abilities, receives a call to action and reluctantly embarks on the first adventure. Choice is crucial in quest fantasy, so protagonists face several cruxes where their choices determine the fate of many. After the hero and company pass the first test and receive rewards such as magic items, a respite, often characterized by feasting and music in a haven under the protection of a wisdom figure, occurs during which the members of the company receive aid and knowledge.",

      "title": "The Need to Trust and to Trust More Wisely in Academe.",
      "abstract": "Throughout history, the building blocks of all compelling narratives have remained intact: Challenge, struggle, and resolution. The stories that hold us captive surface an unexpected challenge, narrate the emotional struggle to overcome that challenge, and galvanize the listener's response with a resonant resolution that calls one to action (Guber, 2011). Human beings enter the world confronted with a daunting challenge: Being physically premature and highly dependent on caretakers. that sense, newborns struggle physically and emotionally to make social connections. The evidence is engaging: one hour of birth, a human infant will draw her head back to look into the eyes of the person gazing at her. Within a few more hours, the infant will orient her head the direction of her mother's voice. And, unbelievable as it may seem, it's only a matter of hours before the infant can actually mimic a caretaker's expressions (Kramer, 2009, p. 70). a word, newborns are greeted with a clarion call to action: To be engaging and engaged, connecting and connected, sup porting and supported (Mintzberg, 2009, p. 235). Building Trusting Relationships Academe: The Challenge Colleagues sense intuitively that academic units cannot function optimally without a bedrock level of trust. Trustworthiness requires character, the desire to act a trustworthy way, and competence, the ability to perform the entrusted task (Covey, 2004). Exceptional leaders seek to cultivate trust as an integral part of their organization's culture. a culture based on trust, relationships are aligned through core values, a noble cause, and a generosity of spirit. Values align the life-giving social space between committed colleagues, no matter the cost. A noble cause captures the highest aspirations of groups of colleagues by asking: In service of what? Core values are what colleagues stand in and a noble cause is what colleagues shoot (Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright, 2008, p. 169). Trusting relationships academe are a function of wondering aloud: activities will allow us to express our core values and move the direction of our noble cause? Trusting relationships academe are also a by-product of conceptualizing one's academic unit as a learning organization. an authentic learning organization, colleagues with the most authority and established knowledge make it psychologically safe for others to speak freely when they do not understand something or sense that something is amiss. that sense, humble inquiry is an expression of a trust-based culture. Trust equilibrates the relationship between vulnerable colleagues requesting information, seeking technical assistance, or pleading for understanding from colleagues with more established knowledge and experience (Schein, 2009). What is more profound and essential than merely feeling good about one's colleagues an academic setting is the need for a perceived sense of collegial interdependence. Ultimately, trust-based relationships reveal an authentic generosity of spirit coupled with a palpable sense of perceived interdependence (Pinchot, 1998). Learning to function interdependently is pivotal to building and sustaining trust-based cultures. cardiac surgical units, for example, the surgeon, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, and nurse are immersed an immediate, here-and-now interdependence. that environment, subordinates are expected to assist superiors without hesitation, as the patient's life hangs the balance (Schein, 2009). Silence the operating room or the cockpit, for example, carries a heavy price. Outliers, Gladwell (2008) reviewed data from numerous airline accidents. He concluded that the errors that cause plane crashes are invariably errors of a lack of perceived interdependence, teamwork, and communication. One pilot, for instance, knows something important but chooses not to share with the copilot. …",

I was told I could not live the life that I wanted and that I would need medication forever. I was never told I could recover. My journey was not an easy one and there were many occasions when I wanted to give up. Throughout my journey I discovered the importance of understanding my human experience thus far and how past events and experiences have shaped me into the person I am today. The story of recovery is still not a common enough story, but the possibilities of recovery are endless! Recovery is much more than becoming stable; it's about bettering who you are and finding meaning. Recovery was made possible for me by people having hope that I could find myself again; people seeing past the so-called illness and seeing something in me, something worthwhile. My story is common.

      "abstract": "Waiting? Oh, yeah, I hate that!\" Waiting occupies a significant place in the experience of parents and educators.Think of how often and how long we wait with patience, fretfulness, expectation, or even helplessness for a child to get out of diapers, to learn to talk, to ride a bike, to overcome fear of water, to swim, to read, and so on.Waiting is a far from trivial matter in our day-to-day pedagogic lives.In a sense waiting is so familiar a topic that we feel we know only too well what the meaning of waiting is.And yet we would have diffi culty describing the experience of waiting in a particular situation.Moreover, there are different kinds of waiting.There are differences between, say, waiting for our paychecks and waiting for spring to arrive, waiting for the bus to come and waiting for a child to walk, waiting for the end of a movie and waiting for death.On the one hand, waiting may mean simply boredom, an inefficient use of time, empty and unproductive time.But on the other, it may also mean a critically important time which, for example, somehow helps nurture understanding and expression in children, or allows for the appreciation of a good meal at a restaurant, just as it serves quietly to ferment good wine.1 Although, even people who feel that the value of waiting is important in teaching may become easily irritated if they must wait a little too long.They may be overtly waiting while suppressing their impatience, but is this \"real\" waiting?What is real waiting? Manifold Ways of WaitingA small child comes home tired and hungry from playing outside.Mother says, \"Supper is almost ready.\"But the child can hardly wait.\"Can't I have a cookie now?\" Yet mother is firm and the child throws a tantrum.When miserable, how difficult it is to wait!One morning we wake up too early and we wait silently in bed for the dawn and for the family to awaken.What a tranquil experience!When we reach school age, we wait for recess time, for summer and other vacations filled with expectations.They seem to approach so slowly.Holidays are long in coming!And even at the end of a school day the hands of the clock seem to move deliberately slowly until finally the bell rings.",

      "abstract": "Genevieve Lloyd THE SELF AS FICTION: PHILOSOPHY AND AUTOBIOGRAPHY And so it goes on. All the time I'm dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind, lovingly, stealthily, not openly adoring it, for if I did that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand at once for a book in self-protection. Indeed it is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original to be believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious at all? It is a matter of great importance. Suppose the looking-glass smashes, the image disappears, and the romantic figure with the green of forest depths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell of a person which is seen by other people — what an airless, shallow, bald, prominent world it becomes! A world not to be lived in. Virginia Woolf, \"The Mark on the WaIl\" ' The anxiety Virginia Woolf describes is, at one level, a familiar, everyday one of self-esteem. But the passage can also be read as expressing a more metaphysical unease about our conception ofwhat it is to be a self at all. Our difficulties in preventing the \"romantic figure with the green of forest depuis all about it\" from collapsing back into mat \"shell of a person which is seen by other people\" have philosophical roots. We have inherited ideals of objective knowledge which put severe restraints on the capacity to construct our selves as fictions. Our selves are part ofthe world and our representations of mem must conform to standards of truth. Yet we also want to separate our selves out from the world we know. As a knowing self, I am not merely an object of knowledge, but its luminous, though elusive, source and structuring center. My subjectivity seems to give me a special status in the world. But it is difficult to see how mat special status is to be reconciled with ideals of objective knowledge. As Thomas Nagel sums up the philosophical dilemma, in Mortal Questions , we are impelled, on the one hand, to resist an entirely \"external\" view ofwhat we most essentially are and do. But this sense ofour irreduci168 Genevieve Lloyd169 ble subjectivity comes up against an equally strong drive to include human beings and everything about diem as contents of a world mat can be understood \"objectively.\" Our awareness of ourselves involves a sense of how the world is experienced from a particular point of view. But this idea of what the world is like from different points of view is at odds with our inherited ideals ofknowledge. To qualify as real, diings must be there independendy of particular points of view. Objectivity demands setting aside the \"internal\" viewpoint in an attempt to see die world, as it were, from no point of view at all. Yet we do feel mat our awareness of being ourselves cannot be reduced to the awareness of being the particular persons with the determinate properties we have, there to be perceived from perspectives not our own.2 As Arthur Prior puts the point, in his paper \"Identifiable Individuals,\" an exchange of properties between Julius Caesar and Mark Antony might leave the world looking exacdy the same to us, but certainly not to Caesar or Antony. The experience of being called Julius Caesar or being murdered on me ides of March are very different experiences from being called Mark Antony or dallying on the Nile with Cleopatra.3 This seems to suggest mat my awareness ofbeing myself cannot be equated wim awareness of being some person with a determinate set of properties. It was, of course, precisely that kind of consideration which prompted Descartes, in the Meditations, to postulate the self as a pure ego, which remains the same regardless ofany imagined change in outer circumstances. It is the thought experiment of shedding all his actual properties which prompts him to treat the self as a special kind of object, immune to the fluctuations and uncertainties that afflict others. But, as Bernard Williams has pointed out, in his article \"Imagination and...",

All kinds of worries—worries about losing people and things, worries about how we seem to others—keep us from peace of mind. Distracted or misled by our preoccupations, misconceptions, and, most of all, our obsession with ourselves, we do not see the world clearly—we do not see the world as it really is. In our search for happiness and the good life, this is the main problem. But luckily there is a solution, and on the path to understanding it, we can make use of the rich and varied teachings that have developed over centuries of Buddhist thought. This book explores the central elements of centuries of Buddhist philosophy and practice, explaining how they can improve life and teach us how to live without fear. Mining important texts and lessons for practical guidance, it provides a guide to the very practical goals that underpin Buddhist philosophy. After laying out the basic ideas, the text walks readers through a wide range of techniques and practices we can adopt to mend ingrained habits.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Knut Rauchfuss: „The Tragedy starts, after the Crimes have ended“. A Culture of Impunity impedes the Rehabilitation of Severe Human Rights Violations Survivors. Reports from different countries and conflicts demonstrate that impunity is one of the key obstacles for stabilization and rehabilitation of severe human rights violations survivors. Impunity is not only the absence of legal justice but a social phenomenon, which includes incomplete truth finding, missing integral reparation, a lack of structural reforms, as well as the inability to overcome the legal protection of perpetrators assured by impunity laws. In this context survivors are hardly able to achieve the necessary integration of their traumatic experiences into their own biography, to accomplish the restoration of their destroyed life scripts and the rebuild self-confidence and selfdetermination. Mental health problems resulting from traumatic experiences can persist or be activated any time by certain daily events even years later. In particular, family members of the forcibly disappeared suffer from an incomplete mourning due to the uncertain fate of their loved ones. The ongoing search for the disappeared in an atmosphere of impunity places family members at high risk for retraumatization. Due to the global character of impunity there is expected to be only little evidence for the positive impact of justice on mental health. Nevertheless, such evidence does exist, showing that impunity not only creates a strong barrier to a sustainable recovery, but it prolongs and deepens the traumatic experience.",

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>Establishing and maintaining a meaningful, satisfying, and enduring intimate relationship can be elusive for many people. Time and again, they are drawn to lovers with whom the relationship is futile, ending with hurt feelings and regrets. In this work, Nina Brown shares her longtime experience as a professional counselor to help those who ask: Why do I keep picking unsuitable lovers? Brown calls them dead-end lovers, and in this work she shows us, not only how to spot them early and avoid them, but also what it is—what psychological needs we have —that attracts us to them.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Guided by decades of counseling those with relationship problems, Brown includes 17 clear signals of unsuitability, and tells us how to spot the five types of unsuitable lovers: Hurting and Needy, Risk-Taking and Rebellious, Charming and Manipulative, Self-absorbed, or Exotic and Different. To help us understand why we are drawn to them, she explains the personal psychological lures and attractions we may have—from Being a Saver, to Searching for Excitement, Craving Attention and Admiration, Finding a Mirror, and Rebellion against Convention. She also explains why entering into a relationship expecting to change another person is most often just an exercise in futility.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Perhaps most important, Brown details how we can move ahead and find true intimacy by pinpointing the components of a satisfying and meaningful intimate relationship, increasing interpersonal effectiveness, strengthening our psychological boundaries, resisting lures, managing emotions, and becoming aware of potential personal romantic illusions.</JATS1:p>",

      "title": "Tesseract Optimization for Data Privacy and Sharing Economics",
      "abstract": "As human beings, we have the inherent bias towards our likes and dislikes. These likes and dislikes are influenced by our psychographic attributes, morals, values, beliefs and societal networks in both circles of influence and circles of concern. We continuously consume products, services as well as produce products and services for others to consume. Due to our inherent bias of likes and dislikes, we unintentionally or intentionally end up liking products and/or services that are personalized for us, or somehow unintentionally match our likes. This personalization makes our lives easier and more comfortable as it may save time, and/or enable us to achieve desired experiences. This personalization is influenced by the data gathered about us directly or indirectly. The richer the data is about us, the more personalized products and services we receive, thereby saving us time and money whilst meeting our desired goals for experience or exchange of value for the offers we are wanting. We remain forever concerned about the direct or accidental use of our data that can fall into the hands of nefarious users of the dark web, or criminals who can cause us all kinds of harm using the data we shared. Herein lies the paradox of personalization and privacy. To solve this paradox, we acknowledge that there has to be a trade-off between data privacy and personalization, and an optimized match on trust, value etc. between the data owners (data subjects) and data buyers. In this paper, we propose approaches to handle these trade-offs in an optimized way with the acceptance threshold determined by a methodology to optimize the match between trust and value perceptions specific to an individual, and in context of the trust we place on the data controller, processor or buyer entity with which we share and entrust our data for the exchange of value provided.",

      "title": "Playing, Childlike Adult",
      "abstract": "Abstract Holding aside the specifics of stages once more, Erikson’s writings provide a wealth of insight into play and potential childlikeness in the grown adult and about how one might reclaim some of childhood’s lost power. It was clear to him that too many persons lose vitality, joy, and a sense of wonder enroute to full adulthood. To Erikson, the adult version of play exists in ideas and plans, in drama and scenarios, in visions, models, and worldviews. But childlikeness is an entirely different matter, a giant step beyond play. Adult childlikeness requires combining play with wonder and trust, a blend found only in the rarest of persons. Further, in the broad span of life called “maturity,” Erikson found that only the most extraordinary adult could see in children generally, and in his or her own internalized child specifically, anything other than weaknesses that had to be variously restrained, controlled, or brought up to stature. By full adulthood, wonder, the ability to see things delightfully anew, had been forfeited, and distrust and cynicism had replaced much of childhood’s trust. This is one reason for Erikson’s change in the negative poles for adult resolutions. He saw that identity, in its evolving adult forms, cannot coexist with cynicism, isolation, and rejection. Solid development, positive adaptation, and good mental health require acceptance of oneself, of other persons, and of viable social roles, instead of role refusal, withdrawal, stagnation, and bitterness mixed with self-disgust.1",

But something is awry; the way we are evidently treating the unborn generations to come, by polluting our world and using its 'resources' up as if there were no tomorrow, makes one wonder if in fact these claims and these devotions hide an unpleasant truth: that we are not in fact taking care of future people.

      "abstract": "What compels an adolescent in emotional pain to contemplate suicide? Australia has one of the highest rates of adolescent suicide in the world. Susan Alldred-Lugton proposes that the absence or presence of 'creativity' is a crucial determinant in an adolescent's 'wish to die' or 'will to live'. She draws on Klein, Jung, Bion and others to explore the forces that often impede this important human quality. An individual who experiences their creativity as blocked, may ask 'What else is there?' Alldred-Lugton challenges theories that locate developmental trauma in the early years of life. She proposes that young people with a secure attachment style and a fairly uneventful life without any major trauma, may experience bad luck or a major trauma as such a surprise they simply don't know how to handle it. For some young people and their families, this can occur at the time when the young person wants to separate from their parents and is caught in the struggle to move from being a child to becoming a sexual individual. The therapeutic task in work with suicidal adolescents is to reignite the creative process and restore resilience. Assessment issues, work with parents, and the often neglected issue of sleep deprivation are considered. (editor abstract)",

      "abstract": "Discover a pastoral approach to depression that combines Eastern wisdom and Western science!Wu Wei, Negativity, and Depression reveals a way to break the cycle of depression, not by denying it or fighting it, but by the ancient principle of wu wei, non-trying. The bleak cycle of depression starts when people experience negativity. They turn inward to try to find self-esteem, but the negativity strips all the power of self-affirmation from them. The gap between is and ought--how they see themselves and how they want to be--is too great to bridge. The cycle known as self-regulatory perseveration means that depressed persons are caught in a desperate, fruitless search for affirmation. Instead of self-esteem, they find self-criticism and further negative thoughts. Yet they keep looking . . . and looking . . . and looking. The more they look for self-worth inside, the less they find, and the harder they try--the cycle continues. When trying simply doesn't work, wu wei, the principle of letting go, may help break that cycle. When trying simply doesn't work, wu wei, not-trying, may help. Wu wei is the principle of letting go. By giving up on the self-imposed and unattainable oughts and shoulds, the depressed person stops focusing on self. Wu wei breaks the cycle of negativity, allowing the depressed person to begin to heal.Wu Wei, Negativity, and Depression offers a comprehensive discussion of depression, including: epidemiology of depression etiology and biological causes psychosocial theories standard treatments of the past and present pastoral care of depressed persons This important book constructs a possible approach to depressed souls weary of fighting and trying to fix themselves. Wu Wei, Negativity, and Depression can bring new hope to those who most need it.",

      "title": "I BELIEVE SO THAT I MIGHT UNDERSTAND: AN EPISTEMIC STUDY ON THE RELATION OF BELIEF TO KNOWLEDGE IN SAINT AUGUSTINE",
      "abstract": "If we weren’t creatures hungry to believing, we could not reach to the belief. The confirmation of the need to believing depends upon the mind’s awareness of its limits. Life is so short that, if we wait all of our questions to be answered, our life does not suffice. Probably no people live so long to get immediate and individual knowledege of all truths. Besides, belief is brought to be necessary by the constraints of human knowledge. Non of us never can be in a stuation in which we can know every thing immediately. Every time there are a great many truths that should be approved depending on the testimony of some authorities. We know much more thing via belief than that we know via experience untill now and those things are much more important from the point of our spiritual and wordly happiness. Once we decide not to believe any thing that we comprehend by means of our senses, than no human institution can remain robust. Faith also stands in the foundation of love and respect. As paralel to his those thoughts, Augustine’s understanding of knowledge is opposite to the contemporary empirical understanding. Contemporary empirical understanding allocates knowledge to the assertions which are believed by people depending upon a robust evidence when they are true. However, for Augustine (AD 354-430), basic knowledge is belief. Belief is necessary, because it’s antecedent to understanding temporarily. The person who don’t believe will not understand. Because the people who don’t believe will not experience and the people who don’t experience will not know. It’s our duty to understand what we believe in sincerely and to get sight of rationality of our belief. Understanding is not only getting an additional evidence for belief to justify belief, but also in understanding foundations of belief or meaning of the thing believed or both of them become more robust..

And how is this challenge dealt with in literature and in life? I argue that problems connected to entering adult working life may generate the same issues as entering life as pensioner, since without a meaningful job, our prospect of a good and dignified life is weakened.",

      "abstract": "time, love, paralyzing doubt and uncertainty, loyalty, fear, freedom, goodness. These things, then, and many more. One might expect such fundamental constituents and conditions of our being to be there ? palpable, radiant, pressing. To a significant extent, of course, they are. It is hard to miss them, even though Dick does a masterful job of not playing up the agonies and wrenchings of the most troubled of the voices to which he listens. (I set aside the not uninteresting question of what it would mean to exaggerate death or pain or fear.) Yet, the world of the ill and their loved ones is not quite as much there ? palpable and pressing - as one might think. When we find ourselves in what Jaspers called the boundary situation of illness and imminent death ? our own or someone we love ? some things become clear and other things become unclear. This opacity would be interesting in its own phenomenological right, but it is even more pronounced and arresting as we watch the constituents of our being bumped and pushed through the narrow hallway of decision. If one is not careful, impalpabilities and intangibles will slip and drop in this hallway, leaving the patient or loved one with less than what they need and should have. This is where Dick Zaner comes in. He helps those who must respond to illness ? patient, family members, physician, nurse, technician, friend ? to remain vigilant even as their rational, emotional, and spiritual resources are tested by the need to make decisions they would prefer not to make. In the remainder of my paper I should like to offer some remarks and a question or two in connection with the vigilance kept by Dick on behalf of those who are ill and those who care for the ill. I shall focus my remarks on what I take to be the book's two centers, phenomenological centers. I turn first to what might be called the emergent theory of decision.",

      "abstract": "6 ive me a break! This expression appears to be an imperative or a request. \\J In colloquial English, it can be either, or it can be uttered with various degrees of irony as a complaint, an objection, or a reproof. I want to begin by considering it in a relatively serious way, by asking what it means to ask some one to give, and to a break. According to some analyses in a certain dis course on the gift (for example, in Nietzsche, Bataille, Levinas, and Derrida), the gift is always a of some sort. It is an interruption, an excess, an incal culable intervention. It breaks with a circle or cycle of economic exchange, of debt and credit. A true gift (to borrow one of Emerson's terms) cannot be one that was anticipated or one for which return is expected. In one sense, then, reading very literally, give me a break is a tautology, for it says give me a gift, where the gift is understood as rupture and disruption. Or perhaps the requested is for me, for the speaker of the phrase, who asks for special consideration; while it may be recognized that there are a set of laws or rules in place that all are expected to follow, the speaker appeals to his or her special circumstances, including perhaps a relation to the one addressed. So it can be come a demand for justice, for that absolutely unique justice that escapes rule and law. More specifically, in terms of common usage, the expression is fre quently a request for time, for freedom from some constraints or expectations, possibly a petition to be released from a deadline, or from some constrictive schedule. It asks for a in time, a from or interruption in a rigorous agenda; it asks for something like an intercalary day, as in the time given at New Year's in Babylon when there was a festive day that did not appear on the calen dar, but that was understood to be available for carnivalesque reversals of and variations on normative social codes. The gift and time?these two themes come together in recent texts such as Derrida's Given Time (1992), but also in Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay Gifts (see Emerson 1990), which I propose to read. Give me a then, seems to encapsulate much of what current thought has to say about the gift. And yet, if we now attend to the phrase as request or demand, rather than to its presumed object, the break, it begins to seem not tautologous, but self-contradictory, for surely there is something deeply prob",

      "title": "GABRIEL MARCEL’S PHILOSOPHY OF “THE OTHER:” A MEANS TO BEING HUMAN.",
      "abstract": "It is believed that, ‘unity is power.’ Unfortunately, we are gradually losing interest in each other. Presence and availability to the other is very much challenged by the modernity, new life styles and the advancement of science and technology. Electronic gadgets distance us from encountering and being available to those around us. Think of many people walking with earphones listening to different audios and videos or playing videogames in places where they could encounter the new other. This leads to the individualistic life, whereby, due to lack of an experience with ‘the other,’ one does not see the value of the other and assumes that life can go on without the other. It is others who make us visible and important in whatever we do. We are able to focus on whatever we are doing because we know that; there is the other person who is somewhere, either waiting for my service or waiting for me to fail and replace me. So without the other, most of our doings are meaningless. To make this louder, one can just imagine, how could life be, if he was alone in the whole universe. Life is to be lived in the society where healthy relationship between the self and ‘the other’ is of great value. This article is a call for us to live related with others amidst all the challenges that may hinder or discourage our human relations. There is power in unity and communion than in self-hood. In order for us to claim that we are in a particular human interaction with the other, our relation should not be superficial but intrinsic to the level of ‘communion.’ This communion must be leavened by meaningful presence, availability and communication. Meaningful presence is more than being there physically, it is also spiritual. Availability goes deeper to disposability of oneself to the other. Communication is not only in understanding the symbolic meaning of the words but understanding the human condition of a person. One relates well with the self when he or she is able to relate well with the other. This is Gabriel Marcel’s call through his philosophy of ‘the other’ as it is discussed in this article.",

      "abstract": "Purpose – The topic of forecasting and our (in)ability to predict the future should be regularly revisited as our memories seem incredibly short and forgiving of inaccurate and false predictions, as well as our failure to predict what should have been obvious. Forecasting is a critical stage of the strategizing process. Why are we still getting it wrong? Design/methodology/approach – Using a conceptual approach, this paper warns against placing too much faith in our predictive (in)abilities and attempts to address the question of why we continue to seek out and trust a flawed industry that profits from false prophecy. Findings – Humans have always found comfort in soothsayers and mystics. Where once they came in the guise of tribal witch doctors, today many appear as economists, strategists, and consultants. Our need for security is readily exploited by people claiming to know the future. We receive pleasure from the act of cooperation and therefore prefer to believe rather than disbelieve. We place faith in myths rather than facts, and we fail to see what in hindsight should have been obvious. Originality/value – This paper acts as a warning. Forecasting is about identifying patterns and themes and designing multiple response scenarios. Myths and magic have no place in the modern business world, and those who claim to “know” the future are really only speculating or lying – no one can “see” the future. Strategists can only reflect on the past, speculate in an informed manner, and design multiple alternative responses. The anomalous event, the pattern breaker, the surprise, will always be with us. The best we can do is to prepare for what might occur, and operate on the basis that just because something has been with us for a long time, it may not be with us forever.",

There are preexisting, independent factors that would be present even if he were not, and they determine the context of any situation. Context is easier to understand when the authors consider extreme examples of it: jail, war, famine, earthquakes. While it is relatively easy to be sensitive to extreme contexts, it is often difficult for people, Millennials in particular, to be sensitive to more subtle contexts, particularly when they walk into new situations. Millennials, brand new to a workplace, are often lured into cliques or distracting personal relationships by one social ringleader or another.",

      "title": "Dislocation after disaster: What does ‘returning home’ mean?",
      "abstract": "The shock and disruption of an extreme event – an earthquake that shattered apartment buildings, shops, schools and hospitals, or a tsunami that virtually obliterates a city, or a flood that has washed away roadways, bridges and infrastructure – leaves an unforgettable impact on the affected community. With their homes ripped away, basic services like water, power and gas distribution systems damaged and dysfunctional, social institutions like mosques, churches and schools no longer able to serve the community, people leave devastated areas. “Just for a short time,” some tell themselves. “Only until we can rebuild,” others state tentatively. “The pain of loss is too great; we will never return,” still others assert. The dilemma of how to cope with the loss of physical infrastructure following a damaging event is compounded by the loss of the social connections, economic livelihoods and the landscape of familiar neighbourhoods, workplaces, personal artefacts and memories that give life meaning. This dilemma creates both personal and professional choices that cannot be ignored. Whatever choice is made will shape the next stage in the life of a family, a business, a neighbourhood, a city or the larger region that experienced the disaster. Yet, those choices are never made by individuals alone, and the choices regarding rebuilding physical infrastructure are taken in the context of how long it will take to rebuild the social and economic networks essential to give life meaning, and how thoughtfully the emotional content of what was lost can be reimagined into hopeful new beginnings. In Türkiye, this dilemma is occurring on multiple levels simultaneously after the Kahramanmaraş Earthquakes on 6 February 2023. The devastating earthquakes affected a vast area that included 11 provinces, 10 cities with smaller districts, towns, and villages and 13 million residents. At this point, over 3.5 million residents have left the area, and scattered across the country. Some refugees from conflict zones in Syria returned to Syria, after losing whatever stability they had gained in Turkish communities damaged by the earthquakes. The difficult plight of the Syrian refugees who were living in the earthquake-affected zone is discussed in more detail by Turkish authors Eda Sevinin, Didem Danış, Deniz Sert in their thoughtful commentary, Double Displacement of Refugees in the context of the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquake, this issue. Scientific studies are documenting with new detail the earthquake fault lines that traversed the region, mapping areas that will likely generate seismic risk again in a future decade or century. Seismic risk is a known risk; it will return, but no one knows exactly when, where or with what severity. Rebuilding a neighbourhood, a community, or a city after the disaster is a massive task; it cannot be done by individuals alone, or even cities or provinces alone. Attempts by national governments to create resettlement plans for survivors following extreme events have not always been successful, and for many displaced families, such centralized solutions have created living situations in which they are worse off than before the disaster. In her commentary, Melissa Quetulio-Navarra portrays the painful consequences of such a national program, Philippine's Housing Commitment as a Preventive Resettlement Strategy for Informal Settler Families, in this issue. The challenge is how can the complex effort of housing for damaged areas be designed to recreate a vital, livable, functioning community while residents remaining are still grieving and many have left, uncertain of a viable future. The choices involve a complex set of interconnected feedback loops. At the national level, if, as announced, a major investment is made in rebuilding housing, are there also funds for reconstructing the services of water, power and transportation needed to support the return of residents to occupy that housing? Will businesses return to previous locations to provide groceries, gasoline and garden tools without customers? Will residents have jobs to support their families if they do return? Which investment comes first, housing, lifeline services, businesses, schools or places of worship? These choices are also made at an individual level, as families weigh the cost and strain of rebuilding against the problematic status of living in a city under construction without access to adequate health, medical, employment and educational services. Türkiye has seen this dilemma before, but the hardwon lessons from the Marmara and Duzce Earthquakes in 1999 regrettably failed to translate newly designed policies and building codes into practice to build stronger, more resilient communities across the nation (Comfort, 2019). Such changes, if implemented, would have substantially avoided the bitter losses and enormous destruction incurred only 24 years later in the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes. Ironically, a slim, positive outcome may result from the dispersion of 3.5 million residents of the earthquake-affected region across Türkiye. They will likely share their experience with the horror of collapsed buildings, their inability to rescue loved ones calling them from under the rubble, their shattered hopes for lives lost and plans foregone with others in other areas of this country with high seismic risk. The 13 million residents of the earthquake-damaged region represent approximately 15 percent of the Turkish population of 84.6 million. This significant proportion of the population could articulate vividly the reality of seismic risk and engage others in demanding long-term investment in buildings and infrastructure that do not fail. Halvard Buhaug raises the question of ‘good’ vs. ‘bad’ displacement of the population following disaster events in his commentary, What's in a number? Some reflections on disaster displacement modelling, this issue. Türkiye, as an ancient civilization, has vivid evidence of seismic risk over the centuries in the ruins of once-thriving cities like Pergamon, Ephesus and historical sites in old Antakya that were likely lost to the powerful forces of earthquakes that ancient inhabitants likely did not recognize nor understand. Recurring devastation from natural hazards is not confined to Turkey, as Ahsan Kamal notes in his commentary, Climate and Migration, on repeated severe flooding over 150 years in Pakistan, this issue. In contrast, in 2023, the scientific and technical capacity of Türkiye has changed dramatically. The earthquake faults have been mapped; after the 1999 earthquakes, Türkiye has updated its building codes to the equivalent of those in California and Japan. There are 120,000 civil engineers in Türkiye who have the skills and knowledge to design and build buildings that withstand seismic shaking, as evidenced by newer buildings in Gaziantep and Kahramanmaraş that emerged from this latest earthquake sequence largely undamaged. As a middle income country, Türkiye likely has the economic capacity to redesign communities with new buildings that will not fail. Choices made today in the design, construction and renewal of the damaged region will shape the next decades of sustainability and resilience for Turkish communities, large and small. Other nations, facing similar seismic risk, have opted to invest in technologies to monitor seismic risk more carefully and communicate that risk more systematically throughout the nation. Japan, for example, has invested in an earthquake monitoring system that reports the occurrence of seismic movement electronically to every household to alert residents to danger. California, confronting seismic risk similar to that in Türkiye, has passed a series of changes to building codes over decades that require construction of buildings to standards that will not collapse and kill occupants. Professional engineering associations are now advocating standards for functional recovery of building operations within a reasonable period after an earthquake to hasten recovery for a damaged community. Informed changes implemented over time have demonstrated that it is possible to live with seismic risk. Previous leaders in Türkiye have gambled with recurrent seismic risk that has characterized the country for centuries, betting the odds that the earthquakes would not occur under their authority. Yet, telling evidence from the ruins of once splendid Roman and Greek cities constructed centuries ago belies the continuing danger of shifting tectonic plates in the country. This unfortunate practice is not limited to Turkey. In El Salvador, an earthquake in 1969 damaged the Ruben Dario Building, a five-story building that housed shops and businesses in downtown San Salvador. The building was condemned by structural engineers after the 1969 earthquake, but the owner paid a modest penalty, plastered over the cracks, repainted the walls and resumed business operations. Seventeen years later on October 10, 1986, a moderate Mw = 5.4 earthquake at 11:49 am under the centre of the city brought the entire building down, killing an estimated 200 people who had been working or shopping in the building (Comfort, 1999). For decision-makers who roll the seismic dice, loss is certain at some unknown future time. If the population that recently migrated from the earthquake-damaged region to other areas of the country will share their experience of loss, heartbreak, disruption and pain with their neighbours, the empathy engendered may allow their neighbours to comprehend the need for continuing vigilance in building communities resilient to seismic risk and the possibility of alternative visions of recovery. In sharing their experience, knowledge, insight and pain, those dislocated from the damaged communities can contribute to shaping a common understanding of investment in homes that will not collapse. In Indonesia, the trauma of the 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed an estimated 125,000 Indonesians and claimed more than 100,000 lives in other countries that rim the Indian Ocean, initiated a determined international effort to develop the Indian Ocean Tsunami Mitigation and Warning System. Launched in 2005 after the tragedy, the IOTMWS is operational today, 2023, with 28 member nations, 24 of which are actively engaged in tsunami mitigation and preparedness (Comfort & Rahayu, 2023). As Türkiye copes with the massive losses from the 6 February 2023 earthquakes, the essential task is not simply designing a plan to reconstruct buildings in the short-term, but insistence on the quality of construction and the commitment to long-term sustainability for communities in regions of recurring risk. Such insistence comes foremost from the people who understand the risk and who can envision homes and infrastructure that do not fail. Advanced technologies in recording losses through drone overflights and video cameras provide digital memories that can easily be shared and exchanged. Social media can now facilitate the exchange of ideas and empathy that enable the healing transition from grief to action. The losses endured by this generation in 2023 may then lead to resilience and sustainability for succeeding generations. For example, in the Nepali town of Bhotsipa in Sindhupalchowk District, where homes, schools and workplaces collapsed in the 25 April 2015 earthquake, the townspeople gathered 1 year later on 30 April 2016 to celebrate the opening of a new school for grades 1–8. The school was constructed with funds donated by alumni from a private high school in Kathmandu who wanted to see the children of the village thrive. The pride of the new school was not only a library but a new computer room, with seven desktop computers and an internet connection that would allow children in this remote Himalayan village to interact with other children 10,000 miles away. Similarly, with the collaborative support of their neighbours and the nation, the people dislocated by the earthquakes in the Kahramanmaraş region may begin to return to a safer ‘home’ in a newly imagined and resilient community.

Because she knows her time to die has come, because she knows she is dying and awaits what cannot be foreseen or confronted—because she somehow finds, in patience, the strength for this lucidity—she makes no unrealistic demands on the medical staff and does not search for blame in others or in her own past. And it is just that that strikes us as her dignity. But that was not an objective; it is a side effect. We are unable to witness such a dying without envy, without longing to be able to die that way, when our time comes. It motivates us to wish to live with dignity.",

      "title": "Obsessions and compulsions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessional disorders are characterised by the occurrence of intrusive and upsetting thoughts which the patient usually regards as senseless, and which are accompanied by the urge to 'put right' or neutralise. Compulsive, overt behaviour such as repetitive washing or checking is the most obvious form of neutralising, but neutralising may also take the form of cognitive behaviours, such as thinking a 'good thought' whenever an obsessional intrusion occurs. Neutralising behaviour, either cognitive or overt, usually occurs repetitively and is often identified as the principal problem leading to the patient seeking treatment. For example, a patient was referred because of repetitive hand washing. On interview, he reported that two years previously he had read about a toddler dying after drinking from a bottle of domestic bleach. Since that time, he had been troubled by the thought that he had become contaminated by bleach and could harm others as a result. This led him to wash his hands repeatedly, taking up to an hour at a time, several times every day. When he tried to stop, he had the thought, 'What if I missed some bleach and touched my baby son?' When this thought occurred, he had a terrifying image of his son's face, horribly distorted, and his wife reproaching him for his carelessness and the death of their child. He would then have the thought, 'I can't risk it, just for the sake of washing for five minutes.'",

      "title": "Culture and the Differentiation of Emotional States",
      "abstract": "The experience of another person is never directly available to us, just as our own experiences cannot be directly experienced by other people. ‘We're all of us sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins' (Tennessee Williams). We can use empathy to get closer to another person's experience; in other words we imagine ourselves in the same situation as he is in and credit him with the feelings we would then experience. However, it is invariably our own experience that we use as the yardstick. We judge another person's experience from his behaviour, of which speech is one of the most informative parts. If another person says, ‘I see a man’, and there is indeed a man in our shared visual field, then both of us assume we are sharing a common perceptual experience. When there is no external referent, as in the statement ‘I feel sad’, the assumption of a common experience rests on more tenuous grounds. We can sometimes look to an external situation, like the loss of a close relative, to confirm that we understand the statement in the same way. But on many occasions there is no readily understandable link between a person's mood and the situation in which he finds himself. In judging a person's mood we also depend a great deal on non-verbal accompaniments of emotional states, but these are known to vary from culture to culture and from individual to individual. The movements used to express emotion, particularly those of the face, are so complex that very few attempts have been made to describe and categorize them accurately. There is a paucity of studies of this kind between Charles Darwin's pioneering work of 1872, which attempted to show the similarity of emotional expression throughout the races of mankind, and the recent work of Ekman and Friesen (1968) and Grant (1970). The few systematic studies in the intervening century do not support an invariable pattern of expression accompanying specific emotions. However, Ekman et al. (1969) found that subjects from literate cultures accurately identified emotions from photographs of the face, although subjects from pre-literate cultures showed much less agreement.",

(PROVERBS 3, 4.) We live today in a world which has lost the ability to meditate. Such a generalization must exclude the individual souls who are trying to follow the advice of Proverbs, ‘keep him in thy thoughts wherever thou goest', and those who have entered religion. But taken by and large it is a fair commentary on the present situation, as can be seen from the following extract from a broadcast talk, given some years ago by Bertrand Russell: ‘As men grow more industrialized and regimented, the kind of delight which is common in children becomes impossible to adults, because they are always thinking of the ”next thing” and cannot let themselves be absorbed in the moment. This habit of “thinking of the next thing” is more fatal to any kind of aesthetic excellence than any other habit of mind that can be imagined, and if art, in any important sense, is to survive, it will not be by the foundation of solemn academies, but by recapturing the capacity for wholehearted joys and sorrows which prudence and foresight have all but destroyed.’",

Unfortunately, it is a word that is fashionable because of the countless cases of percussion and attacks that are being detected in schools and colleges, and are leading many students to live truly frightening situations.\r\nBullying refers to all forms of aggressive attitudes, intentional and repeated, that occur without evident motivation, adopted by one or more students against another or others. He that exercises bullying does to impose his power over the other through constant threats, insults, assaults, harassment, etc., and so it under their stranglehold over months and even years. The victim suffers silent in most cases. The intimidating abuse make you feel pain, distress, fear, to the point that, in some cases, can lead to devastating consequences such as suicide. Often, neither the parents nor the school will find out the situation of harassment, and when they do it is usually a pretty delicate situation, i.e. with serious consequences.\r\nBullying is an Anglo-Saxon term from the English word bully, bully or bully translated and coming to describe a whole, a variety of existing behaviors among our teenagers, ranging from:\r\n• Spending heavy jokes to other students\r\n• Let them empty or encourage other students to do so.\r\n• Put nicknames.\r\n• Hiding or throwing things to another partner.\r\n• Teasing for reasons such as a physical defect, skin color, not have a name common, grain appearance, voice change, difficulty speaking, wearing glasses, get good grades, be very high or very low, being overweight, etc.\r\n• Continuous provocations.\r\n• Raise false rumors about another partner.\r\n• Extortion fellow sacandoles money.

His own scars were deep, but his resilience was amply evident in his ability to not only to survive Auschwitz, but in his ability to write of his experience of it. There is general consensus that resilience is product of interactions of one's biology, psychology, and chance. Resilience lies in the nucleus of Darwin's \"the survival of the fittest\". The earliest medical notion of \"resilience\" was construed as the product of \"good\" rather than \"poor\" protoplasm, a pejorative but not completely wrong medical concept. Healing from the Holocaust has required active, vigorous, continuous, indeed life-long efforts, conscious ande unconscious. It has required efforts to cope with pain and loss of family, even uprooting from one's ongoing life and home; to mediate and sublimate one's omnipresent reactive rage.",

My doctrine is that every man ought to insure his life the moment he arrives at a period or position when his responsibility extends over the lives of others. If this duty were regarded as an imperative one by the community at large, there would be little or no necessity for the elaborate machinery required by our life offices to induce people to invest in life or other insurance policies; but as long as apathy prevails, such agencies must be maintained and a ceaseless activity displayed by the offices in tempting investors to enter into policy contracts.",

      "abstract": "In my work as a hospital chaplain I listen to many people whose daily life has been drastically interrupted by some kind of unexpected event—not always an illness— so that they have been obliged to stand back and try to take stock of all the things that have happened to them over the years. These people often say things which reveal the important part played by ritual in their lives, things like “I was married at St. So-and-So’s”, or “I remember being confirmed at St. Somewhere-else’s”. They may never have been to these churches again—most probably they have not in fact, or at least only rarely—but they remember what took place on these occasions, what it meant to them and how they felt about it. Now, when they look back, these things at least make sense. Sometimes, perhaps they are the only things that do make sense. All the meaning and purpose of a life has become attached to a particular occasion associated with a church service that they probably have not thought about for years. You could say that for them at this juncture in their lives the possibility of meaning only really exists at all because of that morning at St. So-and- So’s. You could also say that nowadays with some of our strong-minded theologically rigorous clergy they probably wouldn’t even have had that! Christian ritual has suffered attack from several directions, notably theology, psychopathology and anthropology. Protestant theologians in particular have regarded ritual as an idolatrous attempt on the part of men and women to reach God by means of human techniques and on human initiative.",

Humbleness allows people to honestly look deep into themselves, thus bringing them back into, or keeping them in, the moment. Humbleness is not just a trait of those who have fallen, it is a characteristic of the great, of those who are purpose-centered without ego. This chapter highlights that one aspect of humbleness in a person is simply finding the courage to accept that he/she has goofed up, fallen down, or completely blown up. Humbleness is the exact opposite of arrogance. People who are humble can constantly open themselves to learning new things and to being the best they can be. Being humble does not mean that one does not has pride, a healthy sense of esteem, or ego; it just means that a person is wise enough to see that he/she can never stop growing, learning, or accepting that he/she does not know it all.",

      "title": "Dying for a Cause: Meaning, Commitment, and Self-Sacrifice",
      "abstract": "Abstract Some people willingly risk or give up their lives for something they deeply believe in, for instance standing up to a dictator. A good example of this are members of the White Rose student resistance group, who rebelled against the Nazi regime and paid for it with their lives. I argue that when the cause is good, such risky activities (and even deaths themselves) can contribute to meaning in life in its different forms – meaning-as-mattering, meaning-as-purpose, and meaning-as-intelligibility. Such cases highlight the importance of integrity, or living up to one's commitments, in meaningful living, or dying, as it may be, as well as the risk involved in commitment, since if you die for a bad cause, you have only harmed yourself. However, if leading a more rather than less meaningful life benefits rather than harms you, there are possible scenarios in which you yourself are better off dying for a good cause than living a longer moderately happy life. This presents a version of a well-known puzzle: what, then, makes dying for a cause a self-sacrifice, as it usually seems to be? I sketch some possible answers, and critically examine relevant work in empirical psychology.",

But he can say nothing, it seems, about our experience of voluntariness from the inside. In the unhappy moment when we are reminded of a neglected obligation and admit our culpability for forgetting, what we say to ourselves is more like this: “I did it. I was the one who forgot. My tired brain, my habit of poor planning, my ridiculous passion for reading mystery novels, my grumpiness about this particular student: these things were involved in my forgetting. They are why I forgot, and because they are mine, the forgetting is also mine.” Barnwell does not want to talk about this experience: with admirable clarity and forthrightness, he admits that he is not looking for an account that includes character, emotion, or physical factors such as distraction, hunger, or physical fatigue. These things should have no effect on whether the action was voluntary. But how far can Barnwell progress without them? It sometimes seemed to me, as I was reading, that Barnwell had explained how negligent omissions could be voluntary without actually explaining their true character as voluntary human actions. JAMIE ANNE SPIERING Benedictine College Atchison, Kansas Personal Identity and Resurrection: How Do We Survive Our Death? Edited by GEORG GASSER. Farnham, Surrey; Burlington, Vt.: Ashgate, 2010. Pp. xv + 277. $99.95 (cloth). ISBN 978-1-4094-0493-4. This collection of fourteen articles is the fruit of a conference on the topic described by the book’s title, held at Innsbruck and Obergurgl, Austria, in 2008. The foreword by Ted Peters indicates the tome’s overall goal: not “to prove that the resurrection will occur” but to show that conceptual models of resurrection can “demonstrate coherence” (xiii). Gasser’s helpful introduction indicates that all the authors “are sympathetic toward the possibility of resurrection”; yet their starting points range from “materialist to dualist conceptions of the human person,” while their methods include “classical theological approaches, recent analytic metaphysics, and various ideas from continental philosophy” (2). The introduction also includes a summary of each contribution (14-17). A bibliography (259-72) lists all works cited in the articles; a combined name and subject index (273-77) is most welcome. Of the fourteen contributors, twelve are professors of philosophy, while two (Nikolaus Wandinger and Robert John Russell) are theology professors. Six hold positions in the United States, four in Germany, three in Austria, and one in BOOK REVIEWS 662 England. The scholars assembled often cite the work of the other contributors, even citing other articles in the book itself, comparing the others’ conclusions with their own. These comparisons help to unify the volume, making it easier for readers to judge for themselves the relative merits of the proposals offered. Most of the articles lay more emphasis on synchronic analysis and speculation than on the diachronic or the historical genesis of ideas. Assumptions for the sake of argument are often made, requiring the reader to consider various thoughtexperiments that are necessarily of interest only for understanding the author’s intent. As may be expected when new conceptual territory is being explored, terminology is sometimes adopted and defined on the fly. Thankfully (for this reviewer, at least), there are no mazes of symbolic logic to negotiate. There is some attention paid to historical positions and to secondary literature on those positions,although this is sometimes more cursory than one would prefer. Recent work is more often referenced; in particular, a 1978 article by Peter van Inwagen (“The Possibility of Resurrection,” International Journal for Philosophy of Religion) is a point of reference for many of the articles. In addressing the question in the book’s title (“How do we survive our death?”), nearly all of the contributions accept the widespread view that the answer given by the traditional soul/body anthropology (where the individual soul survives death and is reunited with the body at the resurrection) is no longer tenable. They offer new proposals for explaining how humans can be said to exist through the gap between death and resurrection (or...",

Throughout his life and his work, Derrida always called our attention to the innumerable possibilities of defacement, as well as to the limits of memory figured in \"testamentary signs, traces, hypograms, hypomnemata, signatures and epigraphs, or autobiographical 'memoirs'\" (Memoires, 29). One wonders, on occasions like these, an occasion that is already over-determined, discursively (and otherwise), if it would be better to remain silent; to keep the act of memory secret or private, perhaps even intimate; not to risk betraying the other who is \"in me\" or \"between us\" to the spectacle of a loud display; to hold in confidence and completely away from the \"public\" the moments (however brief and, no doubt, inconsequential) I may have shared with one who is now departed and who only exists as a shadow, a shadow of a shadow, whose presence has been consigned to memory, forgetfulness, and de-facement. And yet, on occasions like these, we know that Derrida himself never chose to remain silent, or refused the strange imperative to speak publicly \"in the memory of...\"—of course, not without a series of endless qualifications that quickly became a hallmark of his manner (or style) of speaking on these occasions. Derrida's own performative acts of memory—and there were many, particularly in recent years when friends, colleagues, and former mentors passed away—have already attested to the impossibility, the \"double-bind,\" the extreme risk of speaking \"in the memory of.\" I always had the suspicion that on these occasions, in addition to assuming a responsibility for the other, he was also preparing us for precisely this moment when we would be compelled to speak in \"the memory of J.D.\" (As he said, \"Funerary speech and writing do not follow upon death; they work upon life in what we call autobiography\" [Memoires, 22]) Perhaps, anticipating his death and the incredible work of mourning that would immediately ensue, as well as the inevitable acts of de-facement that were all too familiar to him when he was alive, Derrida was already forewarning us concerning the pitfalls and the incredible seductions that such an act of [End Page 53] memory bears in its performative sense—the spectacles of proximity and the claims of authentic mourning (vs. the inauthentic, the insincere, or the self-interested), the institution of new hierarchies or the consolidation of old alliances \"in his name,\" and, of course, the frenetic production of new \"testamentary signs, traces, hypograms, hypomnemata, signatures and epigraphs, or autobiographical 'memoirs.'\" I would not be alone in observing that \"our profession\"—and Derrida frequently spoke about the archaic religious determination of our community—lives off occasions like these, and in these moments we \"gather together\" to engage in signs, rituals, and speeches that are purely formal in some sense. This is our Mass, our Eucharist, or rather, our Tea Ceremony, which does not mean that as a performative event its meaning is completely inauthentic. Not completely. However, as a community founded upon an extremely conflicted and even tortuous relation to the \"natural\" (if not brutal) fact of the animality that afflicts each of its individual members—who are fundamentally alone, whether this solitude is experienced in the silence of writing, in sexuality, or in the death of an other—these rituals always bear within them the implicit danger of becoming pure acts of \"snobbery.\"1 It is already a remarkable, but equally, a strange habit that when an animal dies the human is compelled, if not obligated, to transform this simple biological fact into speech (logos). Stranger still are the acts of memory that metamorphose the animal into a ghost resurrected from the dead animal's body in order to respond to the living community's solicitation \"to come\"; who can thereafter be invoked (either through séance or through citation) to speak as if \"in his own name.\" I would like to think that this a pure accident of language, a symptom or lapsus, even the miraculous property only made possible...",

Our bodies serve us as we direct and when they break down we become angry that they have failed us. Christians, however, are called to be a patient people even in illness. Indeed, impatience is a sin. Learning to be patient when sick requires practicing patience while healthy. First, we must learn that our bodies are finite — they will die. Second, we must learn to live with one another in patience as Christians with the love that the presence of others can and does create in us. Third, in life there is time for the acquisition of habits that come from worthy activities that require time and force us to take first one step and then another. In patience one can live with God.",

The result is partly a kind of autobiography: The hooks that get to me deeply are keys to my soul (a significant use of an elusive term). Hooks delight me and encourage me like good friends, and evoke reverence when higher powers seem to sponsor them. They serve as vehicles for my projection of pieces of ideal personal life in which I am strong, mobile, and sensitive and I join forces with other minds-voices-bodies in a vibrant social order. Objectivity in hook discernment isn't guaranteed, but I can testify that many hooks have not submitted to my projection passively; they have enlarged my horizons and enabled me to make needed adjustments, again like good friends. In my own hook experience I clearly show a bias toward the dramatic, the charged moment, the immediate difference-making, while others may find greater aesthetic reward via their sense of sustained quality or gradual evolution or large summations (that War and Peace feeling). Yet any kind of aesthetic experience might be accessible to any of us.",

My advice to aspiring professionals would be for them to put themselves to the test as often as possible. Do not wait until you are completely ready to undertake the goals of ambition. There is no such thing as being completely ready. No artist can stop growing— not until he dies. Competitions are a case in point. The important part of a contest, outside of the eventual prize, is self-improvement. It is the reward of the also-ran. Trial and failure demand as much as trial and success. Competitions help you learn more about yourself than anything else.",

He cautions, however, that although dialogue impedes violence, it should not be pursued unilaterally or vigorously, because this can also lead to violence. The abolition of violence, which is the goal at which dialogue aims, can instead turn violent in the face of unrestrained persuasive discourse. Vigilance and caution must be maintained if dialogue is not to lapse into hostility and aggression. It is important to respect differences and acknowledge insoluble problems in order to avoid animosity. Without recognition and respect, dialogue can become adversarial and antagonistic.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest gifts people can enjoy and share with others is a sense of one’s own inner peace, but people can’t share what they don’t have. This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.",

Not only spend people a substantial portion of their life at work but some of them also enjoy working and are enthusiastic about it. Love for work can be fascinating and liberating or oppressive and compelling. Love for work may develop into an addiction but it can provide enormous satisfaction as well.

The things we do to make ourselves happy are merely the tip of the iceberg. Sam Wren-Lewis offers an alternative process that acknowledges insecurity and embraces uncertainty.

This book is not really about how to manage all that waiting—“an action,” according to the OED, “of staying where one is until a particular time or event.” It’s a book describing how many people experience waiting. Waiting, which is sculpted by the passing of time, is an experience just as much as it is a situation. In this book I’ll be focusing on the experience, on how it feels to wait. This experience can encompass such things as hesitation and curiosity, dithering and procrastination, hunting and being hunted, fearing and being feared, dread and illness, courting and parenting, anticipation and excitement, listening to and even performing music, being religious, being happy or unhappy, being bored and being boring, doing business and making decisions (all of which I’ll discuss). Waiting is also characterized by such brain chemicals as serotonin and dopamine. They enable the experience of waiting and they can even change the way that waiting’s basis, the passing of time, is registered. Waiting, probably the most commonly experienced situation that humans and animals encounter apart from sleep, is the experience that may characterize most interpersonal relations.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Following Assault",
      "abstract": "Abstract A trauma is an extremely painful emotional experience that poses threat of injury or death and makes the person feel terrified and helpless. Thus, trauma includes both objective aspects of threat and subjective aspects of extreme negative emotions. Accordingly, a car accident may or may not be traumatic. If it severely disrupts the person’s life and causes substantial emotional distress, we call it a trauma. If it causes some transitory fear and does not leave much of a mark on the person, we wouldn’t call it a trauma. Therefore, a trauma is in part defined by what is traumatic for you. Also, a traumatic experience does not necessarily mean that you yourself have been threatened. One can become traumatized by witnessing someone else being killed or injured, or even by hearing about a disaster that happened to significant others. For example, witnessing someone burning in a fire is traumatic as is the visit of army representatives to notify a mother that her son was killed in the war.",

      "abstract": "Society gifts a person with myriad of identities, in different places a person has to put up different attire. He has to juggle with the multiplicity of pretentiousness where he loses his uniqueness. Everything changes when the attire is ripped, damaged, torn, ragged and finally converted to rugs. A man then starts feeling miserable to see the original him. At certain spaces he feels rejected and tries to get alienated, which results in his isolation that makes him believe that he is standing without identity. In the novel, Winter in the Blood, we meet a thirty- two year old narrator who is nameless and is disheartened facing the societal challenges, who is rejected, isolated and segregated and has no corner to breathe a colorful life with shimmering sound. He thus, chooses a deep dark nook to breathe Nihilism. The narrator is so much normal to the entire non normal situations that now he feels nothing for any situation or person. We can see his losses, his pain, and his struggle for survival when we catch all twenty-two situations where he can adjure neither his love nor his fear. A sense of helplessness and the fear of being stalked by the shadow of white-men traumatize him and drag him towards alienation and isolation. The present paper aims at analyzing the crisis of self identity in the novel, Winter in the Blood.&#x0D;",

Many of the images searing through the pages of the present volume similarly burn. They burn with motifs of aging, of a slow decline in a person's life or a sudden disaster, illness, injury, loss, death. They are burning with concerns about frailty, weakness, impairment; with fears of debility or dementia—and intimations of dementia, sudden, stark ghosts of absent self and memory. They burn with concerns of increased dependency on others, and of complex weaves of interdependency, including within the “dementia socialities” found within dementia wards in northern Europe. The images burn with the span of generations and inheritance and the emergences of time. They burn with the appearance of ontological breakdown and the scary possibility of breakdown and rupture in any given life. They burn with the fragility of bodies and selves, as well as the continued strength and vitality and potential in a life, even if that vitality and potential come to be largely imaginative in nature.",

      "title": "Stranger at the Door",
      "abstract": "At the beginning of a new writing project—whether it’s the first page of a new novel or a less ambitious project, writers often experience exhilaration, fear, or dread. For Kristjana Gunnars, the call of a new project is “like someone you don’t know knocking on your door—you either choose to let the person in or not. It’s both exciting and dangerous to start a new manuscript.” This book is an engagement with that “stranger” called writing. Creative or imaginative writing is a complex process that involves more than intellect alone. Writers make use of everything: their sensibilities, history, culture, knowledge, experience, education, and even their biology. These essays seek out, and gather into a discussion, what writers have said about their own experiences in writing. Although the writers are from around the world and of very different backgrounds, the commonality of their remarks brings home the realization that writers everywhere are grappling with similar problems—with the seemingly simple problems of when, where, why, and what to write, but also larger questions such as the relationship between writer and society, or issues of privacy, appropriation, or homelessness. While none of these questions can be definitively answered, they can be fruitfully discussed. Originating as questions posed in creative-writing seminars, these essays have grown into companion texts for both writers and readers who want to participate in a conversation about what writers do.",

      "abstract": "are how we speak to one another in print caroming thoughts not merely in order to convey a certain packet of information, but with a special edge or bounce of personal character in a kind of public letter. You multiply yourself as a writer, gaining height as though jumping on a trampoline, if you can catch the gist of what other people have also been feeling and clarify it for them. Classic essay subjects, like the flux of friendship, On Greed, On Religion, On Vanity, or solitude, lying, self-sacrifice, can be major-league yet not require Bertrand Russell to handle them. A layman who has diligently looked into something, walking in the mosses of regret after the death of a parent, for instance, may acquire an intangible authority, even without being memorably angry or funny or possessing a beguiling equanimity. #c cares; therefore, if he has tinkered enough with his words, we do too. An essay is not a scientific document. It can be serendipitous or domestic, satire or testimony, tongue-in-cheek or a wail of grief. Mulched perhaps in its own contradictions, it promises no sure objectivity, just the condiment of opinion on a base of observation, and sometimes such leaps of illogic or superlogic that they may work a bit like magic realism in a novel: namely, to simulate the mind's own processes in a murky and incongruous world. More than being instructive, as a magazine article is, an essay has a slant, a seasoned personality behind it that ought to",

The story highlights Tom’s unique practice of inviting partners to become intimate witnesses to one another’s experience as a means for accountability in relationships. “I(Tom) might be asking some questions that are a bit unusual or at least different than what you might think. For example, Dan, rather than asking you what living with these struggles has been like for you personally, I am going to ask you to be a witness to what you think it’s been like for Megan to live with the feelings of resentment that you’ve been having towards her, the distance, the coldness…. Do you have any guesses as to what it’s been like for Megan, as a person, to be living with this resentment and coldness over the past several months?” Dan and Megan are reunited in their understanding and appreciation of one another.",

Micro- and macro-presentations of white supremacy, othering and socio-political phobias are direct results of the insecurities and laziness of colonialists and their contemporary progeny, neocolonialists. Whichever way it shows up (and it does relentlessly, surviving on something more than oxygen), this so-called supremacy and those committed to working on its behalf inherently resist freedom. Conversely, autonomy is inevitable when we take for ourselves the chief components of what is necessary for any deep-rooted infrastructure, personal or otherwise: space and time. Taking space and time to learn, strategize, explore and create—individually and cooperatively—are essential to persevere and overturn an intangible, inescapable ideology meant to snuff out our very life force.",

Trauma, especially early childhood trauma, would cause this and even if we do not consciously know the trauma the mnemic memory trace of it would be enough to cause a disturbance in our default mechanisms. The result is that we would exist in a hypervigilant state, always waiting for the next traumatic event and, as per Freud’s pleasure/pain principle, that pressure will build to an unsustainable level meaning we will either explode and act out on/with others or implode and act in on ourselves.

Those people who are left too afraid of their own anger to do other than defend against it may remain crippled by the trauma for a considerable time. It is important and indeed necessary for the traumatised adult to be aware of his or her own aggression, since this helps to re-establish a realistic perception of the dangers of the world following a traumatic experience. This chapter explores the nature of grievance, as it arises in victims of trauma. For other people litigation is more clearly a part of maintaining rather than relinquishing a feeling of grievance, and a way of remaining stuck with the identity of 'victim' rather than moving on from it. Distinctively, grievance involves a feeling of being the victim of an injustice.",

      "abstract": "INCE my college days began, in S the fall of i900, no world has L seemed so real, so vivid, so challenging as the world of education, and it is unlikely that any other ever can or will. As long as the spirit quickens within me, I hope it may remain my home. In moments of retrospect, I can think of no other career I might have attempted that could have yielded more rewarding experiences or more durable satisfactions. It is not likely that any other career path would have led to more favorable formative influences than those I found, following Denison, at Wisconsin, Massachusetts Institute, the Bell Telephone System, or the joint project in which I served the engineering colleges and the Carnegie Corporation. Nor would any other path have set my home in more stimulating places than Rochester, Madison, Boston, Montclair, and Cleveland, or have led to wider travel over North America and Western Europe, or have created so wide and altogether choice a circle of personal associations, or have made such wide demands on versatility, or have invoked a higher degree of self-expression, or have offered such rewarding opportunities for civic service and spiritual fellowship. I even doubt if in any other career I would have made any more money, or have enjoyed more creature comforts, or have been able to give my children better advantages. Well, if it is such a satisfying life, with so much privilege and so little sacrifice, why should any one ever wish to retire ? My favorite New Testament text, on which I have written and spoken more than any other, is the familiar counsel of perfection, If any man compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain. Frankly, I do not want to miss that second mile. For most of us, life begins in a mile of compulsion, a round of tasks and duties which must be traversed daily if one is to survive, but beyond that lies the mile of voluntary endeavor where men strive for understanding rather than power, for excellence rather than quantity, for self-expression rather than gain. Here men literally work for fun, and I have a firm conviction that men ought to complete their careers in the second mile, rather than the first. As long as life remains an adventure, men live in the future rather than the past. The late war, the greatest adventure of all, made crystalgazers of every one of us.

      "abstract": "“I know now that I haven't resolved my inner conflicts. I have to come to terms with the emotional violence I've suffered and learn to do what I want to do.” The “I” is always italicised in the inflection. “My counsellor says that I am far too generous and must learn to live life on my terms.”\r\n\r\nWhy is it that we feel such profound fatigue when faced with the regurgitated views of the counsellor? It is not because the statements are necessarily wrong or invalid, merely that, repeated so frequently to hordes of moderately dissatisfied people, they seem to become almost totally devoid of meaning. It is as though the counsellor has dipped his or her hand into the cookie jar of aphorisms labelled “dissatisfied housewife” and come out with a series of brightly coloured platitudes.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that once we have subscribed to a particular, usually simplified version of reality, it is often impossible to experience the world without those blinkered preconceptions. I am reminded of something that John Mortimer wrote in his autobiographical Clinging to the wreckage. As the curtain fell on the opening night of his play about his father, he realised that he had lost something. In the process of creating lines for the stage character he found that he could no longer remember what his father had actually said, and what he had created for him. Something is always lost in the process of articulation. In talking about ourselves, we risk creating fiction.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that talking about yourself, in any way, with anyone, is actually rather hazardous, and that perhaps we do too much of it now. My parents came from a generation to whom discussion of their feelings was something for which they had almost no vocabulary. But perhaps because they couldn't articulate their feelings they also did not degrade them. They did not pulverise their emotions in order to fit them into the same shaped boxes as some celebrity in Hello magazine.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that the words we use to describe the world ultimately constrain the way we feel about it and the way we see it. Before embarking on a voyage of self discovery, or helping another on the same path, I would be mindful of Einstein's aphorism: “You should strive to make things as simple as possible, but no simpler.”",

      "abstract": "We don't just 'return to work' once after leave – we return every day, week, term and academic year as changes and new pressures mean a readjustment of our schedules and expectations. This chapter examines some of the difficulties of the immediate return to work, such as the financial pressures, the shock to the system of juggling nursery drop-offs alongside the commute, and changes in our own sense of identity. These can all make our return more complex both practically and emotionally. We also explore the ways to ease the pressures including alternative flexible working patterns, good practice around breastfeeding and the immense importance of regular clear communication from both sides. And finally, there's the positives over the longer-term return: the rediscovery of our teaching identities, the reinvigoration of passion and ambition that can come with the time away and the power of discovering the harmony of being both parent and teacher.",

      "abstract": "‘Why does Hamlet delay?’ The question has been asked for over two hundred years now. And whether or not it is the best way to interrogate the play, it seems now a natural one. For after every new reading or performance, it’s difficult to avoid that prickling, sympathetic and exasperated sensation which formulates itself as: ‘Why does Hamlet delay?’ Whatever more correct form the enquiry takes, something to do with time does seem to be at the centre of Hamlet: which – to the extent that the play tells this kind of truth at all – makes the whole of life a great waiting game. The prince himself, who doesn’t know everything, and whose knowledge is above all that he doesn’t know everything, chooses to call what is happening to him, delay; and chooses to find himself guilty of it; or finds himself guilty, whether or not he chooses; and in all these ways, may be right. The qualifications are made necessary by everything in Hamlet that makes the simple and direct ‘Why does Hamlet delay?’ not the best of questions, though a natural one. All questions are leading, and condition the object of enquiry in the direction of what we want to know about it. To ask this particular one is to push Hamlet towards presuppositions about life and literature which are in themselves doubtful, and which almost certainly didn’t come into being until the period at which the question about Hamlet began to be asked about: the middle of the eighteenth century.",

But then there is pain in remembering pleasure lost. Is repentance good or bad? Is hope good, or should we pin no hopes on the future? Does anticipating misfortune fortify or depress? Is planning for the future needed for self-identity? Should we ignore both past and future, or abstract from time altogether? Does prolongation or delay make a difference, or an endless recurrence of history, or discontinuous, or dispersible, or everlasting selves? Can we create a persona through memory, or through choices?

For example, apparently she has spaghetti about me pinning her down as a child and tickling her until she screamed for mercy. She knows this because when her spouse tried to do the same, the experience she had as a child came flooding back as a complex tangle of fears, feelings, and mental images. Notwithstanding the trauma inflicted on a sibling in my youth, the spaghetti metaphor is a simple but useful tool for explaining how complex our experiences are, and I bring it up here because I believe a lot of people have spaghetti about love. So much so, that often love becomes distorted, sometimes to the point of making one completely blind to manipulation and abuse. Part of the blame for 'love spaghetti' can be allotted to media depictions of romance and gender, which helps entrench and maintain our deeply held beliefs about what relationships should look like.",

      "title": "Happiness and Life Satisfaction: A Correlational Study",
      "abstract": "Happiness is a mental state of well-being characterized by positive emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. Happiness is a goal that people commonly strive for. Sometimes it seems as though formany, it is out ofreach. Strong marriages, family ties, friendships, spirituality, and self-esteem all help to determine happiness (Morris, 20001). People need to find goals for themselves that reflect their interests and values. When the goals are achieved, the person's wellbeing is lifted. People need to find the things that make themselves Laughter is always a key issue of happiness. People need to smile and laugh more and more throughout their lives. Getting rid of all of the bad things and replacing those with good things will always help in the destination to happiness (Morris, 2001 ). Happiness is not merely a life lived by accumulating moments of pleasure. On the contrary, happiness is a long lasting enduring enjoyment of life; it is being in love with living. It is your reward for achieving a good character and personal rational values in life. Some important values are a productive career, romance, friendship and hobbies. Real happiness is a matter of experience, not of speech, not of demonstration. It can be had only by being introvert, cutting ourselves from all the non-self entities and being one with our soul itself. Since the soul is full of happiness, experience of the soul is the experience of happiness. Just as one cannot achieve the soul without experience, in the same manner one cannot get real happiness without the experience of the soul.Traits of Happy PeopleThere are some different traits seem to characterize happy people.* High self-esteem: These people believe themselves to be more ethical, more intelligent, less prejudiced, better able to get along with others, and healthier.* Personal control: People with an internal locus of control, usually achieve more in school, cope better with stress, and live more happily.* Optimistic: These people believe that with enough faith, can do almost anything. Being a pessimist only makes people more vulnerable to illness (Myers, 1992).* Extroverted: Social, outgoing people report greater happiness and satisfaction with life. (Myers, 1997c).* Health: In studies people frequently cite health as an important contributor to happiness - and for some reason. While we may be able to adapt too many things that happen to us physically, but they take an emotional toll. When it comes to chronic pain and mental illness adaptation is more difficult and there should be a priority placed upon controlling suffering (Layard 2005).* Work: There is considerable evidence that we need to feel we are contributing to the wider society. Layard comments, Work provides not only income but also an extra meaning to life'.If a person isn't happy, how do they become happy? It is easy to say that happiness comes with having positive self-esteem, feeling control over our own lives, and being optimistic, but how do we achieve these if we don't already have them? Some scientists believe that happiness can be learned. practice it day in and day out can achieve it. Increasing your happiness may not always be easy. A person may be working against their own innate personality traits, learned thinking habits, and the environment. If want to keep your happiness at the higher end of the set range, you have to commit yourself every day to doing things to make happy. (Morris, 2001).Robert E. Lane's influential study (2000) showed strong links between subjective feelings of well-being and companionship (by which Lane meant family solidarity and friendship). We gain happiness through our relationships with other people. He aigued, 'it is their affection or dislike, their good or bad opinion of us, their acceptance or rejection that most influences our moods. To all this we can add what we know of the significance of relationship in the early years of human life particularly in the home. …",

      "abstract": "The roots of advertisement are connected with reclamations, claims and arguments. No surprise that many people treat it with distrust, suspicion and irritation. Nobody loves advertisement (except its authors and those who order it), nobody watches it, everybody despises it and get annoyed because of it. But newspapers, magazines, television and city economy in general cannot do without it. One keeps on arguing whether to prohibit advertisement, to restrict its expansion, to bring in stricter regulations on advertisement… If something attracts attention, intrigues, promises to make dreams true and arouses desire to join - it should be considered as advertisement. This definition allows saying with no doubts: yes, advertisement did existed in the most ancient strongest cultures. Advertisement is as old as the humane civilization. There have always been the objects to be advertised, and different methods appeared to reach those goals. Advertisement techniques and topics appear, get forgotten and appear again in other places and other times. Sometimes the author of advertisement image has no idea about his forerunners and believes he is the discoverer. A skillful designer with high level of professionalism deliberately uses images from past centuries. The professional is easily guided by historical prototypes. But there is another type of advertisement, its prototypes cannot be found in museums. It does not suppose any respect, because it is built on scornful attitude towards the spectator. However, basically the advertisement is made by professional designers, and in this case ignorance is inadmissible. Even if we many times appeal to Irkutsk designers to work on raising their cultural level of advertisements, anyhow, orders will be always made by those who pay. Unless Its Majesty Ruble stands for Culture, those appeals are of no use.",

The average duration of unemployment tripled for individuals over the age of 55, rising faster than the unemployment duration of younger adults. The workplace has changed dramatically over the last decade and consequently the job-seeking process and skills required has changed. The qualitative Research reveals to what extend the participants associate their personal identity with their profession and the impact unemployment had on the person’s identity. Unemployment can become a life transition, when a person can’t find a job doing the same work they’ve always done. Many not only rethink one thing but everything. Hope reawakens in us. “We come to realize the dream we dreamed has never died. We decide to resume our search …. For the life we know within our heart that we were meant to live.”",

Someone has said that if we progress, we have advantages, and if we do not progress, just stop where we are, we lose. If we regress, we are chrushed. In this thesis, the writer writes about a child's maturition. His name is Jody and he has become mature through experiences. Jody is the main character in John Steinbeck's The Red Pony. The thesis writer would like to show that Jody learns that life is not always as we wish. In the process of learning difficult lessons Jody matures. He shows the fruit of maturity such as compassion, empathy and also caring for other people. Jody's development can not be separated from other characters and the influence they have on him. He learns character and valuable lessons from the people who surround him. All of these factors prepare Jody to face the harsh reality which he faces. It is interesting to know that some one can accept reality and produce the mature fruits of life from it such as caring, empathy and love.",

      "abstract": "This chapter draws together reflexivity, mindfulness, and autoethnography to examine the conditions surrounding my dad's addiction and death as related to the prospect of writing my story. I begin by defining reflexivity and mindfulness, existential practices I take to be interrelated in instructive ways. I then convey four meditations that explore the conditions that keep me from writing a fuller and even more evocative account: the extraordinary nature of my story, the risks to revisiting trauma, the alternate space for resonance and reflection in mediated texts, and exhaustion. I describe these influences in the form of reflexive \"maybes\" to stress and underscore the contingent and thus tentative nature of this labor. In distinct and shared ways, each of these conditions comprises my phenomenological lifeworld (everyday reality); in turn, each shapes the ways in which I do, or do not, write. I conclude by reflecting on several lessons that stem from using mindfulness and reflexivity to evocatively uncover the influences that inform the story I cannot write.",

As the extreme lassitude and weakness left by the fever and the pain wore off, the irritations took over. I yearned to change my position, to move ever so slightly onto a cooler spot on the sheet, and I couldn't. My heels itched and I couldn't even move them up and down on the bed.

In rebellion there can be a perverse but profound joy. But whatever the matter may be for gods, unlike Sisyphus, we do not roll the rock forever. Our choices are in the face of death and with those with whom we share no ultimate convictions. Contemporary thought is marked by a growing distance from ultimate orientation and purpose. Blind to final purposes, we tum to ourselves for meaning. As moral strangers, within the fabric of secular morality, we confront godlike choices with impoverished human vision, and without ultimate guideposts.",

      "abstract": "Authenticity is being real and true to oneself and outwardly expressing that truth. Authenticity is not a leadership style, but rather a practice that will empower you and others each time you choose to reveal it. It is also not about bearing your soul or sharing every intimate part of yourself to those you lead. Rather, it is consistently demonstrating your concerns, enthusiasm, strengths, weaknesses, learning, and vision.Choosing to be authentic as a leader will reward you with a deeper connection with those you lead and foster courage in them. Discovering your authenticity can be painful and sometimes awkward, but even those moments of pain and discomfort can be powerful model of healthy vulnerability for others. Authenticity and vulnerability are not generally rewarded and are often challenged in our society. Therefore, it is easy to slide back into staying hidden and stoic. True authenticity then is a daily, sometimes moment by moment, choice.This chapter describes an experience of finding authentic expression as a leader and how challenges will test that authenticity. Values, vulnerability, and vision are described and presented as anchors for choosing authenticity as a daily practice.",

      "title": "Stay Mad: A Love Letter to QTBIPOC Psychiatric Survivors",
      "abstract": "My Comrades,I do not know the context or conditions that led to your survival, institutionalization, incarceration, or isolation from our people. I do not know your story, pain, or struggle. I do not know who has harmed you or who you have harmed—because yes, we have all caused harm, though most of us, myself included, are good at burying this fundamental truth. I extend my love and care for all you have endured and all you are holding. For every name you have been called, every hostile hand laid upon you, every lie you swallowed with your morning pills or prayers. For every time you were gaslighted. For every shame spiral. For every person who has ever made you feel small, ugly, afraid, disposable, or weak through their ignorance, shame, fear, and hurt—I extend love and the reminder that you are never to blame for the hatred and violence you experience.You deserve so much more than this. We deserve so much more than this.I am writing you this letter in the spirit of camaraderie and care and as someone who knows what it feels like to be desperately lonely, broken, afraid, and completely mad.2 Coming up in the Midwest as a neurodivergent mixed queer Asian in the 1980s and 1990s, I did not have access to many stories or people in my life that reflected all the parts of me for comfort, inspiration, and support. I spent a lot of time searching across histories, zines, movements, gay bars, theory, politics, books, and music for my reflections. I found them everywhere I went. We all deserve to feel seen, witnessed, and reflected in this world. I hope my sharing makes you feel a little safer speaking your truth and reflecting on some of the stories you tell yourself about your madness, identities, or worthiness with some tenderness and compassion. I hope my sharing reminds you that you are never alone in this struggle. All our stories come together through history. When we weave them together, we create the foundation to understand ourselves, each other, and the systems and institutions we are navigating.As someone who has had many jobs over the years, I have had the chance to work in many industries, from food service to running organizing campaigns to research to childcare to selling dildos. I can safely say that I have learned that a job is not absolute stability; it is just the illusion of stability. We have all held on white-knuckled as we watched markets rise and fall, bubbles bursting, crashes, and corporate looting at our expense. We have watched as the bills keep growing and the checks that we get stay the same size or get smaller or disappear altogether. The American pie is enormous, and somehow the slices have gotten quite a bit smaller and a lot more expensive for most of us. As one elder described it to me once, “While we are all fighting for this one piece of pie, white men are sitting at an all-you-can-eat buffet and enjoying the entertainment.”I am not an expert, professional, or academic. On paper, I am a failure by the standards set out for us under capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy. (As I type this, my safety teams’ voices are ringing in my head, saying, “You are not a failure! Do not minimize your work!”) I am a failure because I do not meet the bar for being considered a person under capitalism. I am not employed full-time. I do not have access to intergenerational wealth. I am not married with children. I am not an influencer on social media. I do not have a lot of disposable income. I do not own land. These are the standards by which success, value, and worthiness are measured in a neoliberal and capitalist society.I am even more of a failure because I am too tired, achy, and angry to continue pretending to care about climbing my way out of the crab barrel up the socioeconomic ladder. This mad queer fatigue from surviving a global pandemic while watching white male mediocracy explode into full-blown insurrection has put a bit of a damper on that American Dream. I'm sure many of us know the pressure of living up to the expectations of an immigrant parent who wants so much more for us. I was conflicted by the pressure to get money, titles, and positions of power in institutions. Somehow, that was supposed to be the stability I needed to keep me safe from these feelings, memories, and hate. Somehow, capitalist realism had me internalizing the belief that the walls I kept throwing myself up against and burning myself out on were my own fault and problem.This failure, at times, has been devastating, overwhelming, and terrifying. It is also certainly not new or unique to me. I came to the movement to figure out how to build safety and care and change our conditions. When I cannot figure out how to access this, it is very maddening. When I learned the truth—that capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy were failing all of us and not the other way around—through study, practice, and building and learning with and from other people, it confirmed that what I had taken for personal failure was systemic and designed to maintain a hierarchy of power.As the pandemic drags on, like many of us, I have had to hold the grief of losing my comrades too soon and honor that I rarely let myself grieve fully, if at all. Our mad and disabled elders and ancestors have offered strategies, tools, and analysis to guide us in a world where it is impossible to feel at home because of the oppression we face. How do we make a home in this imperfect, achy, broken-hearted, and tired body? How do we become our sanctuaries and safe space? How do we build homes that have room for the messiness of surviving and of failing?I am leaning into a more accessible and aligned ambition—to accept that my mind and body function on my own time and in my way, and that is not bad, wrong, or a fault. My survival and madness should not mean I will have to spend the rest of my life in poverty while being surveilled and policed by institutions that answer to the owning class. I should not have to hide any parts of myself or perform or produce in ways that don't work for my needs and capacity. My value cannot be measured by how much curriculum I write, how many sandwiches I make, or how many toilets I clean. None of us should have to destroy ourselves to survive. James Baldwin's question in The Fire Next Time feels like the appropriate one at yet another moment of systemic failure: “Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?”3 He raised a question nearly sixty years ago that many of us, our communities, and movements are still struggling to figure out.Our oppression is unbearable. It is intergenerational. It is also collective. It has been almost two decades since my liberation from psych wards. From forced medicating, special education, restraint, abuse, group therapy, and day treatment programs that stole my childhood and youth from me, separated me from my family and community, and cost my dignity and sense of humanity. I still wander lost and lonely through the hallways, common rooms, and isolation rooms of those hospitals and day treatment programs in my nightmares and flashbacks. I spent my childhood and youth believing and accepting what my peers and adults—my family, doctors, nurses, social workers, program directors, and teachers—told me: that I was a dangerous burden. They taught me that because I was under sixteen, I did not know what my body, mind, and spirit needed: I was broken, ugly, and disgusting because I was born into a mixed-race, queer, and trans body with a neurodivergent mind. They taught me that my resistance to their drugs and treatment were signs of my incompetence and misunderstanding of how medicine works, despite my frequent and noticeable debilitating side effects. That my feelings, lived experience, and survival were not real and did not matter. That I was inherently and always would be less of a human being. All of that justified the cruel ways they decided to “fix” me, or at the very least, shut me up and keep me in my place.If my truth resonates with you or reflects your feelings and experiences, I want to thank you for existing and surviving. I also want to offer the first wellness goal in my safety plan with my support team as a reminder that you are so much more than a paycheck, job title, or diagnosis. “Remembering that capitalism is the true perpetual crisis, I give myself permission to let go of the ableist notions of worthiness, productivity, and value—instead, centering and prioritizing my wholeness in the service of myself and my people.” I worry about how my madness shows up and feel guilty for not working the same way others can. I have struggled to unlearn the sanist and ableist lies I internalized about myself and others.When I do not honor my body, madness, and capacity, I have learned that I often end up causing harm, being unaccountable, and feeling trapped in my trigger responses and spirals. When I prioritize capitalism, professionalism, performance, and perfectionism over my relationships, well-being, principles, and care networks that keep me alive, I almost always succumb to my mad spirals.If I recognize that the real crises are capitalism and the systemic oppression that keeps its lifeblood flowing, it allows me to be with my madness differently. It allows me to understand what I experienced as a kid from a lens that connects me to every other kid and survivor who has been isolated for our differences. It allows me to understand how the twisted roots of white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, patriarchy, and anti-Blackness have shaped my own lived experiences, my patterns of harm, and the practices of resilience and transformation that guide me.You are not a burden or a crisis. You are not failing; capitalists built the system to fail us. You carry the shame and guilt of generations, shame and guilt that should have never been placed upon you. Your measures of success, thriving, or healing can only ever be determined by you because there is no other you in the world. They may have tried to strip us of our humanity, but we know they failed because we can still feel. After all, drugs and therapies can manage the madness and support our well-being. Still, I believe madness will transform when we unite to share our truth and organize ourselves and our communities towards liberation.Transformative justice4 and disability justice5 are the practices, wisdom, and processes that generations of Black, Indigenous, Immigrant, People of Color, queer and trans, disabled, mad and neurodivergent, poor and working-class people have been building, brick by brick, over the centuries globally. They are the fruits of the labor and sacrifice of people trying to survive, trying to hold on to what little they could as their languages, lands, and lives were stripped away from them in the service of industry, progress, greed, and empire.They also left us, most importantly, the knowing and feeling that we can and that we must change the world.Your struggle, suffering, and heartache are real. The isolation and injustices you have faced are also real. Healing and transformation are long, messy, and constantly evolving processes. They involve building self-awareness through the reflections and feedback our comrades offer and being honest with ourselves. They include learning how to listen to others, show gratitude, and offer repair and care. They involve taking the risk to be vulnerable and open to the possibility of the kind of radical love that changes our core understanding of ourselves and the world.I still have episodes, and I still lose time. I still have days where I cannot get out of bed or where all I can do is cry from the weight of it all. I still get furious at the people who harmed me. When I stopped spiraling out about my failure and instead listened to what my body was telling me in a moment, it changed how I could be with those feelings. When I learned more about my ancestry and history, from my family of origin, chosen family, and movement family, I understood that I have never been alone, even in my loneliest moments.As a reflection, compassionate witness, and someone who still believes we will win, I ask you to stay mad with me. Remember that when you are vulnerable and speak your truth, you are participating in changing the world. All transformation begins with us choosing to love and honor every part of ourselves and learning how to try and love every aspect of each other.Our madness is a part of our resistance. Our failure to comply is resistance. Us choosing each other over the almighty dollar is resistance.Stay mad, comrades, and stay together. With Love and Solidarity, Elliott",

      "title": "Stories as evidence",
      "abstract": "Abstract People often use personal stories to support and defend their views. But can a personal story be evidence? A story tells us that a certain event can happen and has already happened to someone, but it may not always help us understand what caused the event or predict how likely that event is to happen again in the future. Moreover, people confabulate. That is, when they tell stories about their past, they are likely to distort reality in some way. When people who lack access to what motivated past behaviour are asked why they made a choice, they tend to offer plausible considerations in support of that choice, even if those considerations could not have played a motivating role in bringing about their behaviour. When people experience impairments in autobiographical memory, they tend to fill the gaps in their own story by reconstructing significant events to match their interests, values, and conception of themselves. This means that people often offer a curated version of the events they describe. In this paper, we argue that the pervasiveness of confabulation does not rule out that personal stories can be used as evidence but invites us to reflect carefully about what they are evidence of. And this is especially important in the context of digital storytelling, because stories shared on online platforms can exert even greater influence on what people think and do.",

      "abstract": "When we analyze the real objective behind all our activities, we find that it is noting but happiness. The immediate objective may be buying a house, winning a fight or earning some money; but the ultimate objective is always to gain happiness. If the ultimate objective is to gain happiness, it is necessary to orient our activities properly in order to gain maximum happiness. Wrong oriented activities may fail to achieve our goal and result in unhappiness, pain, anger and frustration.Different philosophical schools define happiness differently. Some say that happiness is a mental phenomenon and purely subjective (created by our own mind), some say that it is objective (comes from outside), some others say that it is a combination of mental and physical phenomena (created by our mind because of events outside). Some believe that the true happiness comes from satisfaction of doing good things. Some believe that happiness comes from within, from the internal self. Some believe that happiness comes from God. Some believe that happiness comes from the object or person whom you love, may be your spouse, may be your profession, may be from music.TRIZ is a method of high level of commonsense and can be applied in any field, whether social, economical, technical or spiritual. This article analyzes the concept of happiness, the ultimate goal of human being, and demonstrates the application of different TRIZ concepts like Ideality, contradictions, Principles, Resources and Trends in different theories of maximizing happiness.",

      "title": "An Unfinished Story, an Unfinished Body: How Missing Health Histories Predispose Adoptees to Illness",
      "abstract": "An Unfinished Story, an Unfinished Body: How Missing Health Histories Predispose Adoptees to Illness Shannon Gibney The first time I had a major depressive episode I was 20, on summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college. I had some idea of what was happening to me, that it was not within the “normal” ups and downs of everyday life; that the intractable nature of my sadness and anxiety had rapidly become a black hole whose gravity I could not escape. But the word “depression,” in the clinical sense, was not something I recognized—in myself or others. I simply thought that my mind, which has always been overly imaginative on the one hand, and prone to catastrophic thinking on the other, was in a temporary state of imbalance that I would have to pull myself out of. But as getting out of bed became increasingly difficult each morning, and the sensation of being underwater relative to the rest of the world permeated every social interaction, I came to the uneasy realization that this was different. I could see the “normal” world and level of perception I had existed in for most of my life, and I felt a world—a whole universe apart. Every day felt like a year, and the simplest tasks became monumental. For a high-functioning person like me, this was even more devastating. I had met my birth mother earlier that year, and through a series of discussions and interactions learned some pieces of my health history I had never known before. Like the fact that she had been an alcoholic for 17 years, barely surviving the disease intact. She had never used the words “clinical depression” with me in her descriptions of what had led her to self-medicate through alcohol in the first place, but I knew that addiction comes out of sadness and anger—both emotions closely tied to depression. And she told me once that, beginning when I was six, and for years afterwards, she would tell her family, my aunts and uncles and grandmother, that she was coming for me, that she was “going to get her.” Then they would have to convince her that she couldn’t do that, would never find me anyway, that she would have to let the loss go somehow, some way, sometime. But some losses you never really recover from. I believe that relinquishing me for adoption was that kind of loss for my birth mother. And that although she might not have known it, she was drawn to alcohol because of the deep clinical depression she suffered because of my adoption. I began talking to a therapist during that summer, the summer I was 20, and I told her of this family health history, the pieces that I knew anyway. [End Page 109] I also told her the other piece I had discovered the year before; that my birth father had died in a high-speed police chase when I was six. I knew his family was in Detroit, and had even spoken to my grandfather, his father, on one occasion, but that was pretty much all the information I had about him at that point. It was only later that I would meet my aunt, who would tell me that my father had suffered from what she termed “severe emotional problems,” and that he had gone AWOL in the Air Force. Having that information, along with the knowledge of my birth mother’s addiction and probable clinical depression, was what finally led me to get on medication for depression and anxiety when I was 26, and suffering my second major bout of clinical depression. At that point, I had been struggling through severe depression and anxiety for more than a year, which had been triggered by a break up with a man I was engaged to. Weekly talk therapy sessions were having minimal to no effect, and I began to fear that I would never be able to get myself out of that alternate universe of pervasive sadness and anxiety. My therapist had suggested medication on more than one occasion, but I had declined, insisting that I wanted to “work...",

      "abstract": "Words alone are labels and tools that both men and women use to convey or communicate ideas and ideals. In the hands of considerate people, words become an instrument used to cheer up a friend, or to express and share joy with those we love. Birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas and New Year‟s cards are all examples that demonstrate the positive use of words. However, people also use words to hurt, denigrate, incite hate and dehumanize others. Throughout history, men and women have deliberately used words to reduce fellow men and women to abstract, insubstantial and nonrepresentational names such as savage, alien, cripple, virus, parasites, fetus, nigger and kike; these theoretically non-human characterizations enables those who lack sensitivity and genuine concern for others to inflict unimaginable injury deeply wounding our core essence and spirit. At some point, we must draw a line and separate ourselves from those who are insensitive to others and who choose to demonstrate their insensitivity by the choice of words they use to communicate with others. For those self-absorbed, with no particular interest in humanity, this essay will only irritate you to further embrace your “Raison D'être”. On the other hand, the truly human individual must force her or himself to carefully choose words that not only accurately communicate, but also reflect a deliberate consideration for the sensitivities others.",

      "abstract": "Crítica y meneítos (para arriba y para abajo) Elsa Drucaroff Rubí Carreño. Av. Independencia. Literatura, música e ideas de Chile disidente. Santiago: Editorial Cuarto Propio, 2013. Pp. 242. ISBN 97895626063325. FONDECYT 1110482. Dicen que quienes escriben crítica hubieran querido escribir literatura pero en vez de arriesgarse prefieren el lugar del especialista, desde el que opinan con fundamento docto, analizan riesgos ajenos con pretendida objetividad, suben o bajan el pulgar a quienes se expusieron con su obra. Tienen bastante razón: gran parte de la crítica habla así. Av. Independencia hace lo contrario: está visceralmente decidida a que la crítica sea otra cosa sin renunciar a ser especialista o plantear fundamentos. Pero no se apoya en ellos para salvarse del riesgo sino que proclama sus puntos de vista, su subjetividad y más que subir o bajar pulgares hace preguntas, opina fuerte, cuenta sus gustos (a menudo poco “políticamente correctos”), dialoga con libros, canciones, películas, danzas, movidas culturales, expresiones artísticas. Lo hace no desde el lugar asimétrico de la académica sino desde la democrática posición de la semejante, la lectora que escucha, baila y aplaude o no; la que sí estudia y se especializó pero no se arroga por eso superioridad y sabe que “tiene que haber un cablecito que una la obra y vida para que haya cierta electricidad”. En mi país se llama patovica al grandote que decide en los dancings quién entra y quién no, porque no tiene aspecto “correcto”. Hay una crítica patovica: cuida la puerta del Parnaso de la literatura para que no entre ningún morochito, ninguna pobretona. Av. Independencia… no es ni podrá nunca leerse como crítica patovica. Elegí estudiar literatura, como muchos, por el enorme placer que me daban los libros, ventanas audaces para pensar cualquier cosa, criticar mi mundo, disfrutar o sufrir locamente mundos alternativos, identificarme con existencias diferentes en muchas situaciones. Deseaba con hambre profundizar, entender qué era, cómo se definía, se seguía pensando eso que era un centro en mi vida: la literatura. Pero cuando entré a estudiar entendí que mis motivos no eran bienvenidos. Por interesante que fuera la teoría literaria, tenía por objetivo hacerme desistir de conectar la literatura con la (mi) vida. Me predicaban que lo verosímil no es lo real y la ficción, autónoma. Tenían razón, pero agregaban que jamás debíamos volver a permitir que las emociones ganaran porque esos mundos donde nos sumergíamos antes de ser especialistas eran alucinaciones producidas por signos; la literatura es únicamente procedimiento y por eso no corresponde juntarla con la vida, la [End Page 201] rabia o el deseo. Y mucho menos con la política. “Los peligros de leer en la cama” es un artículo de Av. Independencia. … cuyo título remite al libro de la argentina Mariana Enríquez pero alude a algo más: lo que quisieron enseñarme y tantos enseñan es eso: no se lee en la cama sino en el escritorio, derechita la columna, midiendo cada palabra para que no haya riesgo. Porque en Argentina o Chile vimos qué les pasó a quienes leyeron de cualquier modo, en cualquier lado. Muchos eligieron nuestra especialidad por mis motivos pero algunos se domesticaron y ahora domestican nuevos estudiantes. Unos pocos seguimos leyendo en la cama. Sabemos de procedimientos, verosimilitud, autonomía del arte y especificidad y consistencia de la semiosis que no se funde con eso que llaman real, pero conservamos la fuerza joven que nos empujó a elegir la literatura. Aprendimos que para estudiar obras literarias con rigor (y para escribirlas) se necesita conciencia del procedimiento pero no eludimos la vida por eso y damos pelea contra este mundo injusto. Carreño no se regodea en su posición de enunciadora prestigiosa o en el placer narcisista de la letra impresa para el currículum; tampoco en la trillada moda de las poéticas jergas huecas del postestructuralismo francés. Rubí denuncia: los profesores de literatura piden “el mero reconocimiento de estructuras y conceptos teóricos” ya desde la secundaria y...",

Their play of repeatedly dropping objects for their parents to pick up demonstrates their need to be reassured that mother and father are reliably present to respond to them. The children's repeated requests for a fairy tale to be read suggest that the imaginative portrayal of love, loss, jealousy, hate, courage, and hope captures the children's emotional experiences which urgently require dramatisation and thinking by the child in the security of the parents' supportive, thoughtful presence. Patrizia Pasquini, the founder of Tempo Lineare, has fully appreciated children's urge to give expression to their emotions through listening to stories, playing with their little box of toys, as well as with each other, and listening to the fairy tales. Tempo Lineare gives credence to the belief that children need the emotional space to discover the well of creative imagination within themselves.",

We cannot tell you how to feel, because you feel what you feel and we cannot deny that or tell you not to feel it. What we do know (and we're guessing you know this too) is that guilt is not a very productive feeling. Guilt is only useful if it causes you to realize that your privilege is not a result of anything intrinsically more valuable about you than someone born with less privilege. In other words, those with less privilege didn't necessarily do anything \"bad\" or \"worse\" to be where they are in life-they started off at a different place in life with different resources and opportunities. And we're only speaking from our experience, but guiltoften makes us uncomfortable and not willing to engage. So feel your guilt, embrace your guilt and then throw it away. Say this out loud (no, we're not joking), \"Hello guilt, you are not helping me. I am going to say 'Goodbye to you.'\" (We suggest that you say this to the tune of \"Goodbye to You\" by The Veronicas or the Patti Smith version-you've likely heard this song before. Look for it on YouTube.)We all have to try to understand other people's experiences and withhold judgment. (No, it's not always easy, and you won't get it right all the time.) Privilege isn't necessarily positive or negative-it just is. Our realization that it exists and that it influences our chances in life is what matters.

      "title": "Obscured Beginnings in Personal Narratives of Sexual Jealousy and Trauma",
      "abstract": "Obscured Beginnings in Personal Narratives of Sexual Jealousy and Trauma Mark E. Workman (bio) As long ago as Aristotle a well-constructed narrative was defined as having a beginning, a middle, and an end. And yet, not all narratives conform to this norm. There are those that don't by virtue of the incompetence of their performers. But there are also those that don't by virtue of the fact that their would-be performers do not have access to the full range of experience that a complete mimetic narrative purports to represent. In what follows I am particularly interested in exploring personal experience narratives with imperfect beginnings, imperfect not because their performers do not know how to craft a well-told story but because they are not able, for one reason or another, to adequately retrieve the moment in which their narratives have their inception. I am interested, in other words, in narrators who—unlike their omniscient third-person counterparts—lack essential information and who thus are doomed to produce a type of narrative that I identify as \"flawed\" because of the narrator's awareness of and preoccupation with an originary event that the narrator strives to envelop within her story but that lies beyond her narratival grasp. I turn first to narratives derived from the experience of sexual jealousy and proceed from there to a discussion of narratives of trauma. I conclude by generalizing about the role of secrets in the construction of stories. What I hope to demonstrate is that some of the most interesting stories are those that allude to obscured beginnings and that are thus destined thereafter to approach their subjects in a manner that can best be described, to invoke Emily Dickinson, as necessarily \"aslant the truth.\" [End Page 249] I. Sexual Jealousy Attempting to recall the first occasion of physical intimacy between himself and his fiancée, so powerful as to have obliterated his consciousness of the event, the narrator of Peter Nadas's remarkable novel A Book of Memories observes that \"memory cannot retain what the body had not been aware of\" (74). Somewhat modified, this comment provides a useful point of entry into an understanding of the relationship between sexual jealousy and memory. In the case of sexual jealousy, I would suggest, the governing principle is not that memory is unable to retain what was originally insufficiently registered, but that, to paraphrase Nadas, memory cannot attain what the body had not experienced in the first place. And yet, it is precisely that attainment—impossible as its realization might be—which sexual jealousy dooms its victims to pursue. Sexual jealousy and memory are therefore inextricably bound together, albeit negatively so. Memory, otherwise a potential reservoir of identity and meaning, is in the case of sexual jealousy its perverse other: for where memory exists, jealousy does not, whereas in memory's absence, jealousy thrives. If memories are predicated upon experience, then sexual jealousy arises because of its victims' failure to have participated in those occasions that, as they recognize only belatedly, they are most eager to preserve in their recollections of the past. Furthermore, in its most interesting instances, such missed opportunities are hardly a function of chance; rather, they result from what victims painfully perceive to have been the intentional denial of their right to experiences that no one has a greater claim on than themselves. Arguably, there is of course no jealousy more riveting, intense, or consequential than the jealousy aroused by sex. Where other jealousies eventually may subside or even be dispelled altogether, according to many accounts sexual jealousy leaves a scar on the psyches of its victims like earth scraped raw by receding glaciers. For that reason, sexual jealousy adheres to—or more precisely, paradigmatically defines—the pattern described above. It arises, as Harold Bloom puts it, when one imagines two bodies in bed together, one of which should have been one's own but wasn't (15). The presence of an interloper and the absence of the self reiterate the inverse bond between memory and sexual jealousy: it is another who has appropriated the memories to which the self was entitled but couldn't acquire because it was...",

Andree Chedid’s novel, The Sixth Day – our point of departure here – poses and suggests a provocative response to this question, to how we might see one another as cohabitants, to how we might engage in a “politics of deep solidarity” (Alexander 2020). More than empathy or compassion, this sharing or solidarity demands we take on our portion of the trouble of others; it makes clear the need for “political friendship” (Allen 2004) or “political solidarity” (Scholz 2008) or “solidarity with strangers” (Dean 1996). And if we can see and hear the demand for sharing the trouble of others, can we imagine putting it into practice (the story Chedid’s novel tells), recognizing that the alternatives are, literally, deadly? In reflecting on our initial question, we arrived at another: what happens to the possibility of solidarity with those whom we do not, or refuse, to see? Drawing on our personal, intellectual, and political experiences, we reflect on these questions, following the lead of material-world clinical cases and of imaginative fiction to point to a radically inclusive sharing that, we argue, our historical moment demands.

It is not about doing or being as much as it is about intention and motivation. Similar to compassion, grief is also a reminder of people's shared humanity. People grieve because they have engaged and invested in an aspect of life that suddenly is no more. They lose those that they love. People must leave places and careers that formed their core sense of identity. Compassion acknowledges the presence of suffering and the desire to relieve that suffering in whatever ways are possible. Grief reminds people that some wounds must be carefully tended, with a shared sense of presence in the midst of tremendous pain.",

      "title": "Pandemic boredom or #nursestrong?",
      "abstract": "FigureI read an article in The New York Times about people suffering from pandemic boredom and had to chuckle. Not that I don't empathize with those suffering from boredom, but that's about the last thing nurses around the globe are experiencing. After all, we're #nursestrong, albeit exhausted. I do miss planning vacation adventures in faraway places, having large family get-togethers, attending professional conferences, and many more nonboring activities from prepandemic life, but boredom? Certainly not when our work lives are so intense and for many of you, your personal lives too. Would we wish for boredom now? I don't think so. You could argue the case that facing the same challenges every day is boring. And we currently have so many challenges, sometimes seemingly insurmountable. It's the opposite of boring to work toward solutions every day. The relational nature of our work also contrasts to monotony—no two interactions are the same, whether with each other, patients, families, or even our bosses. We literally learn every day from our work. Our work feels different now. Aren't we more innovative and creative in problem solving, from disrupted everyday processes to the larger issues of health equity and nursing's voice? If you did teeter into feeling uninterested or unexcited, this isn't the time to be uninspired. We have a future to build. Which brings us to the renewal of the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife, which was extended into 2021, and International Nurses Day this month. The main theme as announced by the International Council of Nurses (ICN) is \"Nurses: A Voice to Lead.\" ICN CEO Howard Catton, RN, notes that the theme \"speaks to the importance of nursing leadership and the issues...we know that we've had with nursing voices not being heard or included at the high tables for health systems and policy decision-making.\" This work isn't boring, it's #nursestrong. The National Academy of Medicine report on the Future of Nursing 2020-2030, supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was also delayed from last year to 2021. As a result of the pandemic and its effect on our profession, revisions were needed. The commission's insight into charting our course to 2030 is eagerly awaited; we can expect an emphasis on health equity, community health, diversity, nursing's voice, education and, of course, leadership. Are we \"lucky\" not to be facing pandemic boredom as some of our neighbors might be? It's hard to find anything lucky about what we've been through, but those of you good at reframing know that we've made a difference in many lives and learned innumerable lessons for the future, personally and professionally. The New York Times article that started my whole line of thinking ends with the thought that boredom forces us to think differently. If you do have more time to ponder, use it to de-stress, find creativity, and think of new goals—for every day and the big picture as a nurse leader. When we're #nursestrong, there's nothing that stands in our way. Let this Nurses Month be full of joy in your own professional practice!Figure[email protected]",

      "abstract": "EnglishWhat leads a lover, frustrated with the end of a love affair, to the killing of his (her) own partner? We know that love, in its narcissistic and specular face, can be dangerous, because it is often necessary to eliminate the partner lover to avoid disappearing in the subject who is in love. In the other hand, danger can also be present in a situation, in which there is a feeling of possession that comes as a correlation between being and having. Love can extend itself from union to destruction and frustration plays an important role in this way of transition. The author, using these ideas to think about passional crimes, so common nowadays, seeks to understand the behavior of these individuals who destroy their love objects. portuguesO que leva um amante, mediante a frustracao trazida pelo termino de uma relacao amorosa, a matar o ser amado? E sabido que o amor, em sua face narcisica e especular, pode ser perigoso, pois muitas vezes se faz necessaria a eliminacao do parceiro para evitar o desaparecimento do sujeito. Por outro lado, o perigo pode estar presente tambem numa outra situacao na qual se evidencia um sentimento de posse e uma correlacao entre o ser e o ter. O amor pode ir da uniao a destruicao e a frustracao desempenha nessa transicao um papel muito importante. E e atraves da abordagem e aplicacao destas ideias aos crimes ditos passionais, tao comuns nos dias de hoje, que a autora busca um olhar sobre o comportamento desses sujeitos que destroem seus objetos de amor.",

      "title": "The right way to be fired.",
      "abstract": "Nearly all of us will lose our jobs sometime, but is there a right way to be terminated? What differentiates fired employees who make the best of their situations from those who do not? One answer is mind-set. Many workers unconsciously hold a \"tenure mind-set,\" believing in the promise of employment security. By contrast, other workers hold an \"assignment mentality,\" seeing each job as one in a series of impermanent, career-building stepping-stones. Most corporate board members and CEOs have this latter mind-set and consider their executives to be filling terminal assignments; people who possess this mentality usually rebound swiftly when fired. But when employees who hold a tenure mind-set are suddenly fired or laid off, the authors say, they can fall into three common traps. Executives who have overidentified with their jobs and feel indispensable to their organizations get caught in the \"lost identity\" trap; they react to termination with anger and bitterness. In the \"lost family\" trap, employees possess tight-knit, emotional bonds with coworkers. When terminated, they feel betrayed and rejected. And finally, some introverted executives fall into the \"lost ego\" trap; they quietly retreat without negotiating fair termination packages and may settle for less satisfying work the next time around. To prepare for the eventuality of termination, the authors suggest that executives adopt the assignment mind-set at all times. They should keep their social networks alive, include a termination clause in employment contracts, and consider hiring an agent. If warning signs warrant, they might even volunteer to be terminated. By assuming control over the way they are fired, people can gain control over their careers.",

I am grateful to Greg Currie, Tyler Doggett, Anna Ichino and Jennifer Nagel for their immensely thoughtful and insightful challenges. Responding adequately to all of the issues that they raise would take many more pages than I have been allotted. So I will limit myself to those that seem to be of widest concern. Most of these challenges centre on the account of alief that I offer in ‘Alief and Belief’ and ‘Alief in Action (and Reaction.)’ I will begin with some general remarks about the notion, and then turn to some of the specific worries raised in the individual papers. The idea of alief was initially introduced to make sense of a familiar phenomenon. We often find ourselves in the following situation. Our beliefs and desires mandate pursuing behaviour B and abstaining from behaviour A, but we nonetheless find ourselves acting – or feeling a propensity to act – in A-like ways.1 These tendencies towards A-like behaviours are highly recalcitrant, persisting even in the face of our conscious reaffirmation that B-without-A is the course of action to which we are reflectively committed. It seems misleading to describe these A-like behaviours as fully intentional: their pursuit runs contrary to what our reflective commitments mandate. But it also seems wrong to describe them as fully reflexive or automatic: they are the kinds of behaviours that it makes sense – at least in principle – to attribute to a belief–desire pair, even though in this case (I argue) it would be mistaken to do so.",

It is delicious anguish, gut-wrenching pain, and intoxicating allure. Nations go to war over it, crimes are committed to satisfy its demands, lives are often ruined because of it, and extraordinary feats of courage and sacrifice are performed in its name. But beyond the cliches and greeting card platitudes, do we really understand what love is, and how it alters the way we think, feel, and behave? Should love be viewed as little more than a lusty romp, or is there more to it? What is the relationship between love and romance, caring, concern, compassion, thoughtfulness, sex, and the many other components that our society jumbles together in this potent potpourri whose power can give strength to the weakest among us, or turn powerhouses of strength into emotional mush. It is precisely because love is such an important part of our lives that we owe it to ourselves to reach beyond overwhelming passion and the roadblocks of illusion to achieve real understanding of this extraordinary human phenomenon. It won't always be easy - in fact, it's sometimes quite painful. But the rewards are many for those who will risk exploring their own cherished attitudes about a subject that has held us in its grip for centuries and shows no signs of letting go. Some of the topics covered are: - What I Feel in My Heart - On the (Alleged) Origins of Romantic Love - What Do I Want When I Want You? - Why Do I Love You? - The Importance of Being Honest - Love, Sex, and Intimacy - Beyond Sex and Gender - What's So Good About Love?",

This search involved engaging in various dialogues with others, as well as documentaries, books, movies, and music lyrics. I hoped that other people might have within their world a new, believable narrative they might share with me. While searching, when I was ten years old, I met an adult who wanted to have sex with me. This stirred up confusing, confl icting thoughts and emotions for me, including guilt, enjoyment, and fear. This went on in secret for years and was, on balance, a traumatic experience. There were also positive experiences growing up – love, stability, and family holidays. ‘To cut a long story short’, I developed some habits of thinking, feeling and acting in reaction to being sexually abused as a child. These habits included anger and resentment towards my abuser; guilt and shame; feeling very anxious when I thought about having adult sexual relationships; suicidal thoughts and wanting to self-harm. I also developed the habit of drinking alcohol to excess as a way to kill the pain of unbearable emotions. Simultaneously, I formed positive habits of thought and emotion, such as compassion, wanting to help others, and a strong feeling for social justice.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Memory loss and other cognitive decline threaten people's capacities to make sense of the world and their position within it. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such losses occur when the desire to make sense of the experienced world remains. When this desire cannot be satisfied, confusion, agitation, or anger may result. In these situations, a resolution aiming at the truth is not guaranteed to work, and may even exacerbate a difficult situation, since losses to sense making may damage even the receptivity to it. When the truth is out of reach in this way, the aim ought to be instead to create the conditions of proper fit – a fit that is intelligible – between current experience, self‐image, and a world that makes sense. We argue that this aim rests on what we call the demand for sense‐making, a demand that arises for all of us where respect for agency is at stake, and especially so in AD, when it is under threat.",

      "title": "Ontological Security and Natural Hazards",
      "abstract": "People not only want to <italic>be</italic> safe from natural hazards; they also want to <italic>feel</italic> they are safe. Sometimes these two desires pull in different directions, and when they do, this slows the journey to greater physical adaptation and resilience. All people want to feel safe—especially in their own homes. In fact, although not always a place of <italic>actual</italic> safety, in many cultures “home” is nonetheless idealized as a place of security and repose. The feeling of having a safe home is one part of what is termed <italic>ontological security</italic>: freedom from existential doubts and the ability to believe that life will continue in much the same way as it always has, without threat to familiar assumptions about time, space, identity, and well-being. By threatening our homes, floods, earthquakes, and similar events disrupt ontological security: they destroy the possessions that support our sense of who we are; they fracture the social structures that provide us with everyday needs such as friendship, play, and affection; they disrupt the routines that give our lives a sense of predictability; and they challenge the myth of our immortality. Such events, therefore, not only cause physical injury and loss; by damaging ontological security, they also cause emotional distress and jeopardize long-term mental health. However, ontological security is undermined not only by the occurrence of hazard events but also by their anticipation. This affects people’s willingness to take steps that would reduce hazard vulnerability. Those who are confident that they can eliminate their exposure to a hazard will usually do so. More commonly, however, the available options come with uncertainty and social/psychological risks: often, the available options only <italic>reduce</italic> vulnerability, and sometimes people doubt the effectiveness of these options or their ability to choose and implement appropriate measures. In these circumstances, the risk to ontological security that is implied by action can have greater influence than the potential benefits. For example, although installing a floodgate might reduce a business’s flood vulnerability, the business owner might feel that its presence would act as an everyday reminder that the business, and the income derived from it, are not secure. Similarly, bolting furniture to the walls of a home might reduce injuries in the next earthquake, but householders might also anticipate that it would remind them that there is a continual threat to their home. Both of these circumstances describe situations in which the anticipation of future feelings can tap into less conscious anxieties about ontological security. The manner in which people anticipate impacts on ontological security has several implications for preparedness. For example, it suggests that hazard warnings will be counterproductive if they are not accompanied by suggestions of easy, reliable ways of eliminating risk. It also suggests that adaptation measures should be designed not to enhance awareness of the hazard.",

      "title": "<b>Standpoint:</b>Disappearing authors: A postmodern perspective on the practice of writing for the screen",
      "abstract": "The practice of writing for the screen is unlike most other current forms of creative writing in that individual authorship is usually neither privileged nor valued, as it is with the novel, the poem, or the play. The writer of the screenplay or teleplay in most cases is one member of an amorphous unconnected creative collective (the term team does not always apply here) that includes the director, producer, crew members, other writers, even actors changing words on the set. It is as if the work is too large for any one creative force and demands the attention of multiple minds. Each screenplay absorbs the efforts of numerous individuals until it becomes impossible to determine or remember or care about who contributed what passages. It is through this practice that, in a postmodern sense, authors disappear into the works they help write. This disappearance is never logical or planned; it just happens, haphazardly, by chance, illogically. Most screenwriters are not happy about this process, but nevertheless learn to deal with it and to live with it. Some have come to accept-- and seek solace in--the rationale that screenplays are merely blueprints, not finished works, and are therefore not worth serious authorial investment on their part. But screenplays are other (and more) than that; they are unique and uniquely (post)modern works, in part because authorship is neither privileged nor commonly shared and is often uncredited. They are models for a new way of writing that somehow just happens, always mutating works that are created in myriad ways that are beyond prediction. By looking at the practice of making them, they can serve as pedagogical models for our times, showing us how to make things in common that are astounding in their uncommonness. So, what is a screenplay? Impossible To Read in the Tub For(e)most, Hollywood teleplays and screenplays are unintimidating. A hundred or so pages of welcoming words, words written to be read out loud, words that cry out to be loved. Sally Fields is the screenplay personified. Take me, want me, love me, shower me with praise and attention; if you don't like me, change me, do with me as you will, just do me, adore me, quote me, immortalize me. The screenplay: often ignored, insulted, cursed, victimized, shelved, shredded and fed to goats. The screenplay: a blueprint, a map, a vision, words for actors to say, to inhabit, alter, explode. The screenplay: another Hollywood dirty secret, suddenly exposed, fodder for scholars, archaeologists digging for an Oprah invite, pop culture's books of genesis, empirical evidence of minds at work to bridge, fuse, rip asunder the real and the phantasmagorical. The screenplay: a notoriously unstable launching pad to wondrously seductive worlds of dancing images that mirror, imitate, celebrate, interpret, create, condemn, encourage, distort, and/or praise that smoldering bubbling thing that we like to call, generously and unconditionally, culture---with a little c, of course. The screenplay: a tiny pitless and pitiful acorn from which, oftentimes, nothing grows. A thin, slippery creature, three holes, two brads, impossible to read in the tub. Screenplays and teleplays are mostly written in a rush where time is measured in weeks. They are read as oddly incomplete and ragged works, reckless and careless much of the time, with little conviction (and even less passion), as if the writers knew that they were writing unseriously and in pencil. Larry McMurtry (1987) has written a few for mini-series and movies and says: The screenplay is only secondarily a written thing; it is an elaborate notion, a kind of codified visualization. It is the kind of work that does not require the writer to wrestle overly much with his psyche. It can be written quickly and, fortunately, rewritten quickly (p. 34). Pier Paulo Pasolini (1991), who wrote and directed a few, takes the thought deeper, noting that the screenplay is always a joint (ad)venture between author and reader where: the author . …",

      "title": "The Root Cause Of Violence In Nigeria: The Niger Delta Crisis, A Reference Point",
      "abstract": "The world is a puzzle but the puzzle of all puzzles is man. Nothing that shows this nature of man more than his behaviour, which is full of contradictions. He loves and as well hates, builds and as well destroys, gathers and as well scatters, purifies and as well corrupts, refines and as well defiles, praises and as well condemns, etc, in his bid to make one thing or the other out of his wealthy-wretched existence. His whole existence is mostly informed by these contradictory actions of his, which have made him a big riddle. The focus of this work is on violence, one aspect of his behaviours, which exemplifies so much his enigmatic life. Man wherever he is, shows signs of violence either overtly or covertly in words or actions. He is either fighting or preparing to fight; either he is moody counting his loses of past fight or busy celebrating the dividends of his pyrrhic victory. To find him idle without being busy thinking about one ill-will, one complaint, one insult, one offence, one attack, one grudge or another against this or that person, this or that country, this or that idea, this or that opinion, etc, is like expecting a child hale and hearty who is not asleep to remain calm. That is not possible. Nigerians have often been roasted in the flame of violence. What is the root cause of this violence? What prices have Nigerians been paying for it? Is there anything that can be done to avert it completely or reduce the rate at which it occurs? These are main questions to be addressed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Discussing happiness, which has been at the forefront of human endeavour since time immemorial, is often deemed laughable and absurd or, at least, non-important. However, since it actually determines the quality of every single moment of our lives, it might be worthy of investigation. Here I present the view of happiness not as a certain feeling to be attained and maintained but as a skill that can be precisely defined and practiced. Specifically, I attempt to show the ways in which our existing notions about happiness are misguided and provide an answer as to what happiness really is and how it can be achieved. Through this investigation, we discover that happiness does not depend on particular circumstances, whether inner or outer, but on the quality of our relationship to circumstances in general. We also discover that the reason we have an unhealthy relationship to circumstances is ignorance of our mind’s true nature and potential, which generates a plethora of attachments and aversions which lead us to endless suffering. In order to end this ignorance, an expanded type of education and investigation are needed, specifically, the type which take into account the inner, mental dimension of life. It is, then, only through dedicated mind training that happiness can be attained. One example of such mind training is given in the form of Buddhist philosophy and spiritual practice, according to which happiness is only achievable through the diligent application of wisdom and compassion in our concrete, everyday life.",

The self-awareness, I think, helps them to trust their own instincts, which means they are going to have some freedom to work.

A mourner can step into the labyrinth, walk the path and then step back out of the labyrinth, using it as a means of accessing yet also containing strong emotions within the kinesthetic experience of walking a defined path that requires nothing more than beginning and continuing on the journey. A near-universal experience of comfort and safety in the center of the labyrinth is reported by walkers, with many experiencing it as sacred space where one is close to Holy Mystery or God. In this sacred space, deep emotions of grief—tears, regret, sadness, guilt, anger—are often released and may be offered to God or one's higher power. In some instances when the client is hesitant to walk the labyrinth or fears emotional release, the therapist might agree to walk behind or beside the client.",

      "abstract": "During tumultuous, shaky, and uncertain times such as COVID-19, understandings of and life at home have shifted dramatically, especially amidst lockdown or on-and-off stay-at-home orders. While staying at home made me feel a sense of safety and protection, lockdown was a whole other challenge. Staying at home from morning till dawn, doing the exact same things over and over again, and relying on technology more than ever to fuel my social needs, encompassed my lockdown routine; a routine developed out of desires for normalcy and desperation to feel a sense of stability and so-called productivity. In light of my sanity and survival, I had to make do. I had to improvise. I had to find ‘leisure’ that worked for me while the world moved cautiously amidst COVID. In the details of everyday pandemic life, I found leisure in improvisation. In some cases such as my lockdown experience, leisure can be found in improvisation; not just in one thing or activity per se, but also in a series of pursuits that can help us make do, pass time, keep sane, and even experience temporary bliss and enjoyment amidst an unsteady and unpredictable environment.",

      "title": "Talking from 9 to 5 : women and men at work",
      "abstract": "You say something at a meeting, it is ignored, then someone else says the same thing and everyone embraces it as a marvelous idea. You devote yourself to a project, but don't get credit for the results. You work around the clock to avoid a crisis, but your efforts are not recognized because no one notices a crisis that never occurs. You give what you think are clear instructions, but the job is not done, or is done wrong. Sometimes it seems you are not getting heard, not getting credit for your efforts, not getting ahead as fast as you should. Many of us spend more of our lives at work than we do at home, yet while we choose our life-partners and friends, at work we are thrown together with people we did not choose, some of whom we don't understand and may not even like. In Talking from 9 to 5, Deborah Tannen brings to the workplace the same compelling voice, keen eye, and deep insight that made That's Not What I Meant! and You Just Don't Understand best-selling classics. Here, she offers powerful new ways of understanding what happens in the workplace, ranging from the simplest exchanges to the complex contemporary issues of the glass ceiling and sexual harassment. Work is a special world because as we talk to get our jobs done, we are also being evaluated. How we get others to do what we want, and how we accept or avoid responsibility for mistakes, display or challenge authority, reveal or conceal what we don't know - all affect how we are regarded and rewarded. Individuals in positions of authority are judged by how they enact that authority. This poses a particular challenge for women, since the ways that women are expected to talk are at odds with our usual images of authority.Women at work often have ways of creating authority that can be misinterpreted as a lack of confidence or even competence. Tannen maintains that no one style of speaking is superior. She does not tell women to speak like men or men to speak like women. Instead, she explains a variet",

      "title": "Working to Thrive, Not Just Survive: My Work History in a Sociological Imagination",
      "abstract": "In life there are few unavoidable truths. One truth that is accepted worldwide is that people must work to survive. What varies with the idea of work is how it is defined. In my view, work is defined as tasks that are completed whether for a monetary value or not so that an individual survives in their society. concept of work, in American culture, is something that can all at once be valued, despised, or envied. Work is valued because it is seen as necessary in society as a way to remain organized, and to provide for yourself or your family. For the past thirty years this nation's cost of living has been increasing while income has been falling. It takes more money each year to be able to afford necessities such as food and shelter, so it is important to bring in an income. In many ways work can be despised as well, because working is time being taken away from leisure or family time, and many individuals often feel stressed with the pressures of various work they do. Paid work is also something to be envied by many individuals. To be unemployed can add tremendous amounts of stress to an individual's life, as one may not be able to sufficiently provide for one's family or oneself. Joblessness or lack of regular employment in the labor force not only provides obvious financial strain on a person, but there are many psychological stressors as well. effects of joblessness can lead someone to not being able to provide a living for themselves, and not having consistent, dependable income can often lead people to feel inadequate in their abilities and depressed with their current predicament. Such feelings of hopelessness often lead people to leave the job search altogether, for fear that they will never be able to successfully gain employment (Wilson). Any type of work is important. Working allows people to feel productive, and if they are doing something they love, then that work can push them to strive to be better in life. While there will always be positive aspects as well as drawbacks, work is something that all humanity shares, and without it, the world most certainly would not function. Work has always been a major part of my life, both directly and indirectly. My family has always worked very hard to acquire what we have. My parents have always had a patchworking approach, or the sharing of diverse resources (Kibria, 60), to running our household. They both pitch in with various tasks, both paid and unpaid work, in order to run our home. While my parents always had strong work ethics, I cannot remember a time when paying all the bills was not a major stressor. pressure to pay the bills is a concern shared by many families across America, and yet I never went without any necessities like clothing, food or shelter. When I was very young my father was the breadwinner, or main supporter of our family (Brandt, 14), while my mother stayed home to raise my sister and me. This was by no means easy on our family financially, but my mother wanted time to spend with her children for a few years before we were old enough to enter preschool. While it is often the wish of many families to have a parent stay home when children are just born or very young, such a decision can often cause major stress for the household financially. This dilemma was ever so present in my family when I was a child as well. I have often asked my mother if she enjoyed being home with my sister and me when we were toddlers or if she wished she had maintained a career and put us in daycare sooner than she had. Her answer was always the same. She loved having the time with her children, but living on such a tight budget, and on only one income, was stressful. This dilemma, having the desire to raise your children but struggling with the loss of income, is described in Ann Crittenden's article The Mommy Tax. mommy tax refers to how women are at a disadvantage income-wise when it comes to having children. Women lose the possibility for potential income when having children for many reasons including unpaid maternity leave and the fact that woman only make about eighty cents to every dollar a man makes (Crittienden 71). …",

We may keep things which make life easier, help us in day-to-day living and might assist us in some future difficult time. We may also value those things with enriching associations – something we found on a memorable day; something which appealed to us for its form and beauty, its intricacy, diversity or simplicity; something inherited from an ancestor or given to us by a friend or parent. Or it can be something we did not know about but which we found out about in the media or which a teacher, parent or mentor told us was rare, valuable, a privilege to have. Thus, the meaning can be discovered by yourself or a meaning can be given to you by someone else which then becomes significant to you. Whatever the many reasons for keeping something, it is the value and the meanings which make us cherish it: the meanings vary widely, but meanings there have to be.

For example, depending on the piece of paper on which I write, they might represent the act of making a contract or, if the piece of paper is a cheque, of paying a bill. I am drawing here, on the distinction that Harre and Secord (1972) make between movements, actions and acts in their book The Explanation of Social Behaviour, which can help us to make sense of a variety of aspects of human experience. In the past, for example (Fairbairn, 1995) I used it in helping to unpick the differences between suicide and other acts that resemble, but are different from suicide , including ‘gestured suicide’, in which a person enacts what looks like suicide in the hope and expectation, not of dying, but of having an effect on other people such as moving them to despair or to feelings of guilt; and ‘cosmic roulette’, in which a person acts apparently suicidally, not with the intention of dying, but of inviting God or the cosmos to decide whether he lives. The distinction between acts and actions will also prove useful in thinking about the question of whether we can have bullying without a bully.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundA patient has an unwanted pregnancy ... is coming to terms with infertility ... gets a cancer diagnosis.All these scenarios occur if not often, at least regularly.All stir up strong feelings -tears, rage, fear, crisis -emotions that may spill out at any time, particularly in the consulting room.So I haven't been unduly surprised that in conversations with various health professionals over the past months one topic of conversation has kept recurring, namely \"What should we do when a patient gets emotional?\".Of course there is no unilateral 'what to do'; each health professional gives their own response informed by their own experience and training and the triggering problem.But while there's no one answer, there are certainly consistent guidelines on what emotions mean, how they reach boiling point, and how they can best be managed when that point is reached. What do emotions mean?First, some background.Emotion is an inbuilt human response -in fact, lack of emotion is so unusual and unwise that society labels it a mental illness.From birth, children naturally feel sad when they suffer a loss, feel angry when resisted, feel scared when there's a threat.They then cry, shout, tremble -not only because such activity reduces stress levels physiologically, but also as a way of 'enrolling the tribe', gathering social support for a problem and thus surviving it.Over time, of course, children learn that it's socially inappropriate to display a constant flow of feeling and that they must contain it, and by the time they reach adulthood it is only when crisis occurs and all the containment in the world is not enough that they display strong emotion.The patient who cries, rages or shakes with fear in your consulting room has reached that point.But when -and how -does anyone reach that point, where they are so overwhelmed that they break down?I've developed a simple formula (Box 1) to reflect what I've observed: a person's emotional level rises as a result of the opportunity to express emotion, the lack of internal strategies to self-calm, the perceived threat of the trigger, and the lack of external support. Four key elementsSo first, how much emotion people feel and display will depend on the opportunity they have to do so.In short, if it's 'safe' to cry, they will; if it doesn't feel safe, if there is no time, if other people aren't receptive, they will not only try to hold back the tears but also push down the inner feelings.This is why some patients seem to take devastating news so calmly in the consulting room.Once they are in the comfort of their own homes and in the shelter of their partner's arms they may well fall apart completely.",

      "abstract": "FigureDoesn't it seem like we're making a decision every minute? Whether simple, complex, or mind-boggling, every decision we make is watched by our staff and colleagues. These decisions offer a significant and truthful glimpse into our values, as well as tell the story of the workplace culture we promote. What messages are you sending with your decisions? Doughnuts for breakfast—you aren't health conscious. Staff meetings and celebrations held only during day-shift hours—you don't care about the night shift. No follow-up on new bedside report expectations—you don't think it really matters whether the expectations are met. Organizing the supply room by yourself—you don't value staff input. And these are just the simple decisions! Ineffective decision making is a major source of frustration for all of us. Using meaningful data instead of knee-jerk reactions to drive decisions is basic, but not consistently done. Building consensus around a decision instead of yes-no voting, or, even worse, autocratic pronouncements, is a solid strategy to improve buy in. Other fundamentals include being true to underlying core values and understanding downstream effects. Deciding how to decide is an important decision for you to make. Although you're ultimately accountable, aren't the best decisions made when end-user input is sought and considered? Isn't it even better when shared governance structures and processes are used? We've all rolled out decisions that made sense to us but failed when they reached our staff; stakeholder participation is essential. Compliance with regulations and standards may not be negotiable, but how we implement them usually is. The practice of allowing others to make decisions is a gift. It helps people grow, sends a message of inclusion and worthiness, and builds an attitude of decisiveness. If a staff member's decision doesn't produce positive results, it becomes a teaching point. As a leader, you should support the choice and help with the effects. Sometimes, reaching a decision seems so overwhelming that we simply avoid it. In that case, get help! You may need to talk through the process and your available options with an expert or hold multiple meetings to hash out details. We can't always foresee all of the consequences, and unintended consequences aren't always negative. Downstream effects must be considered, but not to the point of prolonged indecision. Evaluate quickly and regularly, and act on feedback. Remember that not making a decision is, in fact, a decision. It tells your staff that the status quo is fine and may even send the message that you aren't an effective leader. Strong leaders aren't afraid to make decisions, even if they make a mistake. Communicate the whys and circumstances of your choices, including what's out of your scope of authority. Use all of the resources, tools, and recommendations that you have at your disposal. Leadership is decision making—all day, every day. Whether you're making a decision or influencing one, make it count.Figure[email protected]",

      "abstract": "The best metaphor I know for the experience of observing political and security opinion in Israel is a long, extended roller-coaster ride. The ride goes along smoothly enough and then, quite without warning, the car takes a headlong plunge into the unknown, a dive which may be experienced as either terrifying or exhilarating, depending on one's point of view. Unlike an amusement park ride, however, this form of entertainment seems endless, with no finale leading to a smooth and soothing finish. In the past there has been one important regularity: that after an initial surge of change, things settle down and revert to familiar patterns with altered expectations for the next plummet. But there is no assurance that the jaunt will not spin out of control, and that after the next plunge the conductor (government) will not be able to assert authority as in the past, and will no longer take proud responsibility for the last surprise, or be in a position to exhort the public to prepare itself for future nasty turns.",

When training is really tough, do you ever say to yourself, “I am not good enough”? Do not worry, you are not alone in these tough times. All athletes—including us, the authors of this paper—have difficult sport experiences. Fortunately, there are skills we can learn to manage these difficult experiences! We can learn to recognize that sport is sometimes difficult and that all athletes mess up from time to time. We can also learn to be kind to, and supportive of, ourselves just like we would be to a close friend or teammate. Having self-compassion in sport can reduce the negative thoughts and feelings we might have about ourselves, and can decrease fears we might have about failing. Self-compassion can contribute to reaching our potential in sport; but how can we be self-compassionate?",

If he persists, insisting that he is not really lost, but only cannot find himself no matter how hard he looks, we might reasonably suspect that we are dealing with that peculiarly incorrigible academic explorer, the philosopher. When we hesitantly point to his body, we hear him explain, exasperated, ‘No, don't you get it? That's my body, but I’m looking for my self! And I cannot find it!’ At this point it is tempting to slip away, convinced that our philosophical friend is throttling himself with the noose of his own cleverness and is at risk of intellectual suicide by denying that he in fact has a self. Nevertheless, we shouldn't turn away so quickly: some pretty ingenious people from radically diverse schools of thought have endorsed the claim that the self ineluctably evades detection.",

      "abstract": "In this article, I suggest that doing nothing and being bored can be invaluable to the creative process. In our present networked society, introspection and reflection have become lost arts. Instead, we are at risk of becoming victims of informational overload. The balance between activity and inactivity has become seriously out of sync. However, doing nothing is a great way to induce states of mind that nurture our imagination. Slacking off may be the best thing we can do for our mental health. Seemingly inactive states of mind can be an incubation period for future bursts of creativity. Keeping busy can be a very effective defense mechanism for warding off disturbing thoughts and feelings. But by resorting to manic-like behavior we suppress the truth of our feelings and concerns, consciously or unconsciously avoiding periods of uninterrupted, freely associative thoughts. Yet unconscious thought processes can generate novel ideas and solutions more effectively than a conscious focus on problem solving. I end by recommending some actions and conditions that can help achieve this state of mind.",

And, on this road, I have tried to let go of the burden or let go of that which is not in accord with my desire. I have also written because I recognise my pain in other women and I know that words -of which I have needed so many- are a balm that, sometimes, even cure.

      "abstract": "In a small corner of Reddit, with just 4,000 followers, a subreddit called \"lifestories\" demonstrates the rich possibilities of life writing beyond the strict purview of identity markers. What emerges from a platform where anonymity is pervasive is not different from other digital life writing: Confessions, vignettes, and reminiscences. What anonymity appeared to afford was a more intimate set of themes: family, assault, abuse, suicide, relationships, pain, abandonment, hurt, sex, loss, parenthood, and depression. When considering how little we know about those existants who post, an interesting set of questions arise about identity, authenticity, and authorship. What is known begins and ends with the texts themselves and thus an \"imagined author\" (Das and Pavlíčková 2014) emerges. Much like an imagined audience, the space to co-constructed action and character appears to be limitless. As these posts are augmented with affirmation, questions, reflections, and advice by a second set of authors, whose identities are also submerged, the very nature of contingent identities becomes apparent for its malleability and vulnerability to interpretation. Using small stories research (Bamberg and Georgakopoulou 2008), we intend to examine forty well-engaged posts within the \"lifestories\" subreddit, to track the negotiations of meaning and identity within the writings and their responses. By gaining insights to the interaction of texts, we anticipate connections to the negotiation of anonymous identities formed within life writing texts.",

As divorce rates remain high and as more widows and widowers have many productive and healthy years ahead of them, finding love again can feel daunting, but now more than ever can be easier to find, to establish, and to keep. Using personal stories and expert research, Laura Stassi takes readers on a tour through the many ways older adults can find companionship, romance, and a fulfilling sex life through a variety of methods, outlets, and resources. Learning how to love again, how to form and deepen a relationship with a new person can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding, exciting, and successful, if you just know how to do it.

      "title": "Enduring COVID-19, nevertheless",
      "abstract": "This pandemic is a season of nevertheless; we are exhausted from all kinds of labour, but keep labouring nevertheless. This labouring, I suggest, takes three forms: doing (the productive and reproductive labour required to sustain life through a pandemic), undoing (the tedious processes of postponing and cancelling plans, or abandoning the process of planning altogether), and not-doing (passing the time left over between doing and undoing). Of course, the particularities of our doing, undoing, and not-doing will vary by our circumstances even as we operate within these general patterns of behaviour. I want to think through these neverthelesses as a way of mapping orientations toward the future fractured by the pandemic, and our collective persistence despite those fractures. Under normal circumstances, doing is an expression of optimism about the future, but the pandemic has quickened the tempo and increased the frequency of disappointment and continually forecloses possibility. Undoing is tiresome and painful, the necessary labour that amounts to less than nothing, begetting a collection of losses that often remain private and invisible. Not-doing is an intensified experience of boredom, with no obvious end or relief. Against the calls, which abound in the public culture of the pandemic, to treat COVID-19 as an opportunity to cultivate resilience, I posit endurance as an alternative framework. Resilience implies a better future if only we would learn how to suffer more productively. By contrast, endurance makes no such promises but fully acknowledges all the ways we might hurt, even as it functions as the nameless capacity that carries us through our doing, undoing, and not-doing – nevertheless.",

Old age involves various changes and losses which will be experienced differently by every person according to their one personality and life story.

Although most of our children do have a life-threatening illness of one kind or another, many of them have months and years of LIFE in front of them and we want to help them and their families to live life as fully and as happily as they can. 3. The strain and the loneliness for our families can be very great. We do not offer anything complex or sophisticated but try to be sensitive in responding to the very different individual needs of each family by giving support, using practical skills, and sharing a very ordinary kind of friendship. 4. Many of our children may only spend a few nights a year in Helen House itself, but through frequent telephone calls, letters or home visits we and they feel we share a very close friendship. For some perhaps we are able to take the place of the extended family so rarely in evidence now in our society.",

      "title": "Learning from Everyman: Thoughts on Spirituality, Love, and Death in the Lives of Older Couples",
      "abstract": "The power of forgiveness. Well, he was thrice divorced, a one-time serial husband distinguished no less by his devotion than by his misdeeds and mistakes, and he would have to continue to manage alone. From here on out he would have to manage everything alone.... It was time to worry about oblivion. It was the remote future. -Philip Roth, Everyman Not everyone has to manage alone, but for all of us, a remote future eventually becomes the present time. This is not a reality we accept easily. Philip Roth's stark and beautifully written book Everyman (2006) implicitly derides our theories of death and dying (life itself is die disease here) and our trust in medical technology, which works until it does not (Wood, 2006). The nameless, isolated 70-year-old we meet in diis novel describes himself as reasonable, kindly, and amicable. We find him to be self-centered as well. This protagonist has experienced a variety of physical problems and survived numerous medical interventions; like the internal dialogues of many chronically ill people, his are filled with images of medical terminology and an uncertain future. He has also repeatedly failed in his personal relationships-not only with his former wives and mistresses, but also with his sons, extended family, and friends. Roth's book is devoid of any sappiness. As in his previous novels, he anchors his story in the stark realities of a secular, urban world and portrays sentimental religiosity as just one more deceptive effort to ward off death. Instead, his hero attempts to stay young by rediscovering latent artistic talents and by forming relationships with ever-younger women. His gripping fear of death and consistently self-referential decisions undercut any ability to achieve lasting intimacy, and he constantly injures both himself and his family members. The pathos of this book is rooted in Rodi's portrayal of narcissistic inability to forgive. His hero cannot forgive himself, others, or providence. He cannot forgive himself for failing at his personal relationships and for not being the artist he might have been. He cannot forgive others for not living up to his expectations (or, in the case of his brother Howie, for transcending diem). And he cannot forgive life itself for disappointing him in his dreams of immortality. As I read Philip Rodi's elegant novel, I could not help thinking of my own clinical work with older couples. I wondered, Have I attended adequately to both the inner and outer worlds of the people who come to me? In Everyman, I had glimpses of one man's personal angst, but also of the very location where we work, the place where our theories hit the road-the streets of America. For this archetypical hero, the biological challenges of growing old intersected tragically with an ageist, spiritually deficient culture. I was reminded that many of us lack precisely those resources that can best sustain people in crises-mature, interpersonal relationships, a rich emotional life, and, above all, spiritual community (Ramsey and Blieszner, 1999). Roth's protagonist experiences life and death while haunted by fear, a powerful enemy of intimacy at any age. He reminds me how difficult it can be to forgive ourselves, to empathize with others, and to be reconciled with our own life stories. This man does not simply grieve the loss of his physicality-he grieves because he will never have a perfect relationship, never be a famous artist, never feel deeply connected to another human being. In long-term marriages, the necessity to forgive ourselves and others and to be reconciled to our own life story is often pivotal. Older couples have had much time together-time not only to get to know one another well, as is portrayed in our romanticized images, but also time to hurt and disappoint each other. Because the causes of marital distress are so diverse, dynamic, and complex (Gottman, 1982), and because the way couples react to their problems is far more significant than the number of problems they are experiencing (Beck, 1988), it can be important to go beyond the traditional approaches we learned as graduate students. …",

      "title": "Survivorship and discourses of identity",
      "abstract": "Personal identity is self-evidently important to us all. Identity is a philosophically complex subject, but there is some agreement that memory, embodiment and continuity are essential components. The sense of memory includes 'future memory', the kind of memory we would like to construct for ourselves as our lives proceed. While the sense of personal identity is internal to the individual, a sense of that person's identity exists in the minds of others. Extreme experiences threaten the element of continuity, because they may bring bodily changes as well as cognitive changes that challenge central values. Restoring or preserving continuity is a major task for survivors. The ways in which people experience discontinuity because of cancer illness, and the ways in which they manage this experience emerges from the narratives of the survivors of cancer and in the narratives of health care workers who look after them. People manage discontinuity by reference to stable 'anchor points' in their beliefs and values; by re-constructing versions of their pre-experience identities, drawing on past memory and finding ways to preserve a continuity between past memory, present experience and constructions of the future; by using the experience to develop established facets of identity; and by imbuing the experience with meaning and recognising the enlarged identity made possible by survival. Those who cannot achieve a sense of continuity may feel alienated from themselves, their friends and family. All these methods of management may be used by one person to negotiate the post-experience identity in its different social interactions. The experience of the survivor can be further understood by recognising the challenge posed by extreme experience to the sense of continuity of both embodied self and memory. A satisfactory discourse of survival has yet to enter the public domain. This lack adds to the burdens of survivors, including those who have survived cancer.",

      "title": "Addiction and Devotion in Early Modern England by Rebecca Lemon",
      "abstract": "Reviewed by: Addiction and Devotion in Early Modern England by Rebecca Lemon Emily C. Bartels ADDICTION AND DEVOTION IN EARLY MODERN ENGLAND. By Rebecca Lemon. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018; pp. 280. In Addiction and Devotion in Early Modern England, Rebecca Lemon succeeds in her primary purpose: to recover the idea of addiction as an admirable act of selfless devotion. She starts this provocative intervention by drawing attention to the etymology of addiction: “ad + dicere, ‘to speak, or say’” (ix). In early modern parlance, Lemon argues, the addict is not only someone who has been sentenced or condemned for compulsive behavior but also, non-pejoratively, someone who has pledged devotion to a person, object, or idea. Even in the best of cases, addiction poses challenges. Not every person has the “natural disposition” to become an addict (9), and not every addict will be able to sustain the commitment or surrender that comes from giving the self over to a higher power or aim. But whatever the outcome, importantly and originally here, addiction can signal a positive: an act of sacrifice and service undertaken by subjects who choose to dedicate themselves to some other and who, by forming a “deep” attachment to that other (xiv), undergo a transformative “shattering” of self (163). Lemon grounds her revisionary approach most persuasively when discussing nonfictional texts from the classical period through the Restoration, effectively rebuffing a “broad consensus” that understands addiction as a “modern discovery” (4). The concept of addiction, she demonstrates, is actually rooted in Reformation theology, which encourages the faithful to “wholy addict themselves” (29) to Christ, the church, and “the meaneynge of the scripture” (7). For Calvinists, in fact, addiction implies a state of grace. Addiction’s dark side appears there too—to condemn those (Catholics) who are “addict [sic] to their supersticyons” (7). Outside the church, early modern scholastic, legal, medical, political, historical, and lexicographical writers take up both sides of the issue, “wrestl[ing] with addiction”—as the book itself does—“in relation to devotion, compulsion, agency, and authority” (19) and weighing its advantages and dangers. To open up this extensive discourse, each chapter zeros in on a particular addictive drive and its representation in an early modern play: study in Doctor Faustus; melancholy and love in Twelfth Night; love and possession in Othello; and drinking and fellowship in Henry IV. If this compartmentalization leads to occasional repetition and confusion, it nonetheless shows how widespread and wide-ranging the preoccupation with addiction was in this period. A final, “methodologically distinct” chapter on “health drinking” in drama and poetry from 1580 to 1660 provides a slightly redundant recap as it picks up the opposition introduced in earlier chapters: the condemnation of addictive drinking as a form of enslavement, tyranny, and disease and the celebration of its potential to foster constancy, unity, and fellowship. Still, by surveying these volatile opinions across eighty years, Lemon is able to demonstrate how persistently the era’s “buoyant embrace” of addiction’s transformative power offsets the censure of its debilitating effects (139). Speaking of addiction in early modern drama is, of course, complicated by the fact that the words addict and addiction are far less prominent there than they are in the broader cultural discourse. As Lemon herself acknowledges, while The English Faust Book describes Faustus as “addicted,” in Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus the operative term is “ravish’d” (22, 36). And while a message from Othello invokes “addiction” to encourage the revelry that his troops might pursue after just having escaped a life-threatening tempest and encounter with the Turks (103), he deems his own addictive love for Desdemona a chosen “circumscription” (123) and for Iago, a “compulsive course” (131); Iago, in turn, describes him as “enfettered” (127). I would like to hear more about the implications of these shifts in nomenclature: (why) are characters [End Page 577] reluctant to name these habits as addictions? Still, despite the infrequent invocation of the word, the plays that Lemon addresses do feature the kind of “converting, transforming devotion” that cultural authorities celebrate and fear—giving her space to look at the “broader philosophical issues” that are their passion and their cue (54, 19).

      "title": "Leading with Heart: Building Connection through Unconditional Responsibility",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Medofer, Jessie | Advisor(s): Means, Charles | Abstract: I used to identify solely as the ultimate problem-solver, the person with all the answers. I sought safety in reason by avoiding the messy and uncontained aspects of my work. I engaged within a narrow scope of responsibility, and frequently felt frustrated, working in isolation as I faced adaptive challenges. As the Production Stage Manager of Vieux Carre, I pursued widening my responsibility and inviting connection. I shifted my approach to include sharing my curiosity and perceptions with an open heart. By prioritizing relationships, being vulnerable, and initiating difficult conversations, I cultivated trust and partnership. I supported a wholehearted process that expanded my informal authority with the company and kept me authentically engaged during our production’s toughest moments. In Vieux Carre, the character of the Writer moves between participating in scenes to observing them, while continually influencing the action and remaining responsible for the storytelling. He describes the cost of his work as being paid from the heart. In this sense, my work as a stage manager parallels the Writer as I both observe the process and step into the fray. Like the Writer’s unwavering commitment to the story, I have an unconditional responsibility for leading a collaborative process that is rooted in trust and authenticity. My choice to be vulnerable leads to genuine connection, which lays the foundation for strong partnerships and collaboration. By taking a wholehearted plunge into the work, I discovered that using my heart is not only nourishing, it is essential to my stage management style.",

      "title": "Abdulrazak Gurnah's Dottie: A Narrative of (Un)belonging",
      "abstract": "Having been educated in Tanzania, worked in Nigeria and migrated to England, Abdulrazak Gurnah has personally experienced ways in which conflict between exclusivist and eclectic concepts of racial identity galvanizes one's own life into new initiatives and responsibilities. In Gurnah's case, long exposure to outside influence has impressed a visible trace on novelist's way of structuring a narrative, for his originality is a response to other works from continent and echoes new directions taken by others in construction of spurious identities, which are neither here nor there. Gurnah's fidelity to his Asian-African roots, his liaison with inter-ethnic part of his soul, co-exists with constant unsettling of national and cultural notions of purity and authenticity, engendered by complex, hybridized of twenty-first century. As Edward Said has commented, Expatriation/exile for intellectual is restlessness, movement, constantly being unsettled and unsettling others. You cannot go back to some earlier and perhaps more stable condition of being at home; and, alas, you can never fully arrive, be at one with your new home or situation (365). The rootless nomadic traders of Gurnah's controversial novel, Paradise (1994), who exist in many languages, races and religions, as well as Dottie, a mixture of African, Punjab, English components, and Tanzanian emigre school teacher who eventually decides to go back to his country in Admiring Silence (1997), are symptomatic examples of this 'restlessness' and 'movement' and of author's experimentation with a changing reality observed from a continually de-centred and decentring position. In all his work, Gurnah demonstrates that the role of artist as expatriate is a complex network of commerce, experience and representation not as a passive witness but as vital actor and agent of modernity (Kaplan 47). In this sense, Gurnah's work is a dynamic site which lays bare paradoxes, incompatibilities and ambivalences that are central paradigms of migrant experience and discourse. The ways in which homeland and British environment are mediated and imagined through Dottie's selective strategies for constructing of an identity of her own gives reader fundamental insight into very nature of migrant discourse itself. Dottie (1990) is story of three siblings, Dottie, Sophie and Hudson, remnants of a poor family of ambiguously mixed origins. The central focus of novel is eldest sister Dottie, a factory worker born in Leeds, at outbreak of Second World War, whose real name is Dottie Badoura Fatma Balfour. Her ancestry, as her names suggest, goes back to Afghanistan, Punjab and Africa; her mother eventually settles in Britain where she becomes a low-life prostitute and alcoholic, and finally dies of gonorrhoea. The Balfours, therefore, are ruined heirs of imperialism, war, deracination and betrayal. They find themselves in England and literally do not know where they came from: their mother was a prostitute, called Bisiku, and they do not know their fathers. The central focus of Dottie is subject en process and its play of diverse shifting identities within larger framework of political upheavals of 1960s England. Race (here, read black) and gender (here, read female) are main stigmatized markers on practice/politics side of border, but they are not only markers, for they trade places in a fluid system in which differences of nationality, sexuality and class are interchangeable. Gurnah depicts a society in which access to power is determined by race, class and gender: in patriarchal society of his novel black woman is abused and relegated to sub-human. Gurnah not only describes acts of exploitation and violence perpetrated by individual men in private domain of home/family but also depicts analogous ones carried out by public institutions of medicine, university, law, and police. …",

My primary goal is to share insights with both new and experienced drivers about the surprising link between actions that seem safe when taken one at a time, and terrible surprises that you can expect will follow from repeated “safe” actions. The ideas run deeper than driving; they promise to help you to connect your decisions in the “now” with longer-term outcomes in your life. The insights about how rare events fuse together into high probability outcomes can help you to minimize costly unexpected surprises—and to raise the likelihood of achieving valuable outcomes that seem magical and serendipitous. Full mastery of the content makes use of some knowledge about probability, which you can learn from a mentor or via online materials. However, the key insights about the safety illusion (and it’s generalization, the single-action illusion) do not require probability. I hope you’ll make the investment in time and effort to understand the safety illusion, and then share the insights with your friends and family. They will likely find the ideas valuable and interesting—and perhaps surprising.",

      "abstract": "Emotion is central to our experience of others and of ourselves. Since the early 1950s it has come fully onto the agenda of psychology, and takes its place firmly alongside such functions as perception, memory, and thinking. A human emotion occurs typically when an inner concern is affected by an event in the outer world, usually about another person. Sometimes, of course, the inner concern meets an inner event, a thought, but the more frequent cause, a meeting of inner and outer makes emotion of special importance in psychology. The best current conception is that when a concern is affected by an outer or inner event, an emotion is the process that then gives urgency and priority to one goal or course of action and thought, while relegating others to a background for some period. Often the emotion has bodily accompaniments, some of which occur in readiness for the urgent action. Imagine you are crossing the road, holding the hand of a five-year-old child. A car screeches to a halt right beside you. You stop your road-crossing, grab the child, and jump back onto the curb. You look to make sure that the child is alright. Your heart thumps in your chest. You can’t help thinking about the implications of what has happened. The concern is for safety of the child and yourself. The event is being nearly run over. The emotion is fear. The urgent priority is to reach safety. Emotions of other kinds, too, typically involve patterns of action, bodily changes, and patterns of self-sustaining thought, which often are about our relationships with others. In our relationships, emotions of affection, of anxiety, and of conflict are fundamental to our social lives. Questions that have directed thinkers on emotions over the centuries include how the urgency, sometimes the seeming inexorability, of emotions might be modified, how individual lives are affected by emotions, and how friendships, families, and societies are shaped by them. Although emotions are psychological, their significance has become important also in psychiatry, sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, history, and literary study.",

We do not talk about suicide, and when we must talk about it, it is always problematic. Those whose job is telling a story end up experiencing these hardships. Looking at Ricoeur’s text, “La souffrance n’est pas douleur,” there is both the powerlessness of verbalizing and the powerlessness to act, and this is primarily confirmed by the very fact that the sufferer cannot escape his suffering. These two forms of powerlessness then become further forms of powerlessness: there is the impossibility of telling our own story; and finally, the impossibility of self-assessment, low self-esteem, guilt. Creating a hermeneutics of suicide, Bruzzone pushes the notions of voluntary and involuntary to the limit, problematizing what we believe and even what we may consider about existential decisions. What is particularly at stake in the Ricoeurian text concerns the sufferer who questions: why? why me? why my child?",

      "abstract": "Wang Guo\\|wei is a forerunner of introducing modern Western cultural thoughts. However, modern culture thoughts are not only the ideological issues, but also the practical ones of life which require the capacity and patience for individual beings to take on pressures. The identification with certain ideas is one thing, and to take on all the pressures of the ideas by individual life is the other thing. And, Wang Guo\\|wei hesitates before this inevitable requirement. Wang pays special attention to something in which the individual can find comfort. In his poinion, since it is impossible to find a real, complete detachment, one has to be content with the second best, that is, to find a temporary alleviation of grief, and a comfort. From the beginning, this way is different from the way to have the courage to take on pains and sufferings by oneself. And, it is the way to deal with pains in life which is connected with old\\|styled literati that Wang Guo\\|wei withdraws from the height and dynamics of thoughts, and from the strain of individual life. This paper traces and describes the course of Wang's withdrawal in the field of modern consciousness.",

Characters in these stories have lost daughters, sisters, mothers, and friends. Some characters go to extreme lengths to return to their loved ones—one woman hallucinates, another time travels. Others deal with the loss in more conventional ways, through support groups and the emotional outlet of community theatre. \nWhat ties these stories together is a sense of post-loss confusion and mystery. The characters are unsure how to move forward, or if they should try. The men and women in these stories struggle with faith as they navigate life after loss. They question who to have faith in. They wonder whether it is ever okay to let faith lapse. \nWhile attempting to answer these questions, the characters discover different questions. What are the connections between faith and loss? Faith and hope? Faith and forgiveness?",

Envy, jealousy, suspicious are traits that are currently often seen in social phenomena. 2022 as a year of moderation is considered a utopian ideal for some, and others are optimistic about achieving it. The problem is what causes us to be pessimistic or optimistic about achieving it? In this study, I use a reflective study to look at the basis of Indonesian human life by reflecting on the Encounter of Hinduism in Penghayatan Kebatinan in Javanese Culture. People who have been able to find the true essence in themselves then that person will get salvation. When people have found themselves, people will accept others. By being able to accept others, then the hope of tolerance can be realized. The life history of the Javanese is a witness to how the moderation movement as an embodiment of national dignity has become a basis that has been lived for a long time. The moderation movement is something that is far and away from Indonesia. From this narrative and writing, it can be seen that moderation is a form of dignity and the breath of national life. Openness to external elements without authenticity is a manifestation of the dignity of Life. The ideal of maintaining harmony is the basic philosophy of Javanese people in living life.",

Our cultural emphasis on autonomy and separateness has led to a retreat from valuing interpersonal, communal dependence and has greatly contributed to a rise in the number of people whose suffering is often expressed in addictions and personality disorders. Using actual patient material including diaries and letters, Karen Walant's Creating the Capacity for Attachment shows how 'immersive moments' in therapy-moments of complete understanding between patient and therapist-are powerful enough to dislodge the alienated, detached self from its hiding place and enable the individual to begin incorporating his or her inner core into his or her external, social self.",

Happiness for Ukrainians is to have their own fenced home, with a farm, with everything living and non-living that is there; to have a carefree life on one's own land; to live in harmony with the demands of one's own nature. Also to adequately perceive oneself and one's own capabilities. Those nations that are unable to adequately assess themselves are unhappy and therefore aggressive. Being aggressive extroverts, thay want to impose their own model of worldview on everyone else.

      "title": "Potholes in the Road to Devising",
      "abstract": "There is no art without resistance from the medium. —Raymond Chandler Every artistic process involves difficulty and risk, and devising has its own set of challenges. The playwright faces the problem of the blank page; with group devising, the problem is compounded by the number of opinions about how to fill it. Whether a particular collaborative process is based on harmony or on enthusiastic contention, there is no guarantee that the best ideas will emerge when the smoke has cleared or that the simultaneous contributions of numbers of people can unite in a work of power and vision. In the American nonprofit institutional theatre, devising is rare because it's risky and the outcome is so unsure. Development time must be financed and in the regional theatre there are severe limits on rehearsal time. Outside of existing ensembles that regularly devise their work, it seems that one-off devising collaborations among mature artists in the US are attempted infrequently or with great caution, since money, reputation, and visibility raise the stakes of devised work. The viewpoint of a mature artist may carry with it stronger opinions, less of a youthful \"let's see what happens\" attitude, and reluctance to compromise personal artistic ideals. Having devised and taught devising for many years, I bring to the topic broad personal experience with its difficulties as well as its joys. Devising generally takes us off the beaten path, where we may encounter ruts, potholes, mysterious cul-de-sacs, and wilderness areas. This essay describes some of those difficulties and offers tips for making the road less bumpy, the promised vistas more glorious. Ground Rules for Devising When collaborations are attempted, there is a greater chance of success if the group establishes and adheres to basic guidelines for working together. Collaborative principles encourage artists to develop trust and respect, come to a common understanding of the challenge, and to be clear about intention, roles, and agendas. By creating a shared space, generating and manipulating models, and using outside resources and strategies, the capacity for making decisions is expanded. Credos and manifestoes are often adopted at the beginning of a project as a way of hanging a banner of ideals and intentions. Writer Betty Comden recalls that when she, Adolph Green, Leonard Bernstein, and Jerome Robbins gathered [End Page 91] to devise On The Town in 1944, their first step was to make a credo: \"The work must have a unity, the songs must come out of the action, and nothing pretentious.\" Peter Buckley, a former Dell'Arte School Director, continually exhorted students to make agreements before starting to work.1 Sometimes, however, credos must be made midway in a collaborative process in order to head off physical violence. I know of more than one group of devisers whose partnership ended around a mediation table. Our own company sought out the services of a family counselor during our tenth anniversary production; we subsequently developed \"rules of civility\" for our future devising projects. The following Collaborators' Agreement was forged in 1994 by a quartet of theatre artists who came together to devise a new jazz opera based on a well-known classic theatre text. The composer, two playwrights, and the artistic director of the producing regional theater were mature artists with national reputations, the proposal had foundation funding, and it seemed like a dream project. Yet the stress of deadlines, lack of clear agreement over how the collaborative process might actually work, and aesthetic differences nearly scuttled the production. A rescue attempt was made through drafting the Collaborators' Agreement: We agree that we respect each other as artists and as people. We agree to show that respect in word and action. We agree that our intention is to help each other to do the best work possible. We agree that our intention is to support each other's creativity. We agree to respect each other's scheduled rehearsal time. We agree not to disturb each other's rehearsals. We agree to send messages and...",

      "abstract": "Abstract A writer is someone who writes. You have done it; you have expressed yourself on paper. Getting started is almost always picking up an old dream, an old desire. Getting started is usually getting started again. Frequently at writers’ conferences people ask what may seem to be irrelevant questions: What kind of pen do you use when you write? Do you write your first drafts on lined paper, or blank? Do you write at a typewriter or computer or with a pencil or fountain pen? Do you write in the daytime or at night? Actually, questions about the intimate details and habits of the writing life are not irrelevant; beginning or blocked writers know instinctively that these are important matters. They have to do with getting started, with keeping going. Each of us has idiosyncrasies, habits, and inclinations, and those peculiar traits are often linked closely to our creativity. Of course, what truly matters is not what works for the famous writer at the conference but rather what works for you.",

      "abstract": "This study's purpose was to understand further significant leadership crises create a very particular context for telling stories and, specifically, the lives of school leaders are affected by the stories they tell. The study presents the stories of seven private and public school leaders have experienced a serious conflict, dilemma, or critical event in their leadership practice that has in some way profoundly affected or wounded them. The study focused on school leader's identity to determine who in each case the person had become in the story, their story helped them to become that person and why. The methodology was ethnographic in that it required retrospective interviewing and narrative analysis. Findings suggest that the difficult experiences evoked stories that could be tentatively grouped by common themes. The storytellers chose a restitution story of how the problem was fixed which echoes the myth of principal as hero; a chaos story of near disaster that was notable by what was absent, that is a distressed telling without order or coherence and an uncertain future; or a story of quest, one that leads to a new or evolved story. All themes, however, are apt to be present at different times in each of the stories. Another finding relates to the particular ways in which participants were self conscious and aware of themselves as story makers and tellers, thus could become in a sense witnesses to their circumstances.

      "abstract": "Finding the WordsHow the Intersection of Asian American Studies and Women’s Studies Helps Me to Survive Kidney Cancer Jennifer A. Yee (bio) “Use your words.” How many parents of toddlers have resorted to this phrase when their barely verbal children scream, spit, hit, bite, wail, cry, and fling themselves onto the ground, beyond words? What is it like to feel deeply, have consciousness but not have the words to tell others how they can be of help, how they can love, support, keep one company, or, conversely, leave one alone? It is this type of silence that I have experienced as a person diagnosed and treated for kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma). It is an inability to express myself because the experience is too deep for words. It is a combination of physical, emotional, and psychological pain, surprise, anger, self-imposed social constraint, and plain lack of vocabulary. This silence is insidious and oppressive, rendering me wordless at a time of incredible vulnerability. I used the idiom beyond words to try to convey my experience of cancer to loved ones, friends, colleagues, and medical care providers. But beyond words was insufficient. I needed a vocabulary to convey what I felt and knew, not just for the sake of sharing with others, but to make sense of things for myself. When I began to heal from the physical trauma and treatment, but then move into healing from the emotional and psychological trauma, I realized that existing words and metaphors about the cancer experience could not help me to make meaning because they were laden with assumptions that do not reflect my own values, beliefs, and perspectives. Where could I find these words? I was falling through air, flailing, desperately grasping to find words to help myself understand, make meaning. In academia, we make our trade with language. Words are the foundation for our learning; our exchange of them: the basis for our teaching. Though scholars may debate whether thought precedes language or vice versa, there is no question that having, creating, and expressing ideas with words is the currency of our profession. [End Page 96] What happens, then, when there are no words? The absence of language to describe and make meaning of a human experience creates a peculiar type of silence. Because I incorporate a critical Asian/Pacific Islander American (apia) feminist approach into my academic work, I found myself turning to the language of my disciplines—higher education, Asian American studies, and women’s studies—to discern what was happening to me and why. purpose My purpose in writing is to contribute to the language and understanding of all, particularly women and people of color, negotiating life-threatening situations while seeking the healing to save their lives. In this autoethnographic essay, I offer a window into my experience as a person diagnosed with and treated for renal cell carcinoma. These stories, woven with various concepts used in the fields of Asian American studies and women’s studies, come from the first two years following my diagnosis. Using these narratives and conceptual meaning-making as a foundation, I recommend expanding the notion of what healing and recovery entail by proposing an emerging four-part theory of holistic healing. At first, I hesitated to write because I know that each person’s experience of a health challenge, including cancer, is unique. I’ve chosen to keep the language informal and include my “cancer humor”—which I hope I’ve had enough skill to convey as a coping mechanism of irreverent observation, irony, and self-deprecation, without disrespecting the seriousness of this potentially deadly disease. I also hope the combination of these stories, concepts, and expanded conceptualization of healing will contribute to a critically aware, feminist vocabulary and epistemology that people dealing with a serious health condition, especially women and people of color, can use to make sense of their own health-related and healing experiences. situating my self and my lens as a feminist of color As a faculty member in ethnic studies I am interested in working with others to build a foundation of theory on Asian/Pacific Islander American (apia), Asian American & Pacific Islander (aapi), and North...",

      "title": "Education, Person, Suffering. Reflections of Pain Pedagogy",
      "abstract": "Talking about suffering is not easy. It is a delicate and complex topic which involves, personally and deeply, each human being’s life through his/her personal distress, despair and, sometimes, even through annihilation: all the afore said places this topic in a sort of cultural form of exile. Suffering has almost become a taboo, even if it is more and more the object of show business nowadays and it is manifestly exhibited in public contexts. If, on the one hand, suffering plays a leading role in TV shows and it is the object of curiosity, on the other hand, far from the public eyes, it is put aside, even though it does not appear to be less thunderous. In the private sphere suffering is unsaid, denied, removed. Its exhibition has taken the place of its interpretation. Anyway, some worrying signals come from the new generations. The young people, in fact, seem to be incapable of going through and reacting to suffering, sometimes also to that suffering being the result of a little frustration, which is vented through exaggerated and unimaginable attitudes and behaviours. News in the mass media, meanwhile, already reports them almost on a daily basis. In this respect, what can pedagogy, and so education, do? Is it possible to hypothesize a pedagogy of the suffering as a specific ambit for reflection? And through what ways can education help the person to manage his/her suffering? This contribution aims to try to answer these questions.",

A person affected by pain may even begin to think and evaluate things differently. What is most important in the subjective experience of pain turns out inexpressible in language. The communication barrier which comes into being in such situations is responsible for the sense of loneliness the person affected by pain experiences: the suffering caused by pain becomes even deeper. The author first analyzes various types and aspects of the experience of pain in order to focus on the issue of the dissolution of the communication bond between the sufferer and his environment. He subsequently reflects on the conditions of the possibility of accepting pain in a situation of a new existential perspective being revealed to the suffering person and points that in certain cases accepting pain may lead to a liberation and a more valuable life.",

      "title": "PAIN, EXPERIENCE, AND WELL-BEING",
      "abstract": "IntroductionWe have all felt pain.We enter this world screaming, and we hope to leave it painlessly.In between, our lives are punctuated by moments of pain, often brief and negligible, a mere distraction, but at other times mind-blowingly intense and debilitating, stretching for hours, days, even months and years.Then there are unpleasant experiences such as nausea, an upset stomach, a numb foot or itching scalp, and other kinds of bodily discomfort.Not to mention heartache, bitter disappointment, loss, despair, depression, hopelessness…All lives contain suffering of this kind.This is not a matter of indifference.It barely matters, if it matters at all, how many green afterimages you have experienced in your life.But it matters a great deal how much pain you have had to endure.Pain is bad, and moreover, not bad in some purely impersonal way, as something that just makes the world itself worse, but bad in virtue of being bad for the person who has to suffer it.It makes the person's life worse, a little bit worse if the pain is weak and brief, a lot worse if it's awful and long.Long periods of intense pain can really blight a life.And when the pain is intense and unremitting, utterly pervading the end of a life or even an entire life, some would say that the pain makes the life not just bad but not worth living.It reduces well-being to such an extent, it is thought, that even non-existence is better than existence.It is important to distinguish pain's intrinsic badness-the way it makes a life worse by its very occurrence-from other harms that are often associated with pain, or caused by it.For example, physical pain is normally caused by bodily damage or dysfunction, states which are themselves often harmful.But, considered in itself, pain is just as bad when it is no longer associated with bodily damage-think of pain in a phantom limb, or pain caused by direct brain stimulation. 1 Strong, continuous pain can also cause further harms: the way it captures our attention can make it hard to think about anything else, and can therefore prevent us from pursuing our goals and projects.And pain can generate such an overwhelming desire to get rid of it that it often disturbs or even distorts our rationality, making us do what we judge to be deeply irrational or wrong-think of how a torturer can make his victim betray those dearest to him.These effects of intense pain add to its badness: they add further instrumental badness on top of its intrinsic badness.But again they should not be confused with pain's intrinsic badness.We can easily imagine a conscious state that is not aversive at all yet which completely captures our attention and disturbs rational choice.Such a state would have the same bad effects as intense pain yet not be in any way bad in itself.Conversely, someone who is just waiting to die, and no longer has any projects or goals to pursue (except, that is, that of dying with as little pain as possible) may still suffer greatly, and that suffering would be, considered in itself, just as bad for her.Pain, then, is intrinsically bad for the person who endures it.It gives that person selfinterested reasons to try to avoid, prevent, minimize and end that pain.And it gives others moral reasons to try to alleviate that person's pain, or otherwise feel compassion for her-not to mention stringent moral reasons not to cause others unnecessary suffering That pain is bad, and reduces our well-being is one of the few substantive ethical claims that command near universal consensus, that is accepted by nearly everyone.As we shall see below, even when pain is presented in a positive light, as something we should",

Telling our lived stories and listening to others’ stories are part of how we make sense of our lives and build our communities. It is no wonder that stories hold us in such thrall and have power in our relationships and organizations. Both listening to and telling stories are important skills for engineering educators and change agents at any career stage. Listening to the stories others tell provides an important glimpse into the values, beliefs, and assumptions made by those in the organization, and help us make sense of how our own stories fit into a given community. For example, a faculty member new to a department or a dean new to a college may be seeking allies to support an innovative curricular change; careful parsing of the stories told by others in the department or college may indicate who will be supportive and who is likely to only give lip service. Over time, changing the stories told, as well as telling new stories, shifts the assumptions of a group and how concepts turn into meaning.",

      "abstract": "[Extract] The artist's journey is a long one; it begins in a moment of wonderment, a moment of illumination – of seeing things through new eyes beyond accepted conventions. Somehow a light is ignited which burns inside the artist, propelling them to tell a story, express an idea, or search for resolution to an unanswered question. The true creative practice works against the safe path in order to discover new insights, yet achieving this is merely a glimpse of the possible and a re-kindling which drives the artist's oeuvre. For many artists the journey is started, but rarely does it become a career. There are no maps to the artistic journey; there is only the folly of seeking the unknown, of creating and innovating in an environment of no rules or regulations - the arts industry is a road lined with pot-holes and hazards, it is fickle in its training, ruthless in its networking, and is renowned for a lack of security or satisfaction. Perhaps artistic success is written only in the minds of those able to observe the artist's journey from the outside in, as success and failure often mirror each other in the artists' mind.",

      "title": "'Can We Meet? Talk? Love? Create Something Together?' - Conversations in Diva Research",
      "abstract": "Passing back and forth across multiple thresholds (conceptual, perceptual, emotional, somatic), a woman is falling through a thousand openings. Spaces enfold-unfold within her waiting. Muted, she is holding the weight of all sadnesses. Dissolving and resolving she falls too often, hesitates too long, clings too hard. She can neither return to her past nor escape its memories, inscribed as they are on/in her body/psyche. She forgets to breathe, is unable to breathe. Without breath, thought cannot become action. She is deflated. A returning inhalation creates the possibility of being articulated; it claims space inside her, makes audible the intimate kernel of diva voce, and she gives audience to herself. Once received she cannot un-know what she knows and is simultaneously liberated and made responsible: liberated from unconscious participation in self-limitation; responsible for unfolding towards her fullest expression. No Door On Her Mouth - a lyrical amputation is a work of dis/integration.No Door on her Mouth - a lyrical amputation is a concert (or recital) of breath, sound, movement and text for a solo woman performer, a diva. It is the performative culmination of the practice-led, arts-based doctoral research project in the academic field of contemporary performance that I undertook to investigate and reinvigorate the diva icon's usefulness to feminist theatre praxis.I am a contemporary performance scholar. In this paper I reflect on the ways that conversation emerged during my research process as a key methodological strategy for contemporary feminist performance-making. I use the word conversation here to refer both to actual conversations and to a form of reciprocal exchange that occurred in my interactions with texts, with a fluid and de-centered self, with critical theorists and with peers. My work has been underpinned by French feminist Luce Irigaray's reimagining of the pleasurable encounter between reader and text. Like Irigaray, throughout this study I have asked my community of minds and of practice, Who are you? And they have responded generously, And who are you? Can we meet? Talk? Love? Create something together? (Irigaray, 1991, p.149).Taking my cue from Irigaray, my thinking is reciprocal in that it questions, reacts and interacts with the other; is interested, after Australian philosopher Margaret Cameron (2008), in opening possibilities and delaying closure. As a methodological strategy, conversation requires expert practice to be able to notice its occurrence, allow its resonance, and examine its 'fruits'. Noticing its occurrence enables me as researcher to challenge the cautionary tale that to be a diva is to be a woman unhappily alone. Allowing its resonance enables me to theorise that to receive one's diva voce - one's material and metaphoric voice - is to discover oneself in the orchard of discourse, nourished by conversation. The reciprocity implicit in examining the fruits of the critical exchange between researcher and her community (of minds and of practice) has created a generous expansion of what it means to be a diva.I have chosen here to reflect on this methodological feature because this rich and juicy conversation, as a methodological tactic, could remain inaudible to the expert spectator who is not privy to the polyvocality of daily encounters that resound within and between the deliberate methods of a creative development and a practice-led performance enquiry. Hence in this paper I pay particular attention to the ways in which I noticed their occurrence. Amplifying a selection of conversations - (firstly, the conversation that followed a chance encounter between myself and a text; secondly, the conversation that occurred between my creative and critical selves through writing and other exercises; thirdly, the conversation that occurred with the pool of theorists in which I swim; and fourthly, the conversation between myself and my peers) - constitutes an act of fidelity and an act of resistance. …",

However, the Transition Cycle also represents the dynamics of every (brief) meeting in life on a micro level: every first meeting, every connection and every goodbye. The cyclical nature of the Transition Cycle represents the fact that after each loss, there is still potential for new-and even deeper-connections to be forged. There are many ways of working with the Transition Cycle. While standing there, clients are given the opportunity to go back to situations throughout life in which they had to deal with that particular theme by imagining situations in which that theme generated particularly strong feelings within them. The themes of the Transition Cycle are also present at a micro level in the moments of contact between counselor and client, from welcoming and forming attachments through sharing intimacy and saying goodbye.",

It gives us a superior feeling to announce that we must rid ourselves of stuffy thinking and cut our ties to an illogical past. It may be harder, and it is certainly less flashy, to approach novel situations with the assumption that the principles that have guided us in the past are still relevant, and that the practices and rules that apply to other materials and situations may also be applicable to this one. Concentrating on similarities, common interest, and shared principles may be less exciting than considering ourselves or our situation to be unique or unprecedented, but it is likely to yield more useful and lasting results.",

      "abstract": "If you listen to People are strange, a song by The Doors, you may hear in the\nlyrics allusion to the experience of being alienated. The Doors do this by\ncreating in their song, images of a stranger in the rain, perhaps rejected, and\ncertainly alone. The singer of this popular song is far away from home, where\nnobody knows his name. Perhaps the singer is a person with a communication disorder, experiencing the namelessness of aphasia, or the strangeness of\nstammering. Perhaps this stranger has acquired the communication disorder\nor maybe he has lived with it for a long time. Either way, this person seems\ndemoralized, alienated, lost, and depressed; and is experiencing a loss of\nidentity: perhaps not knowing who he is anymore. Perhaps his next song will\nbe a song leading him to voice his demoralization and to seek help from one\nof us. Perhaps one of us will not be a strange face in the rain; and we will be\nable to help this strange singer to ﬁnd his way home. The home of who he\nthought he was; who he had hoped he would become – but for the loss of his\nconnection through communication.",

      "abstract": "By its achievements and the transformations that would not have happened without it, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has always impressed me, as do the people who belong to it. And yet there is little structure, few rules, and no rush to judgment involved. It is a 'fellowship' rather than an organisation, and a society of peers (hence the anonymity) rather than a clash of personalities. Its success is attributed to the sharing of experiences, the moral support of the sponsors and the community, the strength and determination - rather than the weakness or the history - of its members, and the sense of hope it inspires and maintains in those who refuse to give up, one day at a time. To admit or acknowledge powerlessness over alcohol or any addiction is not to identify oneself as without all power. On the contrary, those who acknowledge weakness in one area and yet show determination succeed partly because of the power of the wider group and partly because of the power of their own personal dedication and perseverance. Members of AA know that they are only a day or a drink from disaster, and yet, curiously, this is their strength; by keeping that awareness clearly before them, they are unlikely to become arrogant or independent of a support group.",

Is meaning something to be discovered, perhaps like truth, or is it something to be chosen? And is meaning an impersonal thing, like gravity, or does it have to be imparted by an agent, like love? Meaning depends on the preparedness of the recipient. Objects can be a source of great pleasure. They can help bring meaning to our lives and contribute to our flourishing. But for most of us, once our basic material needs have been met, while objects can provide pleasure and be meaningful for us, it is relationships that are more important—and often longer-lasting. Many people find meaning in religion. This doesn’t mean that they don’t find it in anything else, but they find in religion the ultimate source of meaning.",

It is imbued with the value of a certain unconscious audacity, a kind of omnipotence born of naivety. As a hoarder as much as an archivist, I also find it all but impossible to discard my own earliest artworks and writings, anything I have completed that is made by my own hands and might be called my ‘juvenilia’, believing that these early works may contain treasures that are inaccessible to me now, and may deserve to be re-evaluated one day, by myself or some responsible and hopefully empathetic other. Even though my own professional status and influence is still not particularly high, I am convinced that these often inspired and unbound beginnings should not simply be regarded as the crude and tentative overtures of an oeuvre that became increasingly bold and refined, but should be simply seen as other and different works, arising at other and different (not better or worse) moments.",

      "abstract": "and ‘no’ very clearly, but most of the time she'd rather use her face to communicate, which is very expressive. But we've really nurtured the friendships and relationships that she's built throughout the year in class and, with that, she's become more confident to use her voice because there's no wrong sound. Any vocalisation she makes is brilliant. So, for example, it doesn't matter if it’s, at the beginning, if it's not a formed ‘please’. It can just be the ‘pl..’, the start, the initial sound or even a ‘mm’. It can just be the slightest sound. It's just encouraging her to use that voice. She’s very good at comprehending what you're saying and how to answer questions. So, because she does a split placement – she spends three days here and then two days in her mainstream setting – so we felt that she needed just that bit more support in communicating to give her that independence. So we set up the Tech/Talk for Sophia and she’s just flew with it. She asks to use it. She will tell us which template she wants. She regularly sits with me on the laptop and helps me come up with new templates and she will tell me what she wants on them, what she doesn't want on them. So for her review, we sat together and I just asked her, ‘What do you like about school?’ She told me. I said, ‘What don't you like?’ and she told me and so we had the child's view. My next step for Sophia is to get her to continue using her voice because sometimes she can rely on the Tech/Talk that bit more because it's a novelty. She enjoys it and so you do find that she'll stop using her voice to press the buttons, and so I don't want it to become her voice I want it to support her voice. But I see Sophia in the future using quite complex systems ‘cause, as she gets older, her language won't necessarily develop so much more so and she'll find that more frustrating as she gets... you know, as a teenager she'll want to be voicing her opinion that bit more. So I think a communication aid. I can really see her using quite a complex one.",

      "title": "'Chair Creaks, Though No One Sits there': Decomposition and Liquidity",
      "abstract": "How to describe and analyse a process from within, without self-aggrandisement, without exaggeration, yet engage a dispassionate listener? How to remember each small incident that influenced the outcome, and how to recall significant moments of revelation or realisation from the past, recent and distant, the pressure they may have exerted on the making of a single work? These are discursive notes, perhaps addressing the subject. The work may have begun in a room, though this seems unlikely. If it did begin in a room, then the room may have been quiet; if that were the case (which I'm inclined to accept for the sake of argument) then that quiet room was not just one room, because quiet rooms build up in your life: rooms within rooms within rooms, rooms in dreams, and now virtual myspace rooms and chat rooms. All these rooms were themselves enfolded within unfamiliar rooms that age barely remembers (or chooses to forget): those rooms of dread and pleasure, action and boredom, safety and danger. Their atmosphere accumulates, standing in relation to the feeling of being in rooms when something big was at stake: classroom, exam room, bedroom. 'Clocks spring to mind', I began to write (until realising that springing insinuates itself into the text as a pun, and puns are not my style, but clocks once defined the feeling of rooms): clocks ticking, measuring time, slowly, quietly, a presence, an interior atmosphere, dividing time with their chimes, then resuming their steady plod through ... what exactly? Each tick and tock seemed to freeze time, and if the clock stopped then the feeling of a room would change, dramatically. 'The worn voices of clocks repeated the fact of the hour all night long,' wrote Virginia Woolf in Jacob's Room. Indoor silence once was occupied, regulated and even articulated by a clock; it was not silence at all, of course, but the tick and the tock were paroxysms around which silence seemed to gather, like vultures round a corpse, waiting for the ungiven signal for decomposition. Now we have digital clocks, small battery operated clocks with a tick so fugitive that only paranoid listening in the middle of the night can search it out, and the visual noise but apparent audio silence of numerical displays on TVs, ovens, microwaves, computers and phones--so quiet rooms and the people within them now float within a more continuous and subliminal form of air. All of these devices radiate electromagnetic emissions, so their silence is illusory. With the right equipment, they materialise, just like the things of the air thronging H.P. Lovecraft's fiction. There are other small sounds; maybe they form wisps into solids, glue pieces into forms, keep people sane, or shield them from loneliness and the void. Georges Perec wrote about the man who stared at nothing, his radio playing at such low volume that no one really knew if he could hear it, yet when Madame Nochere went to switch it off, he stopped her. He listened to the hit parade every night: that was his claim. When I was a teenager, I listened to the hit parade at low volume, night, bedclothes, sleeping parents ... also indulging in melancholy, as is standard, and it being the 1960s, there was plenty of material to feed both needs. Poignant in its description of fragility, vulnerability, isolation bordering on chronic withdrawal, one of Brian Wilson's most revealing ballads, 'In My Room', described the bedroom as a world, a friend, a confidant, a refuge, an ear, a place of listening in which other people were absent. The lyrics, written by Gary Usher, were prophetic, since they anticipated Brian's notorious withdrawal into pyjamas--a bed-bound descent into the maelstrom of high calorie food, TV and cocaine that began in summer 1973 and ended in late 1975. Mark Rothko, also famously troubled, wrote interesting things about air. 'Tactile space, or for the sake of simplicity, let us call it air, which exists between objects or shapes in the picture, is painted so that it gives the impression of a solid,' he wrote. …",

      "abstract": "Eamonn, at 6, and Ruth, at 10, are sometimes hard to understand, as we saw when we met them in previous chapters (see chapters 6 and 12). They often produce words which the listener doesn't recognise. In full flow, they can leave the listener completely at sea with their meaning. On other occasions, their utterances are quite clear, but fragmented and lacking some of the forms that sentences demand. Where enough words can be recognised, the listener gets the gist of what they are saying, but may still be in the dark about certain details which we expect in language. The listener might gather who the children are talking about, what happened to them, but be confused about whether it has happened, may happen, or will happen. The listener may know they are asking something about an event, but not be sure whether they are asking who was involved, where it occurred, or when. Consequently, conversations with Eamonn and Ruth are not as smooth as with other children of their age: their conversational partners often find themselves confused or at cross purposes, and the conversation has to backtrack to get back on course. And yet these children are perceived as bright, on the ball, responsive and participating appropriately in conversations. Despite the considerable obstacles to communication, the gut feeling of the listener is that the meanings they have in mind are normal. What is the basis for that feeling? What is the evidence that they have access to the normal range and complexity of experience on which meaning is built, even if these are not reliably encoded in their language?",

It can also convince you that you are seeing what you want to see even when it isn’t there, leading you to believe in nonsense along the way. People employ Denial because it makes their life easier in the moment. It even makes it appear to be better, the way you would like it to be, the way you wish it was, rather than what it actually is. Denial reassures you, tells you not to worry, it’s not that bad, it could be worse. But the truth is, it is a short-sighted solution, a quick fix, a temporary Band-Aid. Am I Lying To Myself? helps readers squelch the tendency to let their own and others’ Denial rule their lives. This book takes readers through a series of real-world scenarios in which people find themselves mired in Denial. It will help you not only recognize Denial’s sneaky voice, but you will come away from each chapter with a useful skill that will help you address the Denial in your own life. After reading this book, it will become second nature to talk back to Denial with clarity and strength. This book will teach you how to do that. You will never lie to yourself again.",

      "title": "From Insight to Growth",
      "abstract": "This chapter proposes a model of how self-insight might lead to major life decisions that help cultivate personally meaningful growth. Several phenomena work together to facilitate the process of such changes, namely, crystallizations of desire and discontent, a quiet ego, narrative identity, and a transformative self. I view this model of insight to growth through the lens of narrative meaning-making and identity development. The process starts with insights regarding the broad trajectories of our life course, in terms of both what no longer works (i.e., a crystallization of discontent) and what one wants to do (i.e., a crystallization of desire). Inklings of such insights are commonly met with internal resistance before they crystallize, not least because they threaten existing ideals and commitments in our life story. To recognize these insights as constructive possibilities rather than as threats requires a quieted, less-defensive ego. But even if we are open to new possibilities, we still need to identify and interpret new life paths as workable – that is, as fitting within our notions of a meaningful, possible self over time. To do that, it helps to have a narrative identity that emphasizes themes of growth over safety, which is to say, a transformative self.",

      "title": "Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy",
      "abstract": "The field of couples therapy is undergoing a sea change. It is becoming more and more feasible to help a couple go from Wife: You are always the same—cold, distant, hostile—you are an emotional cripple—I have never felt so miserable. I should have left you years ago, and if you don't smarten up I'll do it. Husband: You are so difficult to live with—maybe we would be better apart. All we do is fight. I don't see the point. to Husband: I do shut down—I am so devastated when you get so angry with me—me—the Big Disappointment. I want you to stop hammering me so I can come out of my shell and we can be close again. I don't want to lose you. Please don't tell me that you are leaving. Wife: I just get so scared—so I need your reassurance that you do love me—even if we get stuck in these fights. It's hard for me to admit how much I need you, but I'm not leaving. I want us to be together. The context for the transformation in couples therapy is the recent expansion of what might be called the \"science of everyday life.\" The couples therapist can now refer to a body of literature on key variables such as the nature and significance of emotion (Ekman 2003), the nature of marital distress and satisfaction (Gottman 1994), and most significantly, the nature of adult love (Johnson 2003). As long as love was viewed as a random and mysterious process, it was almost impossible for couples therapy to evolve into a viable discipline that might successfully address the quality of couple relationships. Indeed, this therapy modality has often been accused of being simply a set of techniques in search of a theory. It has also traditionally been very much on the sidelines of psychotherapy, the key players being individual therapy and family therapy. Family therapists have always acknowledged that the couple relationship is the foundation of the family but have focused on parent–child interactions. Individual therapists focusing on intrapsychic variables most often miss the power of the client's present interpersonal context and how this context continually defines the self and shapes affect regulation strategies. But now, at last, it is possible to ground couple intervention on a scientific basis so that it may become a powerful discipline in its own right. In fact, it is fast evolving into a major mental health intervention with the potential not only to heal our most precious relationships but to create relationships that heal. Emotionally focused couples therapy (EFT) is at the forefront of this new discipline.",

      "title": "The Wairua of Self: A Path of Love, Simplicity, and Connectedness",
      "abstract": "Love is an action of freedom until something else steps in – often fear – that insists we create a box of survival. Whether self-imposed, forced, or chosen, it is interesting to notice how we limit ourselves with love. This thesis examines love; love in its purest intent and creation as the simplest way to live. An analysis of personal experiences, illuminated by psychological, mythological, philosophical, and spiritual literature, suggests that living from a place of love can be accomplished through a dedicated journeying back to the Self. The Māori myth of Tāne-Mahuta and Hine-Tītama shows the significance of releasing shame, as well as how a tragic situation might offer a catalytic possibility that shifts a core belief about one‘s self. The complications of love that are self-created through loss and grief can easily mask the barely underlying truth of love in its nakedness. Reconnecting with this underlying truth, aroha in its purest sense, is essential for healing and allows for increased connection with the Divine. Doing so is often a difficult task, as hypocrisies fueled by fear and perpetuated by blame are bountiful. When love is used as an instrument and convenience in order to defend a closely held idea, person, or way of life, one often moves further from their true Self, thus surrendering their deepest power and knowing of love. The silent assault of expectations, power, will, and control can turn love into a complication. The complications of being utterly human only serve to further obscure love. Within families, how one initially learns love is often complicated by interrupted attachment, causing rebellion and the need to look for love elsewhere. The components of Tikkun Olam, aroha, mikveh, and wairua of spirit, are intertwined and interconnected, such that the delineation between cultures and spiritual beliefs cannot be divided as oppositional forces. The denominator lives in the magnitude of love for all that has been created; beginning with the Self. In setting the foundation of self-love and allowing it to settle into the fractures and rifts of porousness, love may then be extended without attachment. When freely proffered without agenda, love will seep into every curve of the universe; thus, changing the world. Through the practice of mindfulness and lovingkindness, perception can change. It is this change in perception which can return love to its origin of simplicity. This thesis is a story of love.",

      "abstract": "Of the many memoirs of parents published in North America since the early 1990s, the great majority concern fathers rather than mothers. This pattern reflects the relational dynamics of the post-war middle-class nuclear family, typified by an absent bread-earning father and an available home-making mother. Memoirs of fathers (patriographies) tend to emerge from relationships that were experienced (by the writers) as deficient in some way or other. The books are best read not as static representations of fathers (i.e., biographies), whether favourable or not, but rather as attempts to claim or even fashion a relationship with a father who is absent—because of death, geographical distance, or emotional reserve. A significant number have to do with fathers who were creative intellectuals—writers, artists, and so on. In such cases, the child often has a fraught relationship to the father's body of work. For one thing, the father's creative work is what removes him from the house or sequesters him within it. Moreover, insofar as the father's intellectual labour produces a species of progeny, it may provoke a kind of virtual sibling rivalry. Furthermore, the work is generally available to a wider public, with whom the child may feel competitive. The writing of the memoir often attempts to renegotiate the parent-child relationship, in part by establishing a new relationship to the father's body of work.",

It results from bereavement and, because people can anticipate a loss, it can precede it; we then term it Anticipatory Grief. Mourning is the public face of grief, the way in which people behave after bereavement. Clearly religious faith is a complex thing and we should not be surprised at the results of research which seldom show that people who subscribe to a particular religion are therefore less vulnerable to bereavement than others. Grief is part of the range of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that attach people to each other and are found in all social animals. In the early stages of bereavement people tend to swing back and forth between the so-called pangs of grief and attempts to put grief aside and get on with the many tasks that face them.",

We must reckon with such a possibility, and there is absolutely nothing dreadful to us in the fact that the bourgeoisie might succeed in this. Communism 'springs up' from Positively all sides of social life, its sprouts are everywhere, without exception-the 'contagion' (to use the favourite and 'pleasantest' comparison of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois police) has very thoroughly penetrated into the organism and has totally impregnated it. If one of the 'vents' were to be stopped up with special care, 'contagion' would find another, sometimes most unexpected. Life will assert itself. Let the bourgeoisie rave, let it work itself into a frenzy, commit stupidities, take vengeance in advance on the Bolsheviks, and endeavour to exterminate in India, Hungary, Germany, etc., more hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of the Bolsheviks of yesterday or those of tomorrow. Acting thus, the bourgeoisie acts as did all classes condemned to death by history. The Communists must know that the future at any rate is theirs; therefore we can and must unite the intensest passion in the great revolutionary struggle with the coolest and soberest calculations of the mad ravings of the bourgeoisie....

Some had left their toxic job and were surprised they did not have the sense of relief they expected. Like those considering leaving, they grappled with the sense of loss from the parts of the work they had enjoyed. For some, the bully had been removed from the organisation. Unfortunately, the lack of acknowledgement of the damage caused and the lack of support for those affected left them feeling unable to move forward as they had hoped. Others were still involved in ongoing attempts to seek resolution and felt tired and devastated. Most champions considered themselves changed people and were less trusting of colleagues and managers. Most champions felt unable to forgive the bullies and the system that allowed the bullying to perpetuate.",

      "title": "Deafness as Conflict and Conflict Component",
      "abstract": "Deafness as Conflict and Conflict Component Christopher Jon Heuer (bio) Writers of D/deaf autobiographies or biographies face something of a dilemma when incorporating deafness into the stories they tell. This includes writers of D/deaf fiction because many such works are based on the same personal experiences from which autobiographies and biographies are derived. At heart, autobiographies and biographies are merely stories, and stories cannot exist without some type of conflict. The tension might be complex or simple: a crisis of identity or a fight to keep a residential school open. It might be found in a decision to move from one state to another or in a collapsing marriage. Because D/deaf autobiographies and biographies are in some sense about deafness and because no autobiography or biography can ever be complete unless it captures the discord inherent in the subject's life, several questions arise: What is the fundamental relationship between deafness and conflict? As we approach the task of relating and reliving the tensions of a D/deaf life through the craft of storytelling, does deafness become the central conflict, or does deafness instead become merely one component of it? Or does it perhaps become some mixture of the two? One of my own autobiographical fiction projects involves the life story of Daniel Tallerman, a hard-of-hearing teenager struggling to survive the abuses of a violent alcoholic father, as well as those of both the hearing and the Deaf communities.1 The mistreatment he endures, along with the identity conflicts he experiences from being [End Page 195] repeatedly placed in and pulled out of mainstream schools and deaf institutions, slowly brings on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Daniel Tallerman's experiences are at least somewhat autobiographical in the sense that they happened to me, but they are also fictional in the sense that events that happened far apart were moved closer together for the sake of drama. In addition, Daniel's character and encounters are molded from and completed by the real-life experiences of my siblings and friends. For example, in the short story \"On the Bottom,\" Daniel has an older brother named Wayne, who has a cognitive disability. My own older brother, Steven, also has a cognitive disability. As another example, the short story \"Listening for the Same Thing\" largely revolves around Daniel's relationship with his girlfriend, Jenny. The character of Jenny is based upon an actual person whom I dated in my early teens. I mention these facts only to illustrate that autobiography and biography are capable of working their way into fiction, and vice versa. The question of how deafness relates to conflict is one that stretches across genres, and its implications are at once fundamental and unavoidable. Neither autobiography nor biography nor fiction can survive without discord. Without it, we are left with boredom. Without it, what we have is the lack of a point, a theme, and a plot. Human beings, whether deaf or hearing, are motivated to do the things they do. Through an analysis of motivation, we come to an understanding of character (in autobiography, biography, and fiction). By examining how the motivations of one character interfere with those of another, or how competing motivations collide, we come to an understanding of conflict. Conflict is not just a clash between people, as would immediately appear to be the case in Daniel's life. His father not only is an alcoholic who alternately abuses Daniel and neglects him but also makes fumbling, dismal attempts to be a father. His mother exists in a state of perpetual denial. He is buffeted between the worlds of Deaf people and hearing people, anxious to escape the torment of his home life at the residential institution he attends. Yet his deaf schoolmates constantly pick fights with him because he cannot sign. He frequently misses Jenny while he is away at school, but when he visits her on weekends, hearing teenagers mock him and antagonize him because he is deaf. [End Page 196] If these are examples of conflicts between people, they are also examples of conflicts within people. Why is Daniel's father an alcoholic? We don't know, but we are given...",

I had to explain the difference between having a permanent contract and a lifetime guarantee of work. The delusion of safety of employment has truly been bred out of us, along with expectations of social and employment protections, pensions, training or career progression. This de-regulation of working life is directly linked to a de-regulation of our internal lives. With the loss of work security, we are likely to experience an internal insecurity, and along with it fear, anger and a recurring sense of uselessness. This is hard to manage at the best of times, but in the face of unemployment it is hard to self-regulate. Under enough pressure we lose our perspective and capacity to think past these overwhelming feelings.",

      "abstract": "The identity of an animated character means who he really is, or what are the characteristics that would never change? How the character sees himself and how others see him? It includes shape, color, race, beliefs, and choices in life. \r\nThe more the storyteller gives identity to his animated character, the more it is sound and convincing. In that sense, it touches the audiences’ hearts as they feel its pain or happiness. In other words, they are involved in the story and united with the character. \r\nAs the story begins, characters and settings are presented before the audience to get an overview of the characters’ identity. Then, more elements are to show up, like the conflict, the problem that needs to be solved and the rising actions, which are series of events that lead to the high main point or the climax. It is considered as a turning point of the story after which the falling actions come. The falling actions are events and complications that start to loosen the plot. Gradually, the solution shows up as the story ends either happily or tragically. \r\nThroughout the storyline, these groups of events that form the story sometimes account for the appearance of an identity crisis that impacts the character. It means that he is uncertain of his feelings about himself; he gets confused about what type of person he is or what is the true purpose of his life. It always takes making an existential that plays a big role in the storyline. \r\nThe identity crises appear in Toy Story 1995 to Buzz light-year when he discovers the truth of himself; that he is a toy, not a space ranger as he thought before. This made him give up hope of returning anywhere. It took him sometime to accept the fact of himself after seeing how Woody struggles to return them both to Andy. He tries his best to save his friend and return home safely, as being dictated by the role’s vision. \r\nIn Toy Story 2 1999, the identity crises appear to Woody when Buzz strikes him with the fact that he is not a collector’s item. He is a child’s play thing, he is a toy. Then, a decision has to be made to return to Andy, and the struggles start with the Prospector. \r\nIn Toy Story 3, 2010, the identity crises appear to Woody at the end of the story. He was suffering to be away from all his toy family that will be left in the attic, so he wrote on the box to be donated and he attached himself in, with them hoping that Andy gives him a very warm goodbye and leaves him with the rest of the toys in good hands. \r\nIn Finding Nemo 2003, the identity crises for Nemo is when he chooses to touch the boat, even though it is a dangerous thing, just to prove to his father and his friends that he is brave. It led him to fall in the capture and to meet other fish Gill in.",

Dostoevsky is necessary for those who constantly see the perspective of their own death, and not for those who try by all means to shield themselves from it, even when death is drawing nearer. He is necessary for those who look for the sense of experience in every circumstance of life, for those who understood the difference between the aims of life and the circumstances in which it is lived (comfort or misery, social inclusion or exclusion, etc.). Dostoevsky’s greatest gift to those who can and want to accept it is the idea that got into him after the unfulfilled execution: the main goal for people on earth is to remain human in every circumstance, constantly becoming a bit more human, overcoming obstacles to this both inside and outside the self.",

      "abstract": "Working as an expert witness is rewarding.However, precisely because it requires delving into the applicant's experience of persecution and torture, it can also be stressful and take an emotional toll on the witness, as it does on the applicant and the attorneys.For more than thirty-two years, I have worked as a legal service provider with asylum seekers.Secondary trauma and vicarious trauma, long identified as occupational hazards for those working in victim and emergency services, can affect legal service providers who work directly with asylum seekers. 1 Over the years, I have listened to harrowing stories from many applicants who have fled their homes, and witnessing their pain in the retelling of their stories remains with me.To prepare their cases, I must ask questions that force them to relive their traumatic experiences, and I have witnessed their flashbacks and other reactions.The human spirit can be battered by a single act or multiple acts of violence against bodily integrity, as well as extreme mental cruelty and torture, by an individual actor or government-sanctioned actors.Those most harmed are resilient and some of the bravest people I have ever met, as are the attorneys who support their asylum claims and therefore vicariously experience the suffering these migrants have had to endure.After many years, the legal profession has finally begun to recognize and address the secondary trauma that so many immigration attorneys regularly experience.This chapter outlines the issues that an expert witness may encounter while working with legal service providers on asylum cases.It provides suggestions for self-care and assistance to address concerns that may arise. 2",

      "abstract": "Dead or as good as dead.’ Not so long ago articles and essays on privacy often started with a statement like this one. Unfortunately, those announcing the end of privacy often did not indicate what exactly was going on. Is our privacy indeed coming to an end? Can we no longer hide things from the eyes of our all-seeing neighbors, companies, and public bodies? Or perhaps nobody, including pro-privacy advocates, is really convinced of the value of privacy? As far as the recognition of the importance of privacy is concerned, there seems to be no justification for pessimism. In spite of the prognosed lack of vitality, privacy presently leads a remarkably lively existence in newspaper opinion columns and in public debate.",

      "title": "Terrible Sanity",
      "abstract": "Terrible Sanity Sam Pickering (bio) The price of living dutifully and responsibly is high, often costing life itself. Days devoid of madness are often terrible, desolate, and in their sanity truly mad. At my age a person scrolls back through his decades and ponders the innumerable occasions on which he betrayed himself in order to be true to others or true to the expectations of others. However, Time salves, and the regrets one fancies he feels rarely inflame and are always fleeting. In assessing what his months at Walden Pond taught him, Thoreau said he learned \"that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.\" The old are not susceptible to seborrheic optimism. Dreams don't determine the direction I'm traveling although if my druthers were answered I'd like to slip back into dust quickly and painlessly. Of course, dreams sometimes break my sleep. In them, celestial cities surrounded by jasper walls never appear. Occasionally, the dreams are mad, compensating perhaps for my having lived placidly and rationally. Last week I dreamed I owned a small home-furnishings store. I specialized in selling blood-stained floorboards. My clientele [End Page 103] were the jaded wealthy for whom exotic pleasure had lost its savor. They purchased the boards as conversation pieces and fitted them into parquet floors, generally in foyers but sometimes in libraries and music rooms. The most expensive boards were associated with notorious murders, the cheapest domestic abuse. I also sold blood-stained comforters and sheets. The more intricate the pattern of spillage the higher the price. Mounted behind clear glass, these served as wall hangings. They were especially popular with postmodern mothers keen to adorn their progeny's playrooms with \"decorations more emotionally stimulating than Mary Poppins or Winnie the Pooh wallpaper.\" No longer do I ask \"what's the news\" or speculate about what the news will be. Instead I ponder \"what was the news?\" In part I do so because washing old news is easy, whereas the unscrubbed present settles on the skin and clogs pores. The hagiography evoked by the death of President George Bush was, for example, macabre and underbred—Egyptian in its pyramidical vulgarity. How repellent, to Fed Ex his shell back and forth across the country to be gabbled over by the political class. He deserved a quick, decorous burial in Texas, refined and soothingly proper, muted recognition attesting to his common humanity. The truth is that I am not comfortable in every minute of the present hour. When a stranger addresses me and says, \"Have a blessed day,\" the words are as unpleasant to my ears as a crop duster is to the nose. No long-term wife is a cloister unto herself. Unable to retreat into a verbal nunnery, Vicki has been tainted by my linguistic distastes. Last month after hearing an announcer on National Public Radio say \"irregardless\" three times in fifty-one minutes, she telephoned the station in Amherst, Massachusetts. \"Curdling illiteracy does not go well with breakfast,\" she said, urging the woman who answered her call to inform the announcer that regardless was standard English. I react stronger than Vicki to the insignificant, especially lardy uplift. In December during examinations, signs appeared atop the circulation desk in the university library. The signs were modest, only eight by ten inches. One morning a sign simply said, \"You Can.\" Underneath the [End Page 104] words appeared a bloodless Valentine heart. The next day, \"Eat, Sleep, Breathe. Good Luck\" replaced \"You Can,\" and the heart became a Rosetta Stone of emoji: a five-pointed star, an empty circle, a smiley face with a curl swinging across the forehead like a pendulum, something akin to a croquet mallet, and then another something resembling a mitten with the thumb jutting out as if the wearer were hitching a ride. \"Such signs should say, 'Study. Only Nitwits Rely on Luck,' 'You Can't If You Don't Work Your Ass Off,' and 'Distinguish Yourself from the Lazy Herd and Make Your Fee-Paying Parents Proud,'\" my friend Josh said to...",

The author argues that responsible self-disclosure, that carefully considers \"what, to whom, and for what purpose,\" is a mark of maturity, and needs to be validated and respected even in the context of psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Fostering Innovation",
      "abstract": "While innovation can be defined in many ways, the author sees it as a process. It is not the sudden eureka moment in the middle of the night, nor is it a clear and linear path towards a final destination. Instead, it involves a strong sense of creativity and curiosity. An innovative mind has a natural inclination towards out-of-the-box thinking. It involves a willingness to try something new, without fear or judgment, to develop something no one else has ever articulated. While the mindset comes naturally, it requires fuel to keep it running. Innovators are voracious readers and researchers. They feed their mindset all of the fuel it needs to stay informed and relevant in their field. Many of the same things can be said for the Lean mindset. Lean management doesn’t happen overnight, and it is very rarely a clear and linear path to true Lean thinking. Some might consider Lean a subset of innovative thinking, while others see it in reverse. Regardless of the relationship’s directionality, one thing is certain: You cannot have one without the other. This book follows John Riley, the CEO of a medium-sized valve company just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who will stop at nothing to create an innovative work environment. Through the ups and downs of his journey, he learns a number of Lean and innovative skills, strategies, and mindsets to help him build the business he’s always envisioned for himself. Throughout the book, you see examples of both strong and poor innovative leadership skills demonstrated by each of the main characters. The key messages are ones that help leaders build and access a mindset insistent on continuous improvement. Leadership techniques and abilities that bolster creative thought and problem-solving are the most successful throughout this book. To be truly innovative, you can never stop driving the learning process. For this to happen, leaders need to recognize when there is a need for a change or improvement. This is the beauty of the marriage between Lean and innovation: They both require continuous learning and growth. The desire to improve is only one piece of this equation, however. The other is the willingness to act. Without both of these factors, true innovation will always be out of reach.",

Those of us who work with the adolescent—whether at school, at a youth club, in the doctor's surgery, or in an institution—are certainly aware of how vital our relationship to the adolescent may be. But, in spite of this, we are also prone to finding ways of explaining away the presence of serious signs of existing or impending trouble, with the hope that the adolescent will grow out of it, or with the belief that it might be more constructive to let things be rather than to create a crisis. At the same time, we all know that mental breakdown, and certainly mental illness, is a dreadful human tragedy that frightens all of us. But our present knowledge of the mind does enable us to say that many severe mental disorders and breakdowns can be prevented if we act early enough and if that 76action is based on the belief that mental breakdown does not come from out of the blue, but that it has a very specific meaning in the person's life.",

      "title": "Risk",
      "abstract": "There is freedom waiting for you, On the breezes of the sky, And you ask “What if I fall?” Oh but my darling, What if you fly? Erin Hanson A risk is an unwanted negative event which may or may not occur. The level of risk depends on the likelihood and severity of the harmful consequences. Why do we take risks at all? We take risks because there are advantages if the risk pays off. We take risks if we judge the benefits justify the potential harms. You cannot fall in love without risking a broken heart. You cannot give birth without putting yourself at risk. You cannot raise a child without the risk that the child might die before you do, but to decide not to have children is to miss out on what can be one of life's greatest joys. Contemporary parents are older than in the past and are increasingly risk-averse on behalf of their children. Where previously children often walked or took the bus, many of us now drive our children to school, thereby protecting them from the slightest risk of harm, while decreasing socialisation with their peers and increasing their risk of obesity. Of course we should protect our toddlers with pool fences, curb our children's most perilous behaviours, and reduce the risk of severe injury through insisting on bicycle helmets, but over-protection inhibits independence. Learning about risk is an essential part of child development (Fig. 1). There is a biological aspect to risk-taking. We all know that adolescent males take more risks than adolescent females. Young males are more likely than young females to die from accidents or conflicts. Psychologist Bill von Hippel explains that this is not mere stupidity; there is an evolutionary reproductive advantage to young males' risk-taking behaviour.1 Men have greater variability in reproductive success than women, who do not need to take such risks. Risk-taking indicates quality to a potential female partner: for a male to do something risky and succeed shows skill, to take a risk and fail but survive shows resilience, and if you do not survive, well that is evolution at work too.1 To test the basis of male risk-taking, von Hippel's PhD student devised a social experiment involving skateboarders.2 A male researcher asked a skateboarder if he could film him making 10 attempts at a new trick. Then the same skateboarder was approached by either a male or an attractive female researcher who asked if they could film the same trick 10 times. After the second round each skateboarder gave a saliva sample to be tested for testosterone. Testosterone levels were higher in the presence of the female researcher, while the higher the testosterone level the more risks were taken. Those who took most risks crashed more often but landed more tricks. They also declined a prior offer of knee and elbow pads and crash helmet: injuries and spilt blood were a badge of honour.2 As von Hippel points out, we are unlikely to persuade young men not to take risks: ‘Young men feel millions of years of evolutionary pressure, emanating from their testicles, pushing them towards risk and competition’.1 The biological explanation accounts for young men's risk-taking behaviour, but in health care why would any of us, male or female, ever take risks with people's health? Because some risk is inevitable. Every day in medical practice we expose others to risk, specifically the assessment of what to treat, whether to treat, how to treat and the burdens as well as the benefits of any treatment. We know that both medical3 and surgical4 patients fare better when treated by a female rather than a male physician, although we do not know if this is because female physicians take fewer risks or are superior to males technically. Trying to avoid all risk to a patient, however, may actually be deleterious. Clinicians order countless invasive tests for fear of litigation, but a patient who is subjected to innumerable invasive tests to avoid missing an unlikely diagnosis may be at more risk of harm from the tests than the illness.5, 6 There are also financial and organisational risks to the health-care system from over-investigation. We are not very tolerant of risk in health care. Health-care association accreditation requires meeting National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards.7 The recommended risk management approach to prevent and control infection divides risk into low, medium, high, very high and extreme. Low risk should be managed by routine procedures, medium risk by specific monitoring or audit, but whether the risk is high, very high or extreme we are told: ‘This is serious and must be addressed immediately’.7 One wonders why it is necessary to have three categories of high risk when they all have to be dealt with immediately. Of course patients should not be put at preventable and unnecessary risk, especially when there is a rational basis to risk prevention or reduction based on good evidence. But the increasingly extreme risk-averse approach being adopted by many health departments runs the risk of burgeoning bureaucracy while stifling any staff initiative. There seems to be a form to fill in for almost everything. Red tape has replaced flexibility and common sense. Innovation almost always involves a degree of risk. To allow innovation, we may need to take a less rigid approach to risk: risk reduction may be less constricting than risk avoidance. As Mark Twain wrote: ‘Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover’. Take a risk.

      "title": "Small voices: hidden diversity in prisonspast and present.",
      "abstract": "Editorial comment: At a time when public and political\r\ndiscourse seems to be dominated by\r\ninexorable simplification and the\r\nimposition of compassionless\r\nhomogeneity, small voices are needed.\r\nSmall voices can provide a check on\r\nunreflective generalisations - about\r\nindividuals, groups or behaviours - that\r\nseldom seek causes, justifications or\r\ndeeper understanding. Small voices\r\nhighlight diversity of circumstances and\r\nexperience, impact and consequences.\r\nThey are complex and difficult, but raise\r\nthe bar on what might be required to\r\naddress social problems and injustices. The\r\nadjective of small reflects not only the\r\ndifficulties of these voices emerging,\r\ngetting out beyond their own immediate\r\nspace or confinement, but the multiple\r\nobstacles which prevent them being\r\nlistened to and acted upon. Historically,\r\nindividuals or groups who had such small\r\nvoices may not have been able to leave\r\nrecords or their records were not\r\nconsidered significant enough to be\r\npreserved. For those historians committed\r\nto social history, revealing a history from\r\nbelow, the recurrent problem is the dearth\r\nof materials produced and preserved by\r\nthose most marginalised and, thus, the\r\nperennial reliance upon sources which may\r\nrelate to those with small voices but which\r\nactually derive from, and are shaped by,\r\nthose with greater influence and volume.\r\nThis problem may take a different shape in\r\nthe early twenty-first century but has a\r\nsimilar outcome. Even though new\r\ntechnologies and forums make it possible\r\nfor small voices to be more easily relayed,\r\nthey often remain mediated, overwhelmed\r\nor silenced by noisier, dominant speech. In\r\nsuch circumstances, small voices require\r\nothers with influence, networks and\r\nvolume to enable them to emerge, be\r\nheard and listened to. With this in mind,\r\nthe contributors to this edition endeavour\r\nto capture and reveal small, often unheard,\r\nvoices within the prison system, past and\r\npresent. Their aim is to utilise these voices\r\nto highlight broader struggles and\r\ninjustices that can all too easily go\r\n3 / 6\r\nunnoticed and, in doing so, emphasise the\r\nextent to which structural factors\r\ndetermine that some groups will\r\ndifferentially experience the criminal\r\njustice system and incarceration.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In this and the following chapters the expressions exhibited by man under various states of the mind will be described and explained, as far as lies in my power. My observations will be arranged according to the order which I have found the most convenient; and this will generally lead to opposite emotions and sensations succeeding each other. Suffering of the body and mind: weeping. I have already described in sufficient detail, in the third chapter, the signs of extreme pain, as shown by screams or groans, with the writhing of the whole body and the teeth clenched or ground together. These signs are often accompanied or followed by profuse sweating, pallor, trembling, utter prostration, or faintness. No suffering is greater than that from extreme fear or horror, but here a distinct emotion comes into play, and will be elsewhere considered. Prolonged suffering, especially of the mind, passes into low spirits, grief, dejection, and despair, and these states will be the subject of the following chapter. Here I shall almost confine myself to weeping or crying, more especially in children.",

      "title": "Robert Greene: A Process for Finding &amp; Achieving Your Unique Purpose",
      "abstract": "Life is endless battle and conflict, and you cannot fight effectively unless you can identify your enemies. Learn to smoke out your enemies, to spot them by the signs and patterns that reveal hostility. Then, once you have them in your sights, inwardly declare war. Your enemies can fill you with purpose and direction. BLITZKRIEG STRATEGYIn a world in which many people are indecisive and overly cautious, the use of speed will bring you untold power.Striking first, before your opponents have time to think or prepare, will make them emotional, unbalanced, and prone to error. CONTROL THE DYNAMIC: FORCING STRATEGIES People are constantly struggling to control you. The only way to get the upper hand is to make your play for control more intelligent and insidious. Instead of trying to dominate the other side's every move, work to define the nature of the relationship itself. Maneuver to control your opponents' minds, pushing their emotional buttons and compelling them to make mistakes. HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS: THE CENTER-OF-GRAVITY STRATEGY Everyone has a source of power on which he or she depends. When you look at your rivals, search below the surface for that source, the center of gravity that holds the entire structure together. Hitting them there will inflict disproportionate pain. Find what the other side most cherishes and protects-that is where you must strike. DEFEAT THEM IN DETAIL: THE DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER STRATEGY Never be intimidated by your enemy's appearance. Instead, look at the parts that make up the whole. By separating the parts, sowing dissension and division, you can bring down even the most formidable foe. When you are facing troubles or enemies, turn a large problem into small, eminently defeatable parts. EXPOSE AND ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT'S SOFT FLANK: THE TURNING STRATEGY When you attack people directly, you stiffen their resistance and make your task that much harder. There is a better way: Distract your opponents' attention to the front, then attack them from the side, where they least expect it. Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weakness, then rake them with fire from the side. ENVELOP THE ENEMY: THE ANNIHILATION STRATEGY People will use any kind of gap in your defenses to attack you. So offer no gaps. The secret is to envelop your opponents--create relentless pressure on them from all sides and close off their access to the outside world. As you sense their weakening resolve, crush their willpower by tightening the noose. MANEUVER THEM INTO WEAKNESS: THE RIPENING-FOR-THE-SICKLE STRATEGY No matter how strong you are, fighting endless battles with people is exhausting, costly, and unimaginative. Wise strategists prefer the art of maneuver: Before the battle even begins, they find ways to put their opponents in positions of such weakness that victory is easy and quick. Create dilemmas:Devise maneuvers that give them a choice of ways to respond-all of them bad. NEGOTIATE WHILE ADVANCING: THE DIPLOMATIC-WARSTRATEGY Before and during negotiations, you must keep advancing, creating relentless pressure and compelling the other side to settle on your terms.The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.Create a reputation for being tough and uncompromising, so that people are back on their heels before they even meet you. KNOW HOW TO END THINGS: THE EXIT STRATEGY You are judged in this world by how well you bring things to an end. A messy or incomplete conclusion can reverberate for years to come. The art of endingthings well is knowing when to stop.The height of strategic wisdom is to avoid all conflicts and entanglements from which there are no realistic exits.",

Moreover, when referring to terrorized individuals, it is best that they not be confused with patients who simply anticipate the worst because of avoidable inefficiencies in given responsibilities. Terror is distinct. It is suggestive of living close to the abyss—an abyss characterized by primal chaos. Included are people who daily fear nuclear holocaust yet are fearful of getting involved in work aimed at ameliorating such threats. These are people who live in the wake of a dubious future with little notion of how to galvanize the necessary resources to cope with the deadly prospects of such a future.",

Here I share what it was like to navigate loss and feeling lost as part of my transition. When our old identity is hard to access and a new one is not yet formed, where do we turn?

Even Hemingway, that ostentatious connoisseur of the separate peace, came to realize, with another poet's help, that no man is an island. Neighbors, friends, relatives, countrymen, colleagues, heroes, and lovers help us to live not only by the material benefits they confer but by the feelings of warmth and comfort they inspire. In order to be fully ourselves, we need be part of humanity, not in the sense of being superior to others in some hierarchy of status, but in the sense of being intimately related to others in the most common and vital interests, such as the sharing of food and warmth in a home however we may choose to define the terms family and home. These intimate, largely emotional relations also depend on our use of language, and they can be corrupted, cut off, or crippled by misuse or awkward use of language. We have not done well, in my opinion, for the past few generations, in studying or in teaching the kind of language that builds and strengthens these relations the language, generally, of sympathetic understanding between human beings in a life-enhancing, life-promoting society. The results of our failure are too plain to see in the various gaps and barriers we rightly complain of these days: the generation gap, the color bar, the cold war, the sex war, and the credibility gaps that yawn around us on every side and threaten not only our comfort and happiness but our survival as a species on this small, fragile planet. For language to bridge these gaps, it is not enough that it be clear and precise.

      "title": "THE MORALITY OF GREGARIOUS EGOISM",
      "abstract": "PrefaceI will here defend ethical egoism or what I like to call the moral theory of benign selfishness. What matters to me is to show ordinary people that they should act so as to make the most of their human lives.It is evident enough, not in need of proof, that most people are not altruists; they live their lives mostly by attempting to take decent enough care of themselves. They eat breakfast, wash up, get dressed, etc., most mornings instead of rushing out to help other people (unless these are members of their immediate family or those faced with some emergency). Most of us earn a living so that we can spend the funds from this on what we need and want, not on others. We pay for membership at a gym so as to work out and become fit. We try to eat right so we are reasonably healthy. We pay to go to the movies so that they'd entertain us. We go shopping for items we believe we need or we want.When some people facetiously claim that we live in an age of Me, me and me, they are largely right but the truth of what they say is not morally objectionable. We do care for ourselves, first and foremost - which includes our loved ones - without much doubt, but in a benign way. We do not operate as if we lived in a zero sum world, so our effort to promote our own welfare isn't some campaign conducted against other people and theirs.This is what I have in mind by benign selfishness. It is not what many cynical folks mean when they say, Well, isn't everyone selfish? that is, that everyone is embarking on an aggressive, forceful, fierce campaign to come out ahead of others, as in some kind of (rat) race. (The idea brings to mind how millions of people drive throughout the globe, mostly pushing hard to get to a place ahead of others! But this tends to occur mainly in public places, which is a result of a version of the tragedy of the commons.1)So I will be discussing how benign selfishness and the socio-political conditions that make it possible are desirable and nothing to lament or besmirch, the way many social philosophers appear to feel about them.1.My Pitch for Some Solid SelfishnessHardly anyone will dispute that most folks who chime in about ethics consider selfishness wrong. It is nearly axiomatic in movies, novels, sitcoms, etc. There have been exceptions in history and some of the most prominent ethical philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, can even be said to have been ethical egoists or at least ones who championed the moral virtue of prudence as central for living a good human life. But after some significant changes in how human nature began to be understood, being selfish or selfinterested - or even prudent - began to be scoffed at, treated as a moral liability, not worthy of praise but of blame. But here is Socrates, in Plato's dialogue, Crito, being asked, you are gone, Socrates, how can we best act to please you? Socrates replies: Just follow my old recipe, my friend: do yourselves concern yourselves with your own true self-interest; then you will oblige and mine and yourself too.Of course, using one's common sense shows that being benignly selfish is what most of us are, normally, and routinely. When folks awake in the morning they proceed to begin to take good care of themselves before reaching out to help others. (Just as that announcement would have it on airplanes, first help yourself and then others in case there's loss of oxygen.)But apart from such common sense support, selfishness gets little respect (other than perhaps from psychotherapists who usually don't advise their clients not to care about themselves!). Moralists, however, often scoff at it. (Among them in our time are the famous ethics writers Peter Singer and Peter Unger.)So while selfishness is widely opposed by such official moralists as philosophers, priests, ministers, politicians, and pundits, most people will normally choose to be selfish instead of selfless. …",

      "abstract": "In this lyrical essay, Natanya Ann Pulley reflects upon a perhaps counterintuitive form of bravery: being vulnerable. She recounts her journey from worrying what to wear to teach and fears of not being taken seriously by students and colleagues to developing a confident presentation of self that allows for emotional expressions. She argues that showing emotion in contexts where professionalism demands being distant, cold, and emotionless is inherently brave. Through this essay, Natanya makes a case for a broader definition of bravery: \"Being brave means not only standing up and speaking when you'd rather slink away, but also finding the way that fits you best and honors what you hold valuable and vital even if our culture would call that way weak or lacking.\" She encourages other readers to harness the bravery of being vulnerable and emotional, rather than seeing emotions as weakness or incompetence.",

We rarely talk about our own siblings without emotion, whether with love and gratitude, or exasperation, bitterness, anger and hate. Nevertheless, the subject of what it is to be and to have a sibling is one that has been ignored by psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists. In My Dearest Enemy, My Dangerous Friend, Dorothy Rowe presents a radically new way of thinking about siblings that unites the many apparently contradictory aspects of these complex relationships. This helps us to recognise the various experiences involved in sibling relationships as a result of the fundamental drive for survival and validation, enabling us to reach a deeper understanding of our siblings and ourselves. If you have a sibling, or you are bringing up siblings, or, as an only child, you want to know what you're missing, this is the book for you.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When should we interfere in the course of a stranger’s life? While philosophers have discussed at length extreme cases of assisting poor people in famine stricken countries, much less attention has been given to casual, everyday episodes. If I overhear two people discussing a place they are about to visit, and know that it is closed for renovation, should I interfere and tell them so? If I stand next to a customer who has not been given enough change in the supermarket, should I point that out or mind my own business? Using the Kantian notions of love and respect, I answer such questions. I claim that Kant’s terminology is ill-suited for instructing us how to deal with others with whom we are personally involved, but is important for our encounters with strangers. I suggest that we take seriously Kant’s claim that we are “united in one dwelling place”. When around others, keep an open eye to the possibility that they might need help. If there is good reason to suppose that you may help, knock on their door. Let them decide whether they want to open it. They are totally entitled to decline the offer, but should keep in mind that it was given as part of the joint venture of living together with others. The interference should therefore not be regarded as an infringement of privacy.",

Our aim with this study, which was informed by phenomenology, was to describe and identify invariant meanings in the experience of life after major burn injury. Fourteen adults having sustained a major burn were interviewed, on average, 14 months postinjury, and asked about their experience of important aspects of life. The accident meant facing an extreme situation that demanded vigilance, appropriate action, and the need for assistance. The aftermath of the burn injury and treatment included having to put significant effort into creating coherence in their disrupted personal life stories. Continuing life meant accepting the unchangeable, including going through recurrent processes of enduring, grief, fatalism, comparisons with others, and new feelings of gratefulness. Furthermore, a continuous struggle to change what was changeable, to achieve personal goals, independence, relationships with others, and a meaningful life, were all efforts to regain freedom, aiming for a life as it was before--and sometimes even better.",

My use of domestic objects and their disquieted patterns are in reference to a displaced environment that I find reliable and not foreign. My past, present, and future are unknown to me. I don't know where I came from; I cannot differentiate what is genetic vs. what is learned, or in general who I am. Most of the questions I have will never be answered or have a conclusion, I try to hide them, pack them away and try to forget they are there. That doesn't quite work out so well in the end. I know who I am, according to how my parents raised me. That much I am certain of. I make to remember, honor, revisit, and instill a sense of belonging that I have not always felt.",

      "abstract": "In this sense, a personal narrative is an attempt to impose meaning \nand order on a life course (Gergen, 1977, 1980). However, individual \nlives typically include events that are experienced as unpredictable, \nunjust, or chaotic. Such events may be perceived simply as irritations-one damn thing after another —or as genuine catastrophes: My life \nhas been ruined. This latter experience can be translated as \nnarrative by which I understand my life has been fundamentally \ndiscredited. As divorce lawyers, psychiatrists, and historians well \nknow, it is often difficult to assign responsibility for even such cata­\nstrophic events to particular forces or persons-a dynamic that can \nundermine narrative intelligibility.

      "title": "From Violence, Toward Love: One Therapist's Journey",
      "abstract": "Bridging the personal and the professional, Marjorie Holiman emphasizes how violence destroys relationships while respect and love generate new connections. Like many in our society, Holiman grew up in a household where the fabric of everyday life was torn intermittently and unpredictably by violence. Later she experienced her own potential for violence, teetering on the edge between intention and action. Reaching out for help from others and drawing on her own insight and determination, Holiman turned from violence toward love. The therapist makes connections between her own experiences and those of others-the taste of fear, the intrusion of troubling memories, the impulse to hurt again, the glimmer of hope. She does not simply relate her cases; she lets the reader feel what it is like to work with people who are violent and those who have been violated-the times she struggles to understand the experiences of others and the celebrations she shares with people who are changing. After setting a context for therapy and for understanding violent situations, Holiman outlines nine therapy tasks to help people change, including attention to safety, responsibility, retribution, and forgiveness. She does not shy away from the difficult topics: clients' memories of Satanic cults, the politics of therapy and their effects on practice, and mistakes the therapist will likely make. Lyrical and moving, From Violence, Toward Love tackles one of the most difficult problems of any society with a balance of practicality and deep humanity. Readers who join Marjorie Holiman on her journey will not be disappointed.",

      "abstract": "One of the common themes in existential philosophy is that our being-in-the-world, our living, is without an intrinsic meaning. A meaningful life does not appear by magic but is a purposeful process of choices that we make on our path towards becoming, towards a more authentic being. The existential position contends that we choose to create ourselves and that there are always many possibilities available from which to choose. These possibilities, and indeed our freedom, need to be discovered within our limitations and, often, against the backdrop of a sense of meaninglessness. Freedom is seen against the backdrop of the existential limitations of ontological givens such as death and our own facticity or the more personally limiting situations – the confrontation of who we are and what we need to tackle in the face of dread, guilt, and anxiety.",

All things desire to be quick, simple, helpful, and satisfying. A culture that is averse to effort, care, and empathy will become hardworking due to this character. The life guidance derived from regional culture and beliefs must be rebuilt. A literary piece called Serat Wedatama, which takes the form of a macapat song, contains moral lessons. It is essential to continuously work towards fostering self-discipline, perseverance, creativity, independence, and democracy founded on sincerity, patience, and sincerity. It is possible to purify the heart and mind through selfless work, which affects behaviour that is not constrained by professional outcomes. An incentive to put in the extra effort will be a disciplined character that has become ingrained. Genuinely working hard and dedicating all of one's creations and emotions will yield satisfying results. The ability or self-intuition that generates creative ideas will awaken with sincere effort. A sense of self-confidence fostered by creative ideas can help someone become independent. Coexisting in various societal contexts is also a necessary component of independence. Humans must cooperate while putting mutual respect and appreciation first in order to establish democracy in a society with a variety of conditions and characters.",

      "title": "When words are not enough: How creative storytelling helped me navigate trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic experiences trigger a constellation of psychological and emotional symptoms. Therapeutic interventions have been developed to support people in understanding and overcoming these symptoms. However, many approaches have a strong reliance on language. This can be problematic as traumatic experiences create significant barriers to the brain's ability to translate experiences into words. Many victims of trauma experience a phenomenon known as ‘speechless terror’—the inability to access language after trauma because of the extreme fear brought on by the event/series of events. This creates a challenge; how can someone benefit from an intervention that relies on verbal or written expression if trauma has made it difficult (or impossible) for them to translate their experiences into words? While both written and verbal communication can support individuals in recovering from trauma, sometimes words are not enough. And when words are not enough, the visual arts can serve as an alternative language that allows for open, non‐verbal exploration of memories and emotions. As a survivor of trauma, I have used both verbal and non‐verbal methods in my own journey toward trauma healing. Words are an essential tool in my verbal processing of trauma. But sometimes words are not enough. And when words are not enough, creative expression in the form of mixed media visual art has provided me with an alternative language to navigate my own speechless terror. In my creative use of verbal and non‐verbal forms of expression, I experienced an increased sense of self‐understanding. This article explores (1) the limitations of language in processing trauma, (2) the potential for creative approaches to serve as an antidote to speechless terror, and (3) my personal use of both written narratives and visual artwork to navigate my own traumatic experiences.",

      "abstract": "Pity is an emotion which is intimately connected with virtue. If I were impervious to anger I could still be a paragon of rectitude. My emotional peculiarity might even be explained by moral saintliness. If I had a pitiless heart my entire life would surely be an abject moral failure. The imputation of an inability to pity strikes us as a damning moral criticism; it is one we are likely to make, for example, against those who commit acts of extreme cruelty. Yet pity is hardly ever welcomed by its recipients, and for that reason it differs in a puzzling way from other emotions which are closely associated with virtue, such as gratitude or compassion. The prospect of becoming an object of pity is alarming, and not merely because we fear the misfortune that would evoke pity in others; it is alarming in part because we suspect that being on the receiving end of that emotion could seriously aggravate our plight. We also regard an aversion to being pitied as commendable, perhaps even morally commendable. There is something shameful in wanting to be pitied, just as there is in the indulgence of self-pity. The aged and the physically disabled do not want our pity, as a rule, and we think better of them for not wanting it. Finally, we know that those who give pity are frequently guilty of serious wrongdoing. A pitiless heart may be a terrible thing, but a fondness for dispensing pity is scarcely any better.",

In The Fall of the House of Usher, Edgar Allan Poe unveiled a character utterly consumed by the “work of worry.” He could wear only garments of a certain texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ... there was little which did not inspire him with horror ... I found him a bound slave. [He said to me] “I shall perish .. . I shall be lost. I dread the events of the future ... I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial incident ... the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm of FEAR.”",

      "abstract": "In our professional lives we meet many people and it is important to be cognisant of all network development possibilities and learn to see everyone as a potential collaborator, colleague or mentor that can be drawn on throughout an entire career. There are some people with whom connections will be formed that are able to be maintained as close relationships with regular ongoing contact. Others may be more casual, and exist to meet a particular need, and these relationships, while productive for a time may come to a natural conclusion. Thus, we draw on the analogy of the season, reason or lifetime, and in so doing think it useful that we regularly take the time to reflect on what sort of colleague we want to be to others, and what sort of colleagues we want for ourselves.There is a saying that people come into our lives for a reason, a season or a lifetime (author unknown), and we argue that this idea can also have currency in the professional realm with colleagues and other professional connections. As an editorial team, we are geographically distant from one another and between us, we have had successful international careers that have spanned clinical, administrative and academic environments. We have faced our share of challenges along the way. In preparing this special issue of the journal, we reflect on our own careers; the importance of developing and maintaining positive, strong and resilient collegial relationships and the role these relationships have played in our own careers.Nursing is undoubtedly a very rewarding career choice. However, it can also be high pressure and like other professions, there are a number of workplace challenges that can influence career satisfaction and progress. The literature is replete with evidence that the nursing workplace can be affected by all manner of problems that can impede the formation of productive collegial relationships. These problems include negative and highly pressured work environments that are sometimes complicated by factors such as breaches of trust, bullying, harassment, workplace incivility or other negative issues (Hutchinson, Vickers, Wilkes, & Jackson, 2009; Jackson et al., 2010). Such difficulties are commonplace; they are reflective of poor leadership (Cleary, Horsfall, Deacon, & Jackson, 2011; Jackson, Hutchinson, Peters, Luck, & Saltman, 2012), and can affect the clinical, administrative and academic working environments, and render the workplace less amenable to the creation of positive collegial relationships.Given that the work environment can be experienced as unsupportive and even hostile at times, it behoves all of us who are interested in building a sustainable career, to explore strategies for self-care and self-nurturance in the working environment. We argue that positive collegial relationships can not only mitigate the negative effects of a noxious or unhappy working environment, but are fundamental to the development of a successful career. We look back over our own careers and recognise the importance of our positive collegial relationships and suggest that these relationships can also be an invaluable strategy for sustaining self and maintaining performance and output, even in the face of lack of workplace support, or organisational and workplace difficulties. These important professional relationships survive tests of time, differences of opinion, periods of adversity and endure changes in jobs and location. These are relationships that are not swayed by changing circumstances or the perceived power of either partner - these are relationships that are honest, durable and authentic.These special relationships can take various forms. Some will involve sustained and regular close contact, while others may have a more distant quality, with partners dipping in and out over the course of a career, but with a shared understanding that the relationship is there to be drawn on when needed. Furthermore, in the current context of high workplace mobility comes the need to nurture and maintain the good relationships we have. …",

      "title": "Personal Views: The hazards of good memory",
      "abstract": "Forgetting is bad. Remembering is always good. Or so I thought until I met patients with unexpected benefits of memory loss. “It will be a blessing if I lose my mind,” one patient said. “I'll probably be happy not knowing I owe anybody!” Andy Rooney wrote, in his 1982 book, And More by Andy Rooney, “Sadness is one of the principal ingredients of memory, and there's just so much of that [that] anyone wants to bring on himself on purpose by sitting around remembering.” All this raises an important question in my mind. Is forgetfulness nature's way of enforcing forgiveness, the letting go of past wrongs and sorrows, the memory of which can only sadden the ageing mind, with little chance for reconciliation and closure?\r\n\r\nIn pondering this question I wonder whether the evolutionary reason for the high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease among those aged 80 or older is to shield ageing minds from the vagaries of the past, the company of friends and family severed, the sadness that comes with dreams unfulfilled. Was I being too picky in correcting the medical student who introduced his 91 year old patient as being “pleasantly demented with no complaints”? My premise—that there is nothing pleasant about Alzheimer's disease—conflicts with occasional sightings of apparently happy patients living with the disease. Maybe the medical student is right after all.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill memory enhancement therapy make these patients happier or more agitated and less functional?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the student is right, will memory enhancement therapy make these patients happier or more agitated and less functional? To answer this question I rely on my recent clinical observations: achieving evidence based treatment goals of improved cognition may not always match the goals of success defined by patients and their carers. I have also become more aware of the importance of constant re-evaluation of and listening to the treatment goals expressed by patients and their carers, whose priorities may not fit neatly into our evidence based treatment guidelines for cognition improvement treatment.\r\n\r\nA number of unexpected symptoms may emerge as cognition improves in response to treatment: reliving a painful stage of Alzheimer's disease already surpassed, unmasking of depression and anxiety, and re-experiencing of a long forgotten bereavement and dysphoria. Perhaps an example from my practice may better illustrate these unexpected symptoms. A recently widowed 78 year old patient with Alzheimer's disease was coping well with her daily living activities, with some help from her sister. She received a cholinesterase inhibitor for six months. She became more despondent, lost weight, and became increasingly agitated. In her newly observed delusion, she spent hours having heated arguments with her deceased husband. Clinical assessment and investigations showed no obvious cause. In line with the family's request the treatment was stopped. Within three months her appetite improved, her delusion resolved, and she became less despondent and agitated. Perhaps the sadness and sorrow of bereavement are not worth remembering.\r\n\r\nThe case for using drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease is strong: temporary improvements in cognition and function, with some palliation of behavioural disturbances (BMJ 2001;323: 123-4 [PubMed]). However, when the clinician's goals no longer match the values and preferences of patients and their families, we are in violation of the principle of “first do no harm.”\r\n\r\nWith new treatments and better diagnostic tools on the horizon, it becomes even more imperative that patients' values, expectations, and preferences are at the centre of the treatment decision making process. In a book review Dr Peter Whitehouse, who also happened to have Alzheimer's disease, said: “Between normality and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease there are more hilly, continuous relations than chasms of categorical distinctions. Alzheimer's disease is a social marker, and those who control this marker are powerful” (New England Journal of Medicine 2001;347: 861).\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, we should constantly ask the question, when choosing anti-dementia treatments, of what is in the best interest of our patients and their loved ones. Adhering to the principle of “first do no harm” is following evidence based guidelines—such as those published by the Canadian consensus conference on dementia (Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences 2001;28(suppl 1): S3-16 [PubMed]) and the American Academy of Neurology (Neurology 2001;56: 1154-66 [PubMed])—while being aware of the potential but unexpected “hazards” of good memory.",

One day, parents realize that the pretend friend they have been hearing about for months, or even years, is no longer mentioned. A once-cherished stuffed animal ends up in the back of the closet; invisible beings dis¬ appear without a trace. These endings are typically difficult to pin¬ point and can be as perplexing as the initial appearances. When children are asked what happened to their imaginary companions, they usually report that they don’t remember. Curiously, they also express very little sadness or regret. Note that in Peter, Paul, and Mary’s well-known song, it is Puff the Magic Dragon, not Jackie Pa¬ per, who mourns when their relationship is over. In real life most children, like the fictional Jackie, give up imaginary companions without fuss or fanfare.

      "title": "俗談(ことわざ)을 통해 본 日本人",
      "abstract": "This paper attempts to deal with how the art of living, characteristic features, ways of thinking, distinction between the sexes, views of the language and money are represented in Japanese proverbs. Major findings are as follows : 1) In the art of living, the Japanese tend to be realistic, practical, and selfish. In addition, they are opportunistic and value saving one's face. They also pay respect to those who are in power. On the other hand, they look down upon the weak. In everyday life, they judge diligence and sincerity based on the facts such as how early they get up and how hard they work, and they also give high value to persistent efforts and patience. 2) Regarding characteristic features, Japanese people are portrayed to be quite ambivalent; they are in general warm-hearted toward neighbors but from time to time they are mean to them. Accordingly, it is hard to predict when they would change their attitudes from being kind to being evil-minded toward neighbors. On the other hand, they sometimes do disgraceful or impersonal things with no scruple when they are not seen by others. Moreover, in order to hide their weakness, they don't usually hesitate to boast themselves and justify their behavior. The Japanese have a very solid attitude toward friendship. They believe the friends of the past can not become the enemies of the day. Thus, their relationship is built upon a high standard of courtesy and moderation. 3) Gender-related proverbs portrait women positively only in a limited sense. Overall, the predominance of men over women prevails. This has been formed since the aristocracy of Heian period (A.D. 794～1192) and through the 700-years-long ruling by Samurais. Particularly, the confucianism which was the political ideology of Tokukawa period (A.D. 1603～1867) played a major role in promoting the gender segregation. 4) With regard to the use of language, many proverbs deal with the verbosity and the negative use of language. Thus, Japanese people are very much prudent when they communicate each other. 5) Proverbs dealing with money matters often show that Japanese people are devoted to the pursuit of wealth and they are likely to clearly define where their interests lie even between parents and children.",

In such situations, the only compassionate response is to take people in. With the ongoing mass migration to Europe, these refugees pay smugglers to take them to safety, but there is no safe place to go since nobody wants them. They leave in a rush to save their lives and their families due to political and religious fear, death threats, rape of women, or forced labor. They do not have time to mourn the losses, there is no time for “ideal migration” where destination countries can choose whom they will take in. The initial hope and dream to escape to a safe “haven” is transformed into a nightmare of humiliation and fear. These asylum seekers will be or already are suffering from PTSD due to massive psychic trauma.",

They have no other choice but to flee and leave their country to seek safety; this means leaving a lot behind, one of the most complex decisions a person can ever take. So what makes a person a Refugee? From where do they come? Furthermore, where are they going? And how is the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office helping them? Refugees frequently flee with nothing more than the clothing on their backs, abandoning their daily lives. They may lose their home, savings, jobs, and, more often than not, their families and loved ones. The journey to safety can be long and full of dangers. During the journey, people can get hurt, and unfortunately, many people die; all of this can create serious trauma. In this article, let us look at the journeys people are leaving and which they are arriving in. And what destinies await them.",

We shudder with them. We feel drawn to express sympathy. We cry. Most people feel, shortly thereafter, “Why did someone do this?” “How could he (we usually think, ‘he’)?” “What sort of monster is he?” As people engaged in capital defense work, we think about the murderer as well, but in different terms—how traumatized this person must have been, how unloved, un-nurtured, and impaired, how hurt he must have been. One of us is then appointed to represent this person. We turn all our attention to the tasks of representation—assembling a defense team, interviewing and working with our client, investigating the crime and our client’s life, getting and pouring through discovery, preparing and filing motions,",

      "abstract": "Everybody knows a Joe. Joe is the kind of guy who was the most popular boy in class, head boy at school, the life and soul of the party, and whenever he needs something, it just seems to happen for him. This is the guy we love to hate! Why is he getting all the breaks when we have to work so damn hard? As we continue to grind out each day at work, we see Joe is the guy with a big house, fast car, and the most beautiful women swooning over him. Most men would give their right arm to have a bit of that magic. So, how does he do it? Of course, I cannot tell you for sure (if I could my next book would be a bestselling self-help book), but it should come as no surprise that people with more friends and contacts tend to be more successful than people with fewer. Intuitively, we know that these people, by virtue of their wide range of contacts, seem to have more support and opportunity to make the choices they want. Likewise, again it’s no surprise that more interconnected societies tend to be able to cope better with challenging events than ones where people are segregated or isolated. Initially it seems unlikely that this connectedness has anything to do with Shannon’s information theory; after all what does sending a message down a telephone line have to do with how societies function or respond to events? The first substantial clue that information may play some role in sociology came in 1971 from the American economist and Nobel Laureate, Thomas Schelling. Up until his time sociology was a highly qualitative subject (and still predominantly is); however he showed how certain social paradigms could be approached in the same rigorous quantitative manner as other processes where exchange of information is the key driver. Schelling is an interesting character. He served with the Marshall Plan (the plan to help Europe recover after World War II), the White House, and the Executive Office of the President from 1948 to 1953, as well as holding a string of positions at illustrious academic institutions, including Yale and Harvard.",

      "title": "Apathy and Meteors",
      "abstract": "Uncommon in poets, artists, and priests, apathy is curiously common in physicians, who should care but do not. Its genesis resides not in the long arduous years of training when sleepless nights and callous superiors might be imagined to inflict the disease, but rather after, when one might have assumed that income, family, independence, and authority might have conferred some immunity. In physicians, apathy is especially egregious. Its nature is such that it conceals from the afflicted its very presence, and so the diseased assumes the arrogant air of one above it all, detached, removed, objective, the deserving object of pride. There is a necessity about it, a noblesse oblige—it becomes prized therefore, and so can grow, metastasize, and supplant proper function, as would a cancer. At the highest levels, the brain becomes addled. Ignorance is confused with iconoclasm, banality with prosaism. The victim ceases to read. He has already arrived. He spurns learning. He has enjoyed the finest training. Journals, research, new studies, recent advances he views as unproven, faddish, vagarious, maggoty. At the more mundane level of daily functioning, he becomes slipshod, slapdash, and derelict, yet he sees this as an efficiency born of experience. Morning rounds become perfunctory, a facade, evening rounds, forsaken. That which is missed, or worse, ignored, is deemed irrelevant, inconsequential. His patients do poorly, but only because, in his view, he is saddled with such difficult cases. Requests for consultation are an intrusion; students’ needs, burdensome, impeditive, onerous. To the unimpassioned observer, it should not be surprising that those in the advanced stages of the disease exhibit a frantic, sometimes comical (occasionally outrageous) pursuit of reviviscence. Hence the red Ferrari, the lavish home, the enervating hobby, the mistress, the extravagant vacation, and conspicuous consumption of many descriptions. If these desperate measures do not in themselves advance the primary disease process, they do invariably prove unsuccessful at alleviating its symptoms and usually complicate the victim’s disease state. Despite the energy and money expended, despite the time consumed and distractions pursued, the ennui remains. Things become all important.Money and the means to it replace Profession and the pride in it. The apathy-afflicted physician senses, perhaps for the first time in the course of the illness, that he is trapped, and he may become angry, bitter, and vengeful at this realization. He will believe these emotions are justified, and he may even act out against those around him who, he believes, have caused his unhappiness. This is stage IV disease. Its pain at this point is fierce, though often masked by denial, distraction, and strength of personality. But death of the spirit is always painful, even if unrecognized. Seeing such pain, such complex affliction, a friend or colleague is tempted to “throw” a cure at Dr LaCombe is a cardiologist in Augusta, Me. THE ART AND THE CALLING",

Happiness is linked with the satisfaction of material needs to have meaning when they are limited, is well protected slavery as the value of work that does not allow distractions to hinder their development, avoiding material excess, but the work renders freedom it is imperative to meet the needs of daily living. Aristotle argues that happiness only appears at leisure, so the games must be conducted in parallel with the work, taking a break from work fatigue and leading to a break that emanates from the game. Happiness is in terms of the obtained and enjoyed, and an expected life is to enjoy every moment at work, it is likewise necessary to have free time, which becomes more and more in an attempt to find roots, enjoying the remoteness of the lonely. Unemployment is presented here as a threat to the enjoyment of life, underemployment is presented which should be taken into account in the unemployment, it is not a job, is a “how to get what the newspaper?” Is disguised unemployment but it is a real unemployment. This, unemployment will become more sense, though employment as such moves towards the services sector, here are tourism, which in industrialized countries generates a very high percentage of total jobs, but should not forget that in what is to happen are the effects and damage on employment. Thus, the income generated by employment make holidays a trend that should continue even if they have the means, and that man should not allow the loss of his humanity for the work, you must keep it at leisure. The challenge is then the generation of a new economic and tourism sector which results in the Postmodern Tourism.",

Claims of urgency – ‘act now before it is too late!’ – conduct the aff ective charge of these sometimes abject and oft en partially unimaginable futures. Yet urgency is rarely self-evident, but a claim in which the distribution of rights and resources, and particular forms of knowledge and expertise, are at stake. Which social actors are most invested in urgency and why? What possibilities does formatting a situation as ‘urgent’ foreclose and what questions does it make impossible to ask? What happens to claims of urgency when they become protracted and routinised? Alternatively, under what conditions might claims of urgency presage new openings?",

      "abstract": "Nobody just walks into a classroom and begins to teach without some consideration of self-presentation, much as nobody sits down to write a poem, an essay, or a novel without considering the voice behind the words, its tone and texture, and the traditions of writing within a particular genre. Voice is everything in literature, playing in the mind of the writer, the ear of the reader; the search for authenticity in that voice is the writer’s work of a lifetime. What I want to suggest here is that teachers, like writers, also need to invent and cultivate a voice, one that serves their personal needs as well as the material at hand, one that feels authentic. It should also take into account the nature of the students who are being addressed, their background in the subject and their disposition as a class, which is not always easy to gauge. It takes a good deal of time, as well as experimentation, to find this voice, in teaching as in writing. For the most part, the invention of a teaching persona is a fairly conscious act. Teachers who are unconscious of their teaching self might get lucky; that is, they might adopt or adapt something familiar—a manner, a voice—that actually works in the classroom from the beginning. Dumb luck happens. But most of the successful teachers I have known have been deeply aware that their selfpresentation involves, or has involved at some point, the donning of a mask. This taking on of a mask, or persona (from the Latin word implying that a voice is something discovered by “sounding through” a mask, as in per/sona), is no simple process. It involves artifice, and the art of teaching is no less complicated than any other art form. It is not something “natural,” i.e., “found in nature.” A beginning teacher will have to try on countless masks before finding one that fits, that seems appropriate, that works to organize and embody a teaching voice. In most cases, a teacher will have a whole closet full of masks to try on for size.",

      "abstract": "At every stage in our lives, we are confronted by the inevitability of our own ageing. As we progress through the ‘journey of life’, we are acutely conscious of the ageing process as it affects our bodies, our attitudes, the environment we create for ourselves and our interactions with other people of different ages. In personal relationships, we tend to choose friends and partners from those proximate in age – most ‘lonely hearts’ advertisements stipulate age – and the fact is that most people are still fascinated or even horrified by intimate relationships that span wide age-gaps: Joan Collins's marriage in early 2002, to a man thirty-three years her junior, was newsworthy precisely because it broke such unwritten, but powerful, rules. Most of us are intensely aware of the precise social demarcations based upon age, and feel uncomfortable if we stray into an age-inappropriate social setting (a nightclub for the twenty-somethings on the one hand, a summer evening game of bowls on the other).

      "abstract": "Nowadays, money has invaded all areas of life, or very nearly so. With the exception of a privileged few, the existence of every adult, and even that of hundreds of millions of working children, is shot through with the oppressive anxiety of earning it. It is the most invisible and effective constraint that forces some to work in an attempt to survive; for others, the enslaving obsession that pushes them to accumulate more and more wealth, when the thirst for gold devours their spirit; for some still, an opportunity to be seized to finance the choice of activities or projects. Not being able to read and write is a terrible handicap, but not being able to speak the language of money, even if it is only basic, is a mortal danger, because, apart from Robinson Crusoe, no one can provide for himself or herself without being able to count it.",

      "abstract": "Learning to live with frailty and finitude is both a lifelong agenda and particular to the wisdom of ageing. The desire for long life, therefore, must include a recognition that forever is finite. Being finite, as the term is used here, is the condition of being limited that defines humanness. Facing finitude includes an awareness of mortality, frailty, and death. This essay explores the benefits of accepting both dependence and interdependence, agency and waiting, and receiving and giving ourselves in self-forgetful ways. The whole of life, including growing old, is gift to be received with gratitude and worked on with courage. The wisdom of growing older begins with accepting the inevitability of ageing without becoming 'old'. Facing limits does not diminish curiosity or the desire to learn or make new friends. And if we listen, ageing persons will teach us how to accept this gift of years with all its ambiguity and paradox and pass it on. We hold this paradoxical wisdom of ageing only long enough to give it away.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The superstitious man ... treats everything as a blow from god or an assault of some daemonic power. It does not matter what it is: illness, financial loss, the death of a child, ill-luck or failure in politics. In the catalog of misfortunes that Plutarch can anticipate befalling his superstitious man (Superstition 6), the death of a child is the only one that might strike the modern western reader as possibly odd. Becoming sick, losing money, failing in public life (for those who choose such a career)-these are eventualities that may overtake anyone and comprise just a few of the many risks of ordinary daily life. As far as mortality is concerned, however, people today generally expect to die in generational sequence, so that the death of a child is not an easily predictable event. Most people have their first experience of death as children or young adults when their grandparents die. They then expect in midlife to lose their parents; and when they reach an advanced age and anticipate their own demise most people expect to have children, and often grandchildren, to survive them. Tragedies of course sometimes intervene to disrupt expectations: there is still the fatal illness or accident or crime that takes a child away prematurely. But that is precisely my point: when a child dies the event is tragic because of its abnormality.",

      "abstract": "Vinodorus, the drunkard, explains that he cannot stand success; he works hard, achieves his goal, and then throws all away in a ruinous drinking bout. Under Socrates' questioning, Vinodorus perceives that success to him means to be admired as a successful man. Socrates suggests that Vinodorus is satisfied with opinion, the semblance of knowledge, rather than the reality; that he seeks the approval of others rather than real knowledge or understanding. Such a man becomes less himself, exiles himself to live in reflected and distorted light, as in a cave; truth remains a shadow having no power to help shape his vision unless it can pass into his own way of seeing and is included in his vision. Vinodorus is led to see that the rewards attendant on success are worthless to him. He drinks, therefore, finding in wine what he was seeking in success; and he continues to drink in order to recapture and keep that “inner glow.” Only when drunk is Vinodorus assured and confident and has ideas that seem true and great. Socrates suggests that his lack of selfconfidence while sober originates in his lack of knowledge; that he is trying to change himself by mimicking others—but such change is temporary and superficial. True change transforms the self by shaping one's vision and leads to a more profound relationship with reality. He asks Vinodorus to observe himself, even while on a binge, so that at their next meeting, Vinodorus can be led to a closer understanding of himself.",

He grew up in an atmosphere of fairly conventional piety, but as the years went by he found he could not teach traditional Christian beliefs because they presented him with more and more problems. These led him to the reinterpretation given here, which is not just a negative approach, but gives positive grounds for hope. Above all. Or Pittenger writes with a deep love and well-tried experience only to be found in someone in the latest years of life. As he comments, most of those for whom he has cared most are now dead, and he has had to live and cope with the fact of their parting. If the accepted ideas of life after death have to go, something better can take their place. Readers must discover the details for themselves, but they will be heartened in doing so by Dr Pittenger's own experience: 'When the more conventional talk, so familiar and often (alas) so superficial in its attempt at securing some permanent value for those loved persons, has been subjected to the kind of critical analysis which is proper to any inherited belief, then the certain conviction that in God the value of human existence is guaranteed and the worth of all those for whom one has cared is assured, becomes an abiding and unshakable occasion for Joy Norman Pittenger is a senior member of King's College, Cambridge.",

The first psychologists pointed out that society is only a mirror in which the individual sees himself, and the individual begins to form a self-defined concept from the very first moment of his life where he begins to gather information about himself and the others surrounding him in the environment, and the environment in which he lives and belongs, to be the result of his interaction, friction and dealings with the social environment in which he lives a lot of emotions, emotions and sensations that accumulate day after day and quickly learns how to relieve his pain and sorrows and how to overcome the difficulties and obstacles faced in life as he realizes at the same time what he feels With psychological relief, and the full motivation of his motives, provoking his tendencies and brought to his attention, and this study to recognize the comparison of the concept of self and the image of the other in a sample of male and female juveniles within the juvenile institutions in Greater Cairo, the study sample included (218) individual for both males and females, and divided The sample is as follows (180) Single male juveniles, 38 single female juveniles. This study belonged to the descriptive study and the researchers used the comparative analytical descriptive approach, using regular random sample, the researchers used the preliminary data form and then use the measure of self-concept of the work of the researchers to measure the psychological and social dimension of the concept of self and the image of the other sample of research, as the researchers relied on some statistical methods in the study including the test of T-test, and costs, percentages, averages and standard deviation. It is clear from the statistical analysis that the alpha value of the exclusion of the self-concept and the image of the other in juvenile delinquents (psychological dimension of self-conception, social dimension of the concept of self, the psychological dimension of the image of the other, the sociological aspect of the image of the other) (0.824, 0.818, 0.823, 0.816) Value is higher than (0.5) so it was a good firming. For further analysis, the researchers calculated the sincerity of internal consistency and the corrected correlation coefficient for each of the study's axes with the total scale to calculate the honesty the moral significance of the dimensions of the self-concept and the image of the other in juvenile delinquents in the psychological and social dimension is less than (0.01), demonstrating the sincerity of the internal consistency of the scale.\r\nThe present study has reached the following conclusions: There are no statistically significant differences between males and females in the psychological and social dimension of the concept of self within the juvenile institutions in Greater Cairo.",

As my situation deteriorated that freshman year in college, whatever self-confidence I had disappeared, and I became more and more pessimistic, jaded, cynical, and hopeless. College life was supposed to be different from my life back in Los Angeles. After all, I didn’t travel 3,000 miles to experience the same alienated crap I had to deal with at home. I had come to escape the pain and find some happiness. I was trying to be more social, but that wasn’t consistent with my introverted nature (though I had yet to accept that). I tried to make sense of the isolation. Why couldn’t I have more friends? Why was college, my last hope, failing to bring me happiness?",

Give of yourself. Consider others. It may say, Look out for number one. Take. The weak finish last. Spells are cast by the suggestions that we make through the attitudes we exhibit, the example we provide, the instructions we give, or even the manner in which the instructions are given. Some people, merely by their manner, can anger half of the people in a room, just by walking through it. The reverse is also true: Some people can make most of the people around them happy, just by being in their presence. Sometimes the spell that is cast is minor and shortlived. But other spells may have far-reaching effects and last a lifetime. Teachers are constantly casting spells over the students in their presence. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for teachers to think about this phenomenon and consider how it may be affecting their students and classroom environment.",

      "title": "Being in a Lived Retreat—Embodied Meaning of Alleviated Suffering",
      "abstract": "Meanings of alleviated suffering in persons living with life-threatening cancer are explored in this life–world phenomenologic study. In repeated conversations, 16 patients with cancer who were receiving palliative care shared their embodied experiences in personal narratives. When interpreting the narratives, the following meanings of experiencing alleviation of suffering were disclosed: an endurable body being independent and feeling at home, feelings of connectedness, taking a long view of the suffering, being lifted out of the suffering, and an inner peace. Movements that were found in alleviation were dampening the suffering, arousing a zest for life, and focusing on both the present and the patient's dignity. As an interpreted whole, alleviation of suffering was found to be an embodied experience of \"being in a lived retreat.\" This is a symbolic place owned by the person and is experienced in either the company of others or solitude. This lived retreat can provide a feeling of being at home, creating peace, rest, confidence, and breathing space in the person's suffering. It means coping with the altered lived body and feeling dignified. This is a personal experience that is both intersubjectively created and dependent. The importance of openness and responsibility in palliative care is emphasized in the findings and the notion of control of suffering in palliative care is accordingly rejected.",

The question is how can a person be more graceful as (s)he grows older. Instead of being referred to as “an old fart” (“an offensive phrase usually referring to someone in authority who is set in their ways or lacking a sense of fun” (Candappa, 2004: 9); older persons can, in fact have, more licenses to enjoy their work, living and leading. And this is what this paper is all about. Keywords : Aging, aging management, detachment; people-person; learning; positive thinking Introduction Getting old? Get over it! In our mind’s eye, all of us should not see ‘old’ as being a negative thing. Verily, age is just a number. And indeed all of us should age gracefully. And interestingly so, as Robert (Bo) Bennett once said, “having a positive mental attitude is asking how something can be done rather than saying it can’t be done”.",

And the response by those who hear both the questions and the emotions expressed through them is likely to be deep embarrassment, a strong wish to change the subject, a will to behave as if the questions had not been asked.

They represent resources to be drawn upon. Often they are very valuable to themselves—they love life and they are shown respect and appreciation.

Quality of life is something inside you and it accompanies you wherever you go. Many people think that it is a matter of chance whether there is quality of life and surplus energy. Some people are born un der a lucky star, they say, while others had a bad start. By chance some humans have better genes and by nature they are the chosen few, the beautiful, the talented and the marvelous, whi le the rest of us must accept the twists of nature and accept being plain, a bit boring not possessed of the most brilliant minds.

A few potentially hazardous situations include entrance into the field, role conflicts, fieldwork in the inner city, ethnographic reports, and dissemination of findings. Job stress and burnout pose an additional problem. Urban fieldwork in particular forces an ethnographer to confront the realities of guilty knowledge—confidential knowledge of illegal activities—and dirty hands—a situation from which one can not emerge innocent of wrongdoing. Developing moral decision-making guidelines is imperative if one is to deal effectively with these problems. The risk-benefit approach, the respect-for-persons ethic, and basic pragmatism must all be used as guidelines in the field. Other hazards range from fieldwork conducted at an accelerated pace, to reporting in a highly political atmosphere. Many of these pressures affect one's judgment while in the field—whether in the streets of the inner city or in plush conference rooms ...",

Famine and war evoke strong emotional reactions, and for most people there is a limited amount they can do. But the relief worker has to convert emotional responses into practical action and difficult choices - whom to help and how. Their own feelings have to motivate action for others. But can they separate out their own selfish feelings and prejudices in such an emotive climate? How do they avoid being partial among those they are helping? Are they motivated by altruistic concern, or the power they experience or the attention they receive? Tony Vaux brings over 20 years experience as one of Oxfam's leading emergency managers to the exploration of the conflicts between subjective impulses and objective judgements and the dilemmas relief workers contend with.",

In our interactions with others, we think about how they see us, whether they like us or are impressed by us. We have certain emotions related to this keen awareness of ourselves: we feel embarrassed, remorseful, ashamed, proud, or confident because of things we have done or did not do. We see ourselves as continuous in time: what happened to us in the past affects who we are and what we believe now; we make plans for the future because we believe that the future self will be us and will be affected by our current plan and behavior. Even though we do not have an internal mirror to see ourselves, our every thought seems to revolve around the sense of a self. But what is the self?

After counter-reports of success from those in the field are examined, secular reasons are offered for thinking that these reports are very likely to be unreliable and so lack the power to trump the mountain of evidence for the view that there are precious few who flourish when drawing only on the resources of their own willpower, creativity, and ingenuity. But it’s not due to lack of trying; people want desperately to enjoy happiness and well-being. The real causes of failure, it is argued, are found in the noetic effects of sin—particularly in inordinate self-love and self-deception, but also (especially in those who have been further harmed and humiliated by relentless and systemic oppression) in insufficient self-love and the lack of safety, resources, and opportunities. The tale to be told is not merely a chronicle of failed bids at happiness and well-being ultimately grounded in our shared condition of sin; it is also a tale of the unhappiness that visits so many of those who fall into this pattern of failure. This portion of the story will be informed and structured by the seven capital vices (also known as the seven deadly sins), and it will culminate in a sustained examination and exploration of the sin of sloth.",

But beyond the physical complications lie a group of psychological problems and processes that often get lost or are simply forgotten. My intention here is to remind the reader of some of the problems of transference — briefly explained as a process whereby emotional and physical feelings are transferred from one person to another. Having a greater awareness of them will not take the handicap away. Insight will not make aphasics talk, it will not improve muscle tone and it most certainly will not repair damage that has already been done. But what it may do is provide us with a greater understanding of those we are working with — their families and of course ourselves. By blocking out the possibilities, either consciously or subconsciously, we are in effect fighting against the feelings and emotions. This only serves to complicate issues even further. By at least being open-minded enough in our approach to recognise that transference may be happening, we can leave ourselves with fewer obstacles to inhibit progress.",

We yearn for one life yet blindly live another. Such a gap between being and doing exists in many areas of life, from religion to relationships to career. \r\n\r\nWe can learn much from Lidsky. For he could have let life happen to him, tossing him this way and that, but instead he took control of the rudder, he happened to life.

This infantile amnesia gradually recedes, arguably because other people help children to recover biographical memories by asking questions and offering reminders. Indeed, parents who offer such elaborations—rather than simply quizzing their child about what happened—tend to have children with richer recall of the past. Yet questions and reminders can also be unhelpful. Children can even be led to think about something that never happened and come to think that it actually did. Such false memories underline the ease with which children integrate what they are told with what they observed.",

Whether it take place in the expectation of belief or that of the transference, it is always a re-encounter with an object, a lost Other. Repetition compulsion drives each person to find again the maternal in order to restore lost happiness and escape from disarray and the « uncanny ».\n With the analytic treatment, the compulsion to repeat is above all a refusal to recollect, that is to untangle the past from the scene of present reality. The analyst is not there in propria persona : his role is to enable an encounter with the past, in order to send the past back to the past and be able to live the present.",

Some adolescents talked of having felt a longing to achieve a sense of 'peace and nothingness', and this was their way of undoing their state of painful tension.

      "abstract": "Abstract The account of the crime is nearly always a cover up story. Murder occurs concretely in most cases when it has been committed many times previously in daydreams, nightmares and sometimes in unconscious phantasy that has never become conscious. Before the deed, conscious efforts – sometimes unconscious ones, too – are designed and devoted to keeping the murder encapsulation from action. Then something takes place internally that breaks loose the murderousness from it's cordoned off status, so that the whole of the energies of the individual becomes devoted to enacting the murderous deed. In the death constellation there is a psychically traumatic and indigestible experience to do with death. Only with a life threatening trigger, displayed as the fear of death, did they enact their murderousness. Violence is thus a communication about the patient's belief systems about themselves, about their relationships with others and about their origins. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "When an individual confronts any challenging situationphysical, mental or emotional, couragequality of human strength is revealed.This study relates to the personal experience about camping in wilderness of Eagle Nest Sanctuary of Arunachala Pradesh in India.Both the nature camps were situated amidst dense forest, with conditions such as no power(electricity), freezing weather and water, long dark hours, no medical facility within reach, and canvas tents.Narrative Analysis has been used as a tool to give meaning to this unique individual experience of camping in the nature.Themes such as creativity, courage, resilience, happiness, confidence were emerged as a result of narrative inquiry.It can be concluded that imagery of an experience of confronting challenging situations in the past will be helpful in building self-confidence.For any individual to build and maintain relationships, out-bound activities provides an opportunity to understand group dynamics better.When any individual steps out of comfort zone, learning outcome helps him build confidence and resilience.Ultimately an individual has the freedom and choice to give meaning and context to understand courage.",

      "title": "Perception of the future - from the perspective of adolescents with war experiences",
      "abstract": "War and destruction have marked every family, every child in the war zones and around it. Every community on that district experienced some losts (home, property, death, missing persons, lost ideas, relations, feelings, dreams about the future). Like most of modern wars, in this case civilian targets were the most vulnerable targets. By now we already know many to which these vulnerable groups were exposed during the war and after the war (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and its longterm consequences). The author will deal with some intangible risks in the population of adolescents, concerning two most important tasks of that period: finishing the processes of individuation and separation. What about these tasks when the moments of personal crises (in personal growth and development, such as period of adolescence) appear in the same time as social crises (such as war destruction)? This is exactly the group from which we expect to be grown up soon, and not only to play the roles of adults, but to act as adults as well (and if possible to feel good with that responsibility). According to Jasper (1993.) person often chooses between and (by integrity he means: being sage, independent, authentic, and by cooperation: compromising, imitating, adjusting.... Exposed to a parent's pressure, demand or expectation, child or adolescent would mostly choose to be cooperative (because he/she loves his parents and want to be loved, accepted, and want to meet these expectations as good as possible, even if it means risking and endangering his/hers integrity). If a child or an adolescent if often in a position to hurt or endangered his integrity, he will be in a trouble (he would want to cooperate inspite of unrealistic, overdemanding expectations). These injuries are, unfortunately for most of the parents invisible (not like broken arm or leg, or bleeding nose). Most of adolescents don't talk about these injuries, at least, not verbally. They rather choose to talk through different signals (psychological, physiological). These signals are usual cries for addressed to the adults. If adolescent's significant others do not recognise these signals, or worse, if these signals are interpreted as lack of cooperation and followed by punishment, child could choose to hide them and to express them elsewhere (but not at home). Certainly, by not seeing theme, we will not make them disappear. And what about their integrity, or capability to keep a balance between and cooperation? Are they capable for bringing up for living together, tolerance and non-violence conflict resolution? Should they deny or suppress their feelings of distrust. Are we, as a community ready, open minded and mature enough to help ourselves and our youngsters to get the insight to these experiences and cope with them in order to heal our emotional wounds and get ready for intercultural experiences. According to author's experience this war generation of adolescents was faced with extreem pressure for cooperation, pressure for growing up quickly, overnight, taking care for younger siblings and often for mothers and grandparents, while fathers were absent. In the presentation the author will try to enlight some of these issues according to the experience of training social work students and group work with adolescent refugees.",

In exhorting them to become increasingly more generous, one has not even begun to tackle the problem, for what they need is not exhortation so touch as direction. We should like to indicate here the main lines along which the spiritual life develops in accordance with prudence, in contradistinction to notions which are perhaps currently admitted, but which, in our opinion, have been insufficiently, examined.",

Drawing on trials encountered in personal, professional, and academic settings, I hope to evoke awareness of the challenges faced, and to inform recommendations for support and understanding while allowing individuals to maintain autonomy.

Nothing could be further from the truth! The real battle has only just begun. Even assuming that the tortures of repeated revisions are over (and that is very doubtful at this stage), there is still the matter of publication. I suspect that all of us start our writing careers somewhat naïve on this subject, and the process of learning can be stressful and there is no escaping its realities. Whether we like it or not, we can find ourselves having to satisfy the requirements of a publisher who is concerned about production costs and marketability, or an editor who wants to ‘correct’ our English or a referee who dislikes our ideas. I have known archaeologists who have been so incensed by such reactions to their writing that they have responded by throwing it in a drawer and sulking, in some cases for years rather than months. Instead, one needs either to seek another publication outlet or to grit one's teeth and negotiate the problems as far as possible; compromise can be a great healer. In particular, one must attempt to see the situation from the publisher's, editor's or referee's point of view (Derricourt 1996a, 1996b); one must seriously consider that they might actually be right! Might it be that they are not really trying to consign your work to the inferno but to raise it to celestial heights?",

      "title": "Getting Back in Touch with Students: Should We Risk It?.",
      "abstract": "A student enters your office or classroom and closes door. What's on your mind? you ask. After an awkward pause, student discloses a sensitive problem and begins to cry. You offer a tissue. The student waves you off and claims to be okay, but while explaining problem further breaks down and sobs. You put your arm around student's shoulder and say, Everything will be all right. Chances are, however, that everything may be all wrong, for you and your school district. Without a witness to your act of compassion, and even with one, you could find yourself in a legal bind. Your career could be finished, your personal life undone, and a child's life upended all because of a single, misinterpreted touch. Until this very moment, you might not have given much thought to what you would have done in that situation. Most of us wouldn't think twice about doing what appears to be right thing. However, in light of increasing lawsuits, accusations of molestation, and sensationalized news reports, we might want to start thinking about whether it's ever to touch a student. HANDS OFF, OR ALL HANDS ON DECK? In recent years, there has been great controversy and debate over use of touch in our schools. Some experts claim that appropriate touching should be allowed in special instances (e.g., consoling or praising). Others believe that because of past abuses and current risks of litigation, under no circumstances should adults touch children. Today, trend toward abstaining from touch in schools is growing in direct response to awareness-building and heightened sensitivity toward sexual molestation and abuse that has occurred over past 20 years. In an effort to keep one step ahead of sexual offenders (who are also aware of what we're teaching our children), more and more schools are sending message to adults everywhere, Hands off! It's almost as if touching has become taboo. However, not touching children could be considered another form of abuse-neglect, which may create a whole new set of problems for our children as they wrestle with what is and is not acceptable social behavior. By modeling an aloof interpersonal style and becoming less humanistic with our youth, we may be sending message that violent and aggressive touching (as seen on TV movies, and video games) is acceptable, but hugging or patting someone on back is not. This paradox is like a slap in face of healthy touching. Compounding this issue are laws and ethical codes that interpret touching in vague and sometimes unrealistic ways. For instance, according to Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA), adults in school settings would be best served never to touch students. Other organizations and associations such as ACA and ASCA (1992) neither firmly condemn or condone touching. And although ethical standards like these have established guidelines around inappropriate touching, little attention has been paid to nonerotic contact (Holub & Lee, 1990) and touch. Is it any wonder that most teachers, counselors, and even parents refrain from adding that personal touch to their interactions with children? Many theorists, clinicians, and educators contend that physical contact is critical to human development and is necessary to ensure proper growth. Holub and Lee (1990) also point to studies and research such as that conducted by Field, Schanberg, & that suggest the absence of touching [also] may account for an infant's failure to thrive. Others in community believe that in order to win war on child abuse and molestation, we cannot afford to allow for even slightest ambiguity in what defines and inappropriate touching. Their edict may well be To touch is just too much. This article, then, looks at merits and drawbacks of various approaches to touching and attempts to determine whether we should teach children that some forms of touching are acceptable and even encouraged. …",

This case is about one such young entrepreneur, who motivated by the success of his role model, launches an enterprise only to see it wither away in quick time. In trying to understand why it happened, we trace the entrepreneurs’ background, the antecedents of his taking the entrepreneurial route and the reasons why the enterprise could not be sustained. We also make an attempt to see if the failure of the first shot at entrepreneurship deters an individual to start another one.",

The right to look is not about merely seeing. It begins at a personal level with the look into someone else’s eyes to express friendship, solidarity, or love. That look must be mutual, each inventing the other, or it fails. As such, it is un-representable. The right to look claims autonomy, not individualism or voyeurism, but the claim to a political subjectivity and collectivity: “the right to look. The invention of the other.”",

So especially, in a competing, stressful contemporary times, one needs stable selfobject more than ever. And affirmative emotions, such as gladness or joy are essential sources to keep selfobject stable and calm. And there are levels about the state of happiness, gladness and joy. If a man seek happiness only in possessing materials, his self is likely to lose inner peace easily when he fails to get something he want, materially. But if a man pursue gladness, including mental and spiritual level, his self is not likely to lose inner peace so easily. In this light, christians can experience profound and deep peace and inner joy, than non-christians, with the help of the calming structure of the presence of God in his self. Jesus shows the truly and dedicated empathic role to whomever he meets, by letting them enjoy inner joy by experiencing the presence of God, so they can have cohesive self. Pastoral counselors are to play their roles, as helpers in letting clients have the calming structure of selves, through experiencing the presence of God, following Jesus Christ who shows the most dedicated model.",

      "abstract": "I remember taking a communication course during my early undergrad years. course title was Interpersonal Communication and was taught by one of the professors from the Speech Communication Department. One of the basic aspects taught in the course was the concept of labeling. We are probably well aware of how humans assign labels to aggregate groups; humans have the attribute of using our intelligence to quickly size up a situation, and put our perceptions into some category, in order to respond to the need of the moment. This may be a healthy or unhealthy response to the context of how labeling is used. We are also symbol-making beings; it's very nice to be able to think quickly and place a person, group, object, or place into a neat little bundle with a comfortable spot in a box with a label on it. We humans don't do well with a lot of uncertainty in our lives or in the world out there. capacity of acting quickly in a threatening situation is an inherent survival skill. Each of us has acquired specific survival patterns that eventually motivate themselves into a kind of reactive repertoire. The awkwardness and paranoia that ensues from the uninvestigated assumptions that we associate with particular labels, is, in itself a major cause of breakdown in communication and a source of destructive responses to conflict. (1) I remember once seeing an animated video that graphically depicted how we humans box ourselves in by the labels we put on ourselves and others. star of this video was a strange-looking little creature (I'm not quite sure whether he should get the label of human or not), inside a generic, cardboard box, and he was frantically attempting to find a way out. He would put his feet on one side and push until he was red in the face, and I had some concerns that he might be prone to a heart attack while in the confines of his small home, a little box. He tried everything of which he could think as a way to solve his problem: using feet, hands, arms, and even trying to break out through the seams. He was doing so much work in there that the walls of the box were breathing in and out like a mini hurricane. Eventually he found a space, but he had to flatten himself, the best he could, to squeeze himself out; he got a foot and an arm out, but the other side couldn't find the moxie to follow the leader--the rest of his body! At long last with excruciating alacrity and grit, he popped out. ironic end of this cartoon tale was that after he finally got out, he began to feel sad that he was no longer in the box. He'd grown accustomed to it, and missed the inside, because it had morphed into his real home. He was grieving the loss of his former home. After crying for a while, and feeling sorry for himself, he decided he would go back inside--going back was just as hard as getting out, but ultimately he reached his goal. He sat in the box and smiled to himself--like the cat that ate the canary--he felt so satisfied to be in familiar environs. He was at last home. It's my opinion that this little cautionary tale reflects both the views of Buddhism and general semantics and one example, the Buddhist teaching of the principle of inaction: this doesn't mean that no one ever does anything and simply sits down all our day on the meditation cushion. Rather, it means that we work at detaching from our own ego that wishes to take action all the time, gets the big head over his or her action, and strives to get whatever she/he needs to meet the ego's desires, cravings, addictions, obsessions with materialistic objects, and conditioned attachments. Most of us are very attached to fixing some problem or controlling some situation. Inaction is the antidote for this. Albeit it's not action or inaction that ought to concern us, but it's our attachment to ourselves {our ego} which emerges as an obstacle. box metaphor is a good one to describe the evaluative process. …",

      "abstract": "We live more and more of our lives online; we rely on the internet as we work, correspond with friends and loved ones, and go through a multitude of mundane activities like paying bills, streaming videos, reading the news, and listening to music. Without thinking twice, we operate with the understanding that the data that traces these activities will not be abused now or in the future. There is an abstract idea of privacy that we invoke, and, concrete rules about our privacy that we can point to if we are pressed. Nonetheless, too often we are uneasily reminded that our privacy is not invulnerable-the data tracks we leave through our health information, the internet and social media, financial and credit information, personal relationships, and public lives make us continuously prey to identity theft, hacking, and even government surveillance. A great deal is at stake for individuals, groups, and societies if privacy is misunderstood, misdirected, or misused. Popular understanding of privacy doesn’t match the heat the concept generates, though understandably. With a host of cultural differences as to how privacy is understood globally and in different religions, and with ceaseless technological advancements, it is an increasingly slippery and complex topic. In this clear and accessible book, Leslie and John G. Francis guide us to an understanding of what privacy can mean and why it is so important. Drawing upon their extensive joint expertise in law, philosophy, political science, regulatory policy, and bioethics, they parse the consequences of the forfeiture, however great or small, of one’s privacy.",

But if I raise the question as to who or how I am, there are three salient profiles in which I can cast myself, three selves with which we can identify. I can see myself just as an agent identified over time by the linkages between my experiences, my attitudes and my actions. I can see myself as the persona that I invite others to rely on and that, if sincere, I internalize. And I can see myself as the figure I cut in other people's eyes, whether or not I welcome that image. Such ambiguities help explain the complexity in philosophical discussion of the self as well as the conflict in everyday exhortations to be ourselves and know ourselves, yet also to forget ourselves and lose ourselves.",

      "abstract": "Overthinking merupakan sebuah kecenderungan pada seseorang dalam memikirkan suatu skenario, permasalahan, atau kejadian dengan durasi yang berlebihan dan tanpa henti. Orang yang mengalami overthinking sering kali terperangkap dalam siklus berpikir yang berulang, fokus pada setiap detail, menganalisa skenario tentang kemungkinan terburuk, meragukan keputusan sendiri, dan kesulitan menghentikan atau mengalihkan isi pikiran mereka kepada hal lain. Dalam buku self healing \"Overthinking is my hobby, and I hate it\" karya Alvi Syahrin membahas berbagai hal yang sering kali dipikirkan secara berlebihan oleh orang-orang terlebih remaja akhir yang memasuki masa transisi menuju dewasa. Hal-hal seperti hubungan dengan orang lain, pendidikan, karir, dan sebagainya merupakan persoalan umum yang dipikirkan dan dibahas dengan cukup baik dalam buku ini. Namun tidak semua orang menikmati kegiatan membaca buku terutama dengan perkembangan sosial media yang semakin pesat, orang-orang cenderung lebih menyukai media visual seperti gambar dan video yang bisa dilihat dengan waktu yang singkat. Setelah dilakukan pengamatan untuk mendapatkan kesimpulan dan solusi berkaitan dengan upaya penyebaran informasi dari buku self healing tersebut menggunakan metode 5W+2H, bisa ditarik kesimpulan bahwa komik merupakan media yang belakangan ini mengalami peningkatan pada peminat yang terutama berasal dari kalangan anak muda, ditambah dengan semakin mudahnya penyebaran informasi di sosial media seperti Instagram, X atau Twitter, Tiktok, dan semacamnya. Solusi yang pada akhirnya diputuskan untuk dipergunakan adalah komik strip. Komik strip merupakan solusi yang dipilih karena merupakan media visual yang simpel, menarik perhatian, juga bisa dilihat dengan waktu yang singkat. Dengan menggunakan Instagram sebagai media penyebaran informasi, diharapkan informasi tersebut bisa menjangkau target secara lebih luas dari sebelumnya.

These stories run from the sublime to the ridiculous, the ecstatic to the elegaic, the hopeful to the fearful and the marvellous to the mundane. Only in our fantasies are we anywhere near free to indulge our dramatic imaginings to their fullest: even then we are not entirely free for we must dream within the historic experience of our life stories. In life, we are thrust into a work-in-progress. It is a sprawling performance that has countless scenes and a profusion of acts, often being performed simutaneously and repeatedly. Reality becomes congruent with these enactments of the habitual stories and stock tales of the community. To the extent that we get to write and enact our own lives, we must begin with and respond to the dramatic plot in which we find ourselves. The story of my life can never be disentangled from the community's story in which my story develops and gains significance. While we can never be free of the past or of our communal connections, we need not become slavish adherents to their perceived weight and hold. The future of the past is our present and continuing responsibility. The past has passed and was what it was, but it is up to us to decide what it will become.",

      "abstract": "Suicide is a controversial phenomenon that people of different cultures and even of different epochs have had difficulty naming.It used to be an enduring theme of many medical, psychological, philosophical, and moralistic discussions.It is a paradoxical act of ultimate self-destruction, a flight from life to death.To commit suicide is to overcome the fear of personal death and to make a step into nothingness.Such a desperately brave deed requires an abandonment of one's sense of immortality, which we all have, a change of values and worldviews.But if one's suicide attempt proves unsuccessful, the question becomes how to explain to oneself and others one's recent act of self-violence.To discover these explanations, we conducted a study of 319 people, ranging in age from 18 to 25; they were all either students (n = 156) or patients in an emergency toxicology ward (people who had attempted to poison themselves, n = 163).This article summarizes theories of suicidal behavior and of the fear of death together with the ideas of cultural anthropologist E. Becker on these matters and puts suicide into the terror-management perspective.The suicidal act is viewed as a mortality salience, and the hypothesis is that people who deny their recent suicide attempt (n = 33) and who have one (n = 95) or several (n = 35) suicide attempts in their personal history exhibit different terror-management patterns in comparison with each other and with the control group.They fall back on different resources with various degrees of effectiveness.Implications of these results for understanding suicidal and postsuicidal behavior are discussed and suggestions for rehabilitation are made.",

But not all forms of grief have this temporal structure, for we can also grieve prospectively, in advance of an actual or expected loss. So-called 'anticipatory grief' is most often discussed in the context of those caring for the elderly or terminally ill. In this paper, however, I consider self-directed anticipatory grief. Specifically, I argue that grieving in anticipation of one's own terminal absence ('self-mourning') is an important, albeit often neglected, form of death awareness.",

      "title": "Context Building and Educating Imaginative Engagement",
      "abstract": "Context Building and Educating Imaginative Engagement David E. W. Fenner (bio) Introduction In my experience—with students, colleagues, friends, myself—I find that most people view aesthetic objects and art objects (which sometimes overlap but not always) through a variety of \"lenses\": subjectively located, psychologically based perspectives or \"contexts\" through which the object is viewed, considered, appreciated, and many times even criticized. I believe that many times the depth and richness of aesthetic reward depends on the perspective through which the subject attends to an object or event. While a part of aesthetic perspectival context is objective—such as the physical conditions surrounding and history concerning the aesthetic object—the majority of it is subjective, and I want to take another step and say that the majority is psychological.1 Aesthetic attenders bring to aesthetic experiences thick sets of background beliefs, personal associations, taste preferences, attitudes, and values—and this is not to mention the more temporal items like how they feel on the day or whether they are attending alongside friends, relatives, or colleagues. Hundreds of psychological factors result in differences in aesthetic experience; this is most likely true of all experiences, but it is even more the case in aesthetic experience and those kinds of experiences that set the occasions for attenders to think, feel, consider, spend time with, introspect, and be in a relationship—subject and object—that is distinct from the ordinary and the routine. Attenders can employ a single lens or multiple ones. It is entirely possible to attend in the absence of the employment of any lens—a purely disinterested or purely formalist perspective would be such a thing—but the vast majority of aesthetic attenders bring with them layers of lenses through which they naturally, nontheoretically (which is not to say noncognitively) view objects. On different occasions, given particular objects and particular subjects, the subject may view an aesthetic object from an art historical [End Page 109] perspective (whether or not the object is an art object); a moral perspective; a cultural, political, or national perspective; a social, class, race, ethnic, or gender perspective; a religious or spiritual point of view; an emotional point of view; a point of view colored by personal associations, personal history, personal identification, personal preference; and on and on.2 Sometimes the employment of lenses is distracting, and sometimes the experience is less than positive given such employment. But (1) many times—I want to say most times—the employment of such lenses results in a richer and more meaningful experience, and (2) it is the natural stance. Adopting a noncontextualized perspective requires conscious volitional effort. Seeing through particular psychological lenses is the default. I want to focus in this paper on a kind of perspective, a kind of psychological context, that has not been much discussed: I will call it aesthetic engagement preparation. Essentially, this has to do with the level of readiness that the subject possesses for engaging with particular objects aesthetically. To engage in a way that will provide a good return on her investment of attention, the subject must be open to the object, must be comfortable with the objective context, must be ready to enter into a relationship with the object—a relationship that may be psychologically associational in all sorts of ways (affectively, cognitively, and so forth)—and must be ready to employ a range of lenses, like the ones described above, to get the most out of her experience. Again, those who advocate noncontextualized (disinterested or formalist) approaches—Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Addison, Kant, Schopenhauer, Wilde, Whistler, Wimsatt, Greenberg, Brooks, Wolfflin, Bell, Moore, Bullough, Hanslick, Ortega y Gassett, Fry, Hampshire, Stolnitz, and Zangwill, just to name a few—will find aesthetic engagement preparation not only unnecessary but counterproductive. However, given its efficacy for enhancing actual aesthetic experience, I take this as a sign that these noncontextualists may have been on the wrong path. But of course this is an empirical question, and certainly there are cases—though rare, I claim—where employment of aesthetic lenses results in a less positive experience than otherwise. What I will try to do in this paper is to demonstrate (1) the scope of aesthetic engagement preparation on...",

      "abstract": "Abstract A phenomenology of illness-experience is constructed from Sophocles' play Philoctetes. Having suffered a foul-smelling foot wound, the hero is exiled to a desolate island. So, too, does the seriously ill person suffer a three-fold exile: from the cosmos, the body, and the social world. The sick person may feel the cosmos as punishing or meaningless. One is brought home to a heightened awareness of one's body, but discovers it as a body in which one no longer feels at home—that is, as a threat and cause of suffering. To fall sick is also to be banished from the daily routines of our conventional identity. We experience exile from the social world. Others cannot experience or relieve our pain, and may turn away from us in fear or revulsion. All this is portrayed in Philoctetes, but so too is the redemptive power of compassion, which ultimately saves the hero from exile. The importance of social support in assisting the process of healing and re-integration and is thus demonstrated in rich literary terms.",

We live our lives in the in-between, experiencing some joy while at the same time facing challenges—be they personal, familial, economic, or even national—that elicit feelings of anxiety and trepidation.

In the United States, the use of descriptive words like dead, died, death, and dying is almost nonexistent when we discuss someone who has died. Only after repeatedly shouting out the words are they able to desensitize themselves and continue with a discussion of the reasons for their difficulty. Words like death, dead or died are so final sounding yet are comforting to some people. Bereaved persons may be comfortable using these words when people who offer condolences also feel comfortable using them. Mourners tend to feel and act differently during each of the ongoing phases of the grief process. As their feelings and actions change over time, their needs will also change.

In working with clients, it is common to observe barriers they encounter, such as, multiple relationship strains, drug and alcohol addictions, and mental health issues, to name a few. A social work student is also held down, due to a lack of work related experiences which may create negative emotions. The art piece I have created identifies these factors and the attendant burdens.",

      "title": "My Philosophy of Teaching American History",
      "abstract": "My Philosophy of Teaching American History Bob Rinehart As American history educators, we are responsible for our actions both in and out of our school environment. Through our actions, we show our morality to everyone with whom we have relationships. For educational success [End Page 79] to occur, educators must explore and discover their personal relationship with themselves. Once this has happened, they may begin to explore and discover their relationship with their students. I agree with this statement from Moral Crisis in the Schools—What Parents and Teachers Need to Know: “A teacher cannot share the meaning of a world of knowledge, unless and until he or she has courageously reached within to discover the real self, the underlying values, drives and principles convictions and even emotions that conspire to make the teacher the unique and genuine person who is ready and willing to share a portion of life with students. A teacher at any level cannot convincingly present a world of meaning, if he or she presents himself or herself as a person devoid of meaning.”1 Teaching is a “moral enterprise” and necessarily involves the development of conscience. All teachers/educators need to be connected with every influential environment in their lives. They must use these environments to help their students understand the importance of books, historical data, and scientific discoveries to propel us through the twenty-first century—with a craving for knowledge that meets our conscience sense of morality. Next is my personal philosophy for being a successful American history teacher. First, always let your students know that you are passionate about the curriculum you are teaching. You do not have to announce that you are passionate; they should be able to pick this up from your actions. Second, make your curriculum relevant to your students. Use stories from today to connect to your American history timeline. Finally, bring students to a location that connects to your American history curriculum. Once you are at the site, have a scavenger hunt or some type of relevant work for them to accomplish as a group. Review this information with them over the next few days in class. Don’t just take them on a field trip and have them run wild and get nothing educational from the trip. (This last point comes after having witnessed some less-than-productive Gettysburg field trips taken by other schools.) Finally, I have three pieces of advice for beginning American history teachers. First, master your classroom. If you cannot maintain proper classroom management, the students will not learn the curriculum. Second, give respect; get respect. Do not try to be students’ friends. To provide a proper learning environment for all students, you must maintain your teacher/facilitator [End Page 80] identity. Finally, have fun every day, because you are getting the opportunity to educate the next generation about American history and how to be an engaged citizen. To conclude, the following chart showcases one example of how the Civil War could be incorporated across multiple disciplines in one school. TEACHING OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR Time frame American Civil War connection October–November • Language arts teacher—Civil War Literature—Ambrose Bierce, “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge” and Ann Rinaldi, “Girl in Blue.” • Another subject area teacher—Civil War In 4 videos by the Civil War Trust and the movie Gone with the Wind. • Science teacher—engineering during the American Civil War packet; this includes balsa-wood bridge-building. • Social studies teacher—H.S.I.—Historic Scene Investigation: “Growing Up before They Had to—Children of the Civil War” (includes primary source materials from children—obtained from an online source and tweaked by Mr. Rinehart); various Civil War Trust videos (summarized by students) and Civil War Trust 360 battlefield panoramas (summarized by students) January Research individual student American Civil War trifold projects: In the computer lab—during our instruction and enrichment period—trifold projects are due at the end of March A Saturday in late March Applebee’s pancake breakfast fundraiser: Proceeds go to help fund battlefield preservation and service learning.

      "title": "Thriving After Trauma",
      "abstract": "Thriving After Trauma addresses readers who have experience trauma or loss due to a variety of experience – whether accident, abuse, or injury. Shari Botwin shows readers, through personal stories, how many who have experienced the worst kinds of trauma have managed to move on and thrive beyond their experiences. Often, those who live through trauma come away with feelings of shame, guilt, anger, and despair. These are common, even normal, responses in the immediate aftermath. Left unaddressed, though, those feelings may develop into substance abuse problems, eating disorders, depression, or anxiety. Learning how to move on, to pick up and live life again, takes effort and guidance. Botwin guides readers through the stories of others who have gone on to live fulfilling, happy lives, and provides tips and tools for healing and moving on. Letting go of the shame, guilt, anger and fear associated with tragic events is crucial to reclaiming a full life. Strategies such as, journaling, mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral restructuring, and healthy relationships to aid in recovery are explored and explained, so readers can adopt those strategies that work best for them. It is not the trauma itself that results in so many people developing self-destructive tendencies and life threatening illnesses. It is the lack of having a way to digest and make sense of the trauma-related feelings that can lead one to mental illness, disconnection, and in some cases, even death. Readers will learn how to live with the trauma versus how to get over the trauma, so they can move forward healthfully and mindfully.",

      "title": "Why is P Afraid to Love a Woman",
      "abstract": "Man is only animal that blushes--or needs to. --Mark Twain Many individuals suffer from social anxiety of one type or another. dictionary defines anxiety as state of being uneasy, apprehensive, or worried about what may happen; concern about a possible future event (Keans & Maloney 22). There are indefinite types of anxiety. type of anxiety that will be discussed presently will be a sort of dating anxiety. subject of discussion is a young man who suffers aforementioned affliction. He will provide us with a case study, and hopefully, as we learn about his disorder, we will help him to overcome his difficulty. He is not alone in uneasiness he feels when a beautiful woman smiles in his direction, or when he feels someone who he cares for getting too close to him. That uneasiness is a Generalized Social Phobia (Scheiner & Welkowitz, 1996). Franklin Scheiner, M.D., and Lawrence Welkowitz, Ph.D., in their book Hidden Face of Shyness: Understanding and Overcoming Social (1996), describe symptoms that characterize this most peculiar type of social anxiety disorder. doctors relay story of Jerry. Jerry suffered from Dating Anxiety until he recognized that it was a serious problem and sought help. During his affliction, Jerry loved women but due to his demand for a date to be perfect, as well as his thinking that a perfect woman would probably reject him, he did not dare to date (Scheiner & Welkowitz 42). We can see from looking at Jerry that persons suffering from social anxiety disorders have much more to lose from not taking their perceived risks than from taking a risk and failing at their endeavors. Jerry's story is much like that of subject of present study. Our subject, whom we will term or simply P, is suffering from dating anxiety. Self P has not suffered from much anxiety over years. There were instances where some anxiety was present, but by and large P considered himself ready for anything. In college, P realized all at once, by a sort of concurrence of circumstances, that there was some emotional disorder present that was keeping him from healthy emotional relationships with women. He was finding that he could not feel comfortable when meeting a woman to whom he found himself attracted. He also felt awkward when trying to move forward in a situation from acquaintance to friendship, and from friendship to romance. Jerry also reported that he was concerned about seeming too interested in someone, or in sex (Scheiner & Welkowitz, 1996). P was finding that more often this state of affairs occurred, more he realized that there must be something inside himself that was causing this dysfunction. At this point, before delving more into anxiety or uneasiness in social situations, some very important issues regarding social construction of self should be mentioned. This will be important, because without it a good understanding of problem of dating (or of any anxiety) cannot be gained. Problems involving an uneasy feeling in given situations must be a result of a defective element in P's self-image. Though this defective self-image may not be dominant over all areas of his life, it may control a certain element sufficiently enough to cause discontent in his life. As individuals, we have right to solve our problems and end our discontent. Charles Cooley was an economist who also greatly contributed to what is known today as Sociological Psychology. In his article excerpted under title The Self as Sentiment and Reflection, (2001) Cooley posits theory that self is result of one's viewing oneself through eyes of a fellow human being. He posits further that a person bases his/her actions, as well as his/her self opinion, on subsequent feelings that an individual would have as a result of that judgement. He states that there are three stages to this process: the imagination of our appearance to other person; imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification (Cooley 17). …",

      "abstract": "I am associating Privacy with “Do not disturb, I want to be left alone”. On the face of it, this is an egoistical anti-social standpoint. But is there anything that can be said for being anti-community? In this paper, for the sake of argument, I align myself with this attitude because from this position I can make certain observations and raise questions related to the other. Whether we like it or not, the mood of the day favours privacy rather than community. Individual privacy is more and more sought and jealously guarded.For many people community is bad news. It evokes a sense of restriction and narrowness rather than openness, conflict rather than harmony .One has only to think of, Islamic community, Serbian community, Protestant community, Roman Catholic community, David Koresh’s community at Waco, the European Community—all these give out negative signals. Even ‘basic community’ has echoes of an in-group and can be seen as a form of protest or elitism. Sometimes it seems as if the only communities that have any popular appeal are fictional ones like Ambridge or Coronation Street. These are fanciful, idealistic creations, real life is much more grim. Survival depends on individual effort. This rejection of community is often the result of its failure to satisfy our needs or its degeneration into such positions as extreme nationalism. But a denial of community often leads to a sense of isolation and loneliness. We can note that both the 1991 General Household Survey of the U.K. (published in 1993 and the recent Report into European Lifestyles by MINTEL draw attention to the fact that over a quarter of all British homes are single person households and about 14% of households are people living alone.",

      "title": "What Drives a Teenager to Depression? an Insider's Sociological Look into Its Causes Melissa Mejia",
      "abstract": "One of the most important stages of our lives is adolescence. We go through so many changes, and not only does our body change but so does the way we think. At some point in our lives we become so obsessed with what others think of us that we live trying to please others. But the truth is that we can never fully please anybody because we cannot read minds. What we do is live and act according to our own perception of how others see us. With this looking-glass self (Cooley 26-30) we form images of oneself through what we consider to be someone else's perspective. In the end this is just an extension of how we see ourselves. We focus so much on pleasing others that we forget about our own desires and need. At this point we start a void that can lead to depression. This has happened to various teenagers not only in the U.S. but also around the world. I include myself in this group of teenagers. I suffered from depression when I was 14 years old. At that time I lived in my country of origin, which is the Dominican Republic. At that time I didn't know that I had suffered from depression until several years later. My family found out also several years later. Nobody in my family knew at that time. It all started when my mom had to come to the U.S. to because we were in a tight financial situation. My dad had to take care of me and my brother, who is one year younger than I am. My dad also had to so he didn't spend much time at home. Even though I had friends, we didn't see each other outside of school very often, and more often than not I felt lonely. I did a lot of work (Hochschild 51-56) in my adolescence. My intention was to change not only the way I displayed feelings but also the very core of that feeling. I'll mention one occasion in which I used emotion work: I went to a friend's birthday party and whoever saw me there would've thought that I was very happy, but my true was sadness, because that exact day was the three month anniversary of my mom's departure to the U.S. I felt like crying but nobody knew that. And not only did I try to appear happy but I actually managed to feel happy for a moment because of my emotion work. Note that I was in changing my actual to happiness, but this doesn't mean that the outcome is always successful. As Hochschild emphasizes, note that 'emotion work' refers to the effort--the act of trying--and not the outcome, which may or may not be successful (53). Why did I think that I needed to be happy at this birthday party? Who said that I can't be sad when I feel like it? This display of an emotion that you do not feel is based on feeling (Hochschild 5156), which are the rules of what you are supposed to feel in a given place or situation. A good example is the birthday scene I gave above. And these rules seem to govern how people try or try not to feel in ways 'appropriate to the situation' (Hochschild 52). The fact that I appear to be happy at this birthday party when I'm not is not only caused by rules but also by sociological mindfulness (Schwalbe 3-6). I showed happiness not only because I was supposed to, but also because I was being mindful of my friend's feelings; I thought, wouldn't she worry if she saw me with a sad face? Going back to emotion work, I think that my emotion is related to how Will, of the movie Good Will Hunting, felt, because he used emotion to hide his true feelings, and he did this so efficiently that he himself actually believed he felt that specific way, when he actually felt a totally different way. But as the movie reached its end, Will realized what his true emotions were. I've always been a very good student, and my parents, specifically my father, have always been very proud. Since I always had good grades there came a point in time when my parents just expected those good grades from me, when those grades became something normal, something that just had to happen. …",

      "title": "Kriteria Sukses Dalam Al-Qur’an (Kajian Tematik)",
      "abstract": "One of the biggest dreams in every human life is success, because success is a reference for assessing one another's perspective. Everyone has their own views on the definition of success. Some consider people to be successful if they have a lot of wealth, but not others. Some make popularity as a reference for success and so on. However, as Muslim people who stick to the Qur'an, they should not only make a measure of success while living in the world, but also prepare and fight for life in the Hereafter in order to become a human being who always lives in success both while still living on earth and later in the Hereafter. A person's journey to success is not the same as a short process and he has achieved what he aspires to. And there are also those who have to go through a long process, starting from a failed experiment and then getting up and stepping back so that it only ushers in the success he wants to achieve. However, if done with persistence, strong desire and sacrifice then Allah Almighty. will bring a much better life as well. Although the achievement of success is very subjective, but not infrequently for humans, especially Muslims, do not know the nature of success contained in the Qur'an. Is success only motivated by the achievement of desires, happiness and comfort in life? Or the equanimity felt while living life? Or is there even the meaning of success itself contained in the Qur'an?&#x0D; This research wants to answer about the meaning of success contained in the Qur'an. What does the word success mean in the Qur'an? And what are the criteria for success according to the Qur'an? This research is a type of library research (Library Research), which is a research technique that focuses on literature and books - open reading by examining the content of what has been read. The data analysis technique used is a descriptive analysis technique, which is to systematically describe the facts or characteristics of certain populations or fields factually and carefully and conceptually examine the existing data and then classified according to the problem in question to obtain clarity.&#x0D; In this study the author found three successful terms in the Qur'an, namely al-Falah, an-Najah and al-Fauz. Although linguistically it has the same meaning, namely luck or success, each word has a different use. The word al-Falah describes the meaning of the luck of the world as well as the hereafter, The word an-Najah describes the meaning of world luck alone and the word al-Fauz describes the meaning of luck later in the afterlife. Success verses in the Qur'an are very diverse and varied, from the research that has been done, the author found an explanation of the criteria for successful people. These criteria generally state that people who want to succeed in this world and the Hereafter must have the criteria mentioned in the Qur'an including believing and devotion to Allah swt., performing prayers five times, praying to Allah swt. Be active in working, set aside some sustenance for people in need, faith and piety, pray to Allah swt., get mercy so that they go to heaven.",

      "abstract": "Bereavement typically begins with acute grief, a period immediately after a loss, in which the bereaved person experiences feelings, thoughts, or behaviors that are painful and uncomfortable. As early as 1944, Lindeman wrote about the type of grief that does not follow a natural or typical trajectory. He used terms such as pathological grief, morbid grief reactions, delayed grief, and chronic grief. Worden utilized similar terms, specifically: chronic grief reactions, delayed grief reactions, exaggerated grief reactions, and masked grief reactions. Worden describes masked grief reactions as experiencing symptoms or behaviors that can be maladaptive, impairing, or causing difficulty but not identified by the griever as related to their loss. The story of Bruce Wayne, from Batman Begins, takes place in the fictional Gotham City, where Bruce was born into a family of extreme wealth. Bruce's approach to coping fits well into the paradigm identified by Dr. William Worden as one style of abnormal grief reactions – specifically masked grief.",

Losers, waste of space, failure, scum, pathetic and financial drain are but a few of the favoured impressions given bold presentation through various forms of media. As emotive opinions for those of my ilk, such impassioned perspective gives me pause to consider how an entire community can earn this intense and often (to my perspective) an almost compulsive ire. Nevertheless, these are long held impressions that have followed the homeless community since the dawn of society. I find it ironic that homelessness predates social intolerance on an historic, if not biblical, plane but I cannot set aside a potential concept that homeless individuals are frequently being viewed to spring full grown with varying degrees of physical and psychological complications while little thought is given to any mitigating circumstances resulting in their current standard of living.",

We could also ask what it is to be a person, as to ask what workmanship is ? Craftsmanship stimulatingly affects us, it stirs the faculties, it invigorates the mind, causes us to feel profound feelings and it makes us think in another manner. Workmanship has its impacts too on enthusiastic life as in the psychological and scholarly upgrade. A further meaning of craftsmanship may prompt an explanation that workmanship is accomplishments, items or exercises with which we attempt to alert others to similar encounters, sentiments and feelings that we have survived ourselves. This is normally done by utilizing the faculties to find the core interest. The faculties and tactile, eidetic or sense insight based encounters are in a vital situation to clarify the substance of craftsmanship. A person is constantly looking for a reaching surface to the real world and fact (so to state genuine world) through his own hands, by contacting and by doing assignments by hand.

Winner of the 2018 New American Press Fiction Prize, How to Walk on Water is chock full of how people can be, how their extraordinary ways and peculiar behaviors (some of which push hard against though never break the boundaries of belief) are ultimately understandable and endearing because they are borne out of the most ordinary of desires — a need for love, for belonging, to find a kind of company to keep. These are lovely and surprising stories, bound together by an exploration of the slippery slope of identity, what it means to be who you are, who you think you are, or who you are meant to be or even wanting to be. In “Felina,” a mysterious, seemingly dangerous woman, who identifies herself as Felina Jones, Visualist, and claims she can “arrange a woman’s hair to resemble a waterfall or a parking garage,” is pursued by a seemingly buttoned-up investment banker, Arthur, and in the awkward ways they approach each other, both characters struggle to live in and up to the fictions they have created for themselves. Lynette, in “The Only Thing Missing Was the Howling of Wolves,” has kidnapped her two-year old grandson from daycare because his parents haven’t had him baptized; she tells her brother — an unwitting accomplice — that she is part of “the underground baptismal railroad” in fact, the “Mother of the Railroad” and that someday people are going to write about her. This is how people can be in the mesmerizing universe of Swearingen’s collection, haunted and hopeful, confident and terrified, unsure and absolutely certain. All of Swearingen’s characters are invested in their strong devotion to what they believe is or can be true and the dedication to their convictions is so steadfast that it is almost heroic because of the odds that are against them. Although in many ways the characters could not be more different from one another, something that unites them all is a shared dwelling in illusion. Felina trusts in the myth of her own art-making; Lynette believes in the mirage of saving her grandchild, but it is Vera, in “Notes to a Shadowy Man,” whose devotion to the illusion that films provide is the thing that simultaneously sustains and undoes her. An au pair to two-year old Raffi, Vera’s loves movies and especially loves the powder room of a café she frequents in the neighborhood because it allows her to imagine her own life is a film: The marquee lights spiral and she imagines herself cut by vertical lines of shadow and light. She casts her eyes down to Raffi and pretends he is Bogart’s Marlowe.... “So you’re a private detective. I didn’t know they existed except in books.” Raffi coos and she crouches down from her stool and nuzzles into his face. “Silly Vera,” she says to him. “Silly, silly, Vera.” The power of Vera’s illusions lead to a series of startling events and as she is flying back to her home in England, she looks down on the ground and is certain Raffi will come home “because she left him a letter in the café powder room, pressed in an envelope.” A secret she trusts will lead to a happy ending, just like in the movies. Many of the main characters in these stories also have in common troubled pasts: drugs, madness, therapy, violence but the reader is saved from despair by the characters...",

      "title": "Fear, Denial, and Sensible Action in the Face of Disasters",
      "abstract": "Elliot Aronson Fear, Denial, and Sensible Action in the Face of Disasters I MUST BEGIN THIS ESSAY WITH A CONFESSION: I AM NOT AN EXPERT on disasters. I have not studied disasters directly, nor do I know m uch about the m ajor differences am ong various kinds of disasters. W hat I do know som ething about is how the hum an m ind works; how people think, feel, and behave in a wide variety of complex situations (Aronson, 1999, 2008; Tavris and Aronson, 2007). To the extent th at this knowledge may apply to disasters, I suspect that it will be useful in helping people respond rationally to avoid falling victim to a disas­ ter (for example, by im m unizing themselves from infection during a pandemic), or to prepare themselves for an inevitable disaster (like a hurricane), or to respond sensibly to a disaster (like an act of terrorism) once it occurs. After spending the past 50 years doing experim ents on hum an behavior, I am convinced th at people do not often behave in a rational manner. That is, our behavior frequently fails to conform to that of the \"rational actor\" in economic forecasts—m uch to the consternation of m ost economists and policymakers (see Kahneman and Tversky, 1984, 1996). Human behavior is not always rational, but it is fathomable. And, to the extent that we can understand the variables that produce ratio­ nal and irrational behavior, we can find ways to help people make m ore sensible decisions. In the arena of \"how people respond to disasters,\" such an understanding will save lives. social research Vol 75 : No 3 : Fall 2008 855 Specifically, the question I w ant to raise is this: How can we use our knowledge of how the m ind works to help people act in ways that can prevent the disaster, prepare for it or, at the veiy least, help them respond to a disaster in ways that will reduce its impact? To answer this question, I begin w ith the em otion of fear. How do people respond w hen they are frightened? If there is a disaster in the offing (say, a terrorist attack, a hurricane, or a pandemic) and a policym aker w ants people to follow a particular course of action to save their lives, should he or she scare them ? If so, would it be m ore effective to induce a great deal of fear? Or m ight a great deal of fear be overwhelming? W ould inducing a low or m oderate am ount of fear be m ore effective? These are vital questions th at any official at the national, state, and local level interested in curtailing the damage inflicted by disasters should know about. Fortunately, data are avail­ able on this issue. Let me begin w ith two stories. In 1741, the distinguished American theologian Jonathan Edwards delivered a series of lectures throughout New England in w hich he vividly described the torm ents of hell that awaited all sinners who were unredeemed. He told his audiences that, in order to escape the ravages of hell, they m ust give over their lives to Jesus. Eyewitness accounts indicate that the sermons left the congrega­ tions swooning and \"breathing of distress and weeping.\" The records show that, wherever Edwards preached, thousands gave over their lives to Christ as part of the Great Awakening of eighteenth-centuiy America. Some of today's skeptics m ight not regard hellfire as a realistic disaster, but for a believer in eighteenth-centuiy New England, the threat of hell was very real, and w hat could be a greater catastrophe than to spend all of eternity having your flesh m elted by its unbearable fires? Jonathan Edwards dem onstrated that scaring the hell out of people is an effective way to induce people to act in w hat they perceive as being in their own best interests. Some 245 years later, two social psychologists inform ed UCLA college freshmen, during their orientation week, that m ost experts were 856 social research convinced that there was a high probability of an earthquake in the Los Angeles area during...",

      "title": "Learning from our lives",
      "abstract": "We live and learn. Like so many popular sayings, this one seems to be stating the obvious. Yet, like most clichés, there is a reason why we all take it for granted that this is what we humans do. As individuals, we value our ability to learn productively from such everyday experiences as going about our work, caring for our family, encountering friends and neighbours, experiencing illness, enjoying sports and hobbies, or sitting around relaxing. And this capacity matters. Later in this article, I suggest that our capacity for learning from our lives is also a major influence on who we are (our 'identity') and how we live with others. More immediately, it can help us earn a living, avoid injury, make and repair things, plan ahead and deal with life's crises. At a wider level, it helps to shape our social relationships and our economic position. There have been many attempts to grasp the nature of the ways in which we learn from life. Thischapter will focus on a selection of these ideas. It starts by considering the very notion of life as a permanent process of learning, which requires constant reflection on all the institutions and practices in which we engage. These ideas have helped to shape public policies on lifelong learning, and emerge from radically new conditions of everyday life. They are therefore important in establishing the context of our lives in the contemporary world, as well as underlining the importance that continuous learning has in late modern societies. I then go on to consider theories of narrative learning and of experiential and biographical learning, all of which seek to understand the relationship between learning and life. While these can be seen as educational responses to motivational psychology, I will argue here that our learning needs to be understood in socio-cultural terms, as an outcome of everyday life as it is lived in constant interaction with specific socio-economic conditions, and as experienced through each individual's interpretations of and actions on those conditions. The chapter frames these issues in terms and concepts drawn from the work of Pierre Bourdieu. It then concludes with suggestions for policy and practice based on the preceding analysis.",

      "title": "Low-Spoon Teaching: Labor, Gender, and Self-Accommodation in Academia",
      "abstract": "Low-Spoon Teaching:Labor, Gender, and Self-Accommodation in Academia Sara N. Beam (bio) and Holly Clay-Buck (bio) As professors, we too have disabilities. Our graduate degrees do not fix our dyslexia or cure our lupus or protect our loved ones from harm. Something happens, however, in the gap between our students and ourselves where understanding, empathy, and accommodation evaporate in the face of our own self-expectations. Self-accommodation is an intensely important and woefully overlooked academic practice, especially for women. Because educating is inherently replete with emotional labor, educators must self-accommodate for illness, disability, and fatigue in order to be maximally effective. When we are not taking care of ourselves, we are not presenting our best selves to our students. Self-accommodation is not a simple exercise, though, because it is directly at odds with America's culture of ruthless self-reliance and \"toughing it out,\" with women's perceptions of self-worth being tied to usefulness, with expectations of female availability, and with our own (often founded) fears of appearing \"weak\" or less capable than male colleagues. In this article, we begin with our personal stories and then provide concrete advice about how to seek and implement self-accommodation strategies and plan for what we call \"low-spoon teaching.\" Our concept of low-spoon teaching draws from Christine Miserandino's \"The Spoon Theory,\" in which she employs everyday objects—spoons—to metaphorically describe life with an invisible disability that causes varying levels of daily pain and energy; in her theory, each spoon represents a unit of energy.1 Low-spoon teaching, then, is teaching with few units of energy and planning ahead for low-energy days by building a classroom culture of collaboration, flexibility, and adaptation. We connect these strategies and the details of our stories to the larger contexts of gender, labor, dis/ability, and institutional expectations for women in academia. Though we acknowledge that we are both personally afforded many privileges, being cisgendered, white, employed full-time, and in committed partnerships, our hope is that these practices can be helpful even to those with less supportive institutions and communities. [End Page 173] On 5 May 2016, at the age of thirty-six, my spine stopped working. A birth defect combined with the repetitive stress of reading, grading, and typing for almost twenty years culminated in the too-narrow spaces within my C2-C4 vertebrae sliding shut. What followed were months of paralysis, helplessness, and the most excruciating pain of my life. It happened, fortunately, on the last day of the semester, so I spent the summer having surgery and starting the grueling process of recovery. As the summer came to an end, it was clear that I had to start making the kinds of accommodations for myself that I had been making for my students for years. Still in a hard neck brace and unable to drive, I worked with my department chair to switch out three of my five on-ground classes with online classes, limiting my painful forty-five minute commute from five times a week to two. Riding along with coworkers got me there when I could not safely drive. I also acquired a drafting table from the art department for my office, which made it possible to grade without hunching over and restarting the process that had shifted my bones in the first place. A higher desk for my computer and a more stable chair also helped. These perfectly reasonable accommodations were relatively easy to procure, but I had to be willing to ask. I had to overcome the fear of being viewed as a bother, difficult, or a whiner and advocate for myself the same way I would advocate for a student. As a result, I was able to keep working in a way that was effective and minimally disruptive. Once the brace came off, I found myself suddenly in the realm of those with invisible disabilities, whose varying pain and energy are difficult to track, much less explain. The spinal pain was still present, and I will have to be careful with my body for the rest of my life, but the visual cue of the brace...",

      "title": "When Parallel Lives Intersect: Experiencing Multiple Perspectives in Our Own Journeys",
      "abstract": "As we travel through life, our journeys offer myriad observations, relationships, and experiences. By chance and choice, our journeys align closely with and are guided by other people's journeys; from these associations we form a sense of our individual cultural characteristics and self-identities. Simultaneously, our journeys follow courses that remain distant and distinct from other people's paths; yet our observations and interpretations from afar also contribute strongly to the formulation of individual cultural characteristics and self-identities. Throughout life's dynamic encounters and events, each of us continues to formulate, reformulate, and negotiate our self-identities as we traverse what seems like parallel paths-journeys that appear distant and distinct from other journeys, yet encountering equally powerful influences shaping our thoughts, beliefs, and actions. Rarely are we afforded the opportunities to investigate these parallel paths and communicate honestly with individuals who seemed far away and foreign; seldom can we truly experience multiple perspectives and cross-cultural relationships in our own journeys. This article presents the unique intersection of two parallel lives and the authentic exchange of multiple perspectives reported through narrative or personal life histories. The authors serendipitously met at a National Association for Multicultural Education (NAME) conference and by chance shared their childhood stories. The authors were raised in similar environments but from opposite lifestyles -lifestyles that paralleled one another and contributed significantly to their individual understanding of cultural characteristics and self-identity. Here they share their histories spanning 50 years while providing insights and guidelines for teachers and teacher educators to learn from our pasts and reshape our futures.",

In addition, the labor market experiences of unemployed jobseekers lead to self-doubts about their value as professionals, and the growing financial crisis results in undermining of identities as parents and providers, and even as self-sufficient adults. Moreover, most jobseekers experience ever intensifying anxiety over the growing gap in their resumes. Feelings of shame, the undermining of key identities, and rising anxiety together mean that negative emotions are all but an inevitable consequence of long-term unemployment; yet, in this chapter we also hear recruiters explain that any hint of negative feelings from an applicant means they are excluded from consideration. In short, unemployed jobseekers are trapped by stigmas, and then further trapped by experiencing negative emotions in response to such stigmas.",

If education is supposed to prepare one for life, then Death Education is crucial in assisting individuals to cope with \"myriad loss issues.\" This paper will explore the implications of loss for health and well-being, and briefly review some of the research findings regarding the negative impact of grief and bereavement upon health. The stages of the grief process will be cited, mentioning some of the barriers to grief resolution. Most importantly, the positive aspects of loss upon life and health will be elaborated.",

When my own body requires me either to lie down in public places or absent myself from the social world, I face complicated questions about who I am and who I want to be in a world where I do not conform. Interweaving diaries and memory with conversation, observation, secondary research, and reflection, this autoethnographic text is a celebration of the rebel body and of a search for a more curious way of being. Unfolding a collective need for courage to break rules that cry out to be broken, Lying Down Anyhow begins with my body but is, more truthfully, a tale for every body.",

      "title": "\"Manumission and Marriage?\": Freedom, Family, and Identity in Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale",
      "abstract": "My knowledge, my clothes, my language, even, were second-hand, made by, and perhaps for, other men. I was living a lie, that was the heart of it. My argument was: whatever my origin, I would be wholly responsible for the shape I gave myself in the future, for shirting myself handsomely with a new life that called me like a siren to possibilities that were real but forever out of my reach. --Andrew Hawkins, in the process of requesting manumission from Jonathan Polkinghorne in Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale The pursuit of political freedom is necessarily ambivalent because it is at odds with security, stability, protection, and irresponsibility; because it requires that we surrender the conservative pleasures of familiarity, insularity, and routine for investment in a more open horizon of possibility and sustained willingness to risk identity, both collective and individual. Freedom thus conceived is precisely at odds with the adolescent pleasures held out by liberal formulations of liberty as license.... Freedom of the kind that seeks to set the terms of social existence requires inventive and careful use of power rather than rebellion against authority; it is sober, exhausting, and without parents. --Wendy Brown, States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity Alongside an excerpt from an inaugural moment in Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, I begin with an extended epigraph from political philosopher Wendy Brown, whose formulations of freedom echo Johnson's in a number of significant ways. Writing some thirteen years after the publication of Oxherding Tale, Brown similarly proposes an intervention in the prolonged interdisciplinary debates about identity, politics, and enfranchisement in late modern America. While readily conceding the import of politics to the evolution of progressive social and cultural engagement, both Johnson and Brown caution against overzealous investment in what Johnson terms codified and institutionalized formulations of (Philosophy 82). In their analyses, a politics that posits a historically fixed identity as the premise for social agency--that asserts as its core, for example, an authentic black or female Self inadequately considers a world of possibility beyond the constraints and confines of contemporary injustices. Indeed, for Andrew Hawkins, the protagonist of Johnson's neo-slave narrative, chattel status is fundamentally linked to the shamefully second-hand robes of prescriptive (17). Accordingly, it is in large part Andrew's philosophical dissatisfaction with the pre-designated parameters of his racially inherited that occasions his development of radical new thought (and action) about personal and political freedom, about physical and metaphysical manumission. In Oxherding Tale, the historical event of American slavery is revisited and revised as a synecdoche for a more broadly conceived notion of African American bondage, past and present, physical, philosophical and psychological. While the plot ostensibly unfolds along the genetic lines of the antebellum slave narrative, following its first-person narrator from birth in bondage to freedom that is confirmed through marital status and property ownership, Johnson's strategic re-appropriation of the form works to address both historical convention and modern readings of the past. (1) History, as revisited through Johnson's novel, is already and conspicuously infused with the prejudices and preoccupations of the modern eye/I. For example, the reader is encouraged--goaded, even--by the narrator who periodically slips into late twentieth-century vernacular, to read the historical plots of black cultural nationalism and second-wave feminism as pretexts to an allegory situated in the nineteenth century. Consider the proto-feminist Flo Hatfield, described as so liberated from convention that no one in Abbeville would touch her with a barge pole (44-45), or again, the proto-black nationalist George Hawkins, who protests against engaging in mundane chores, arguing that this was no work . …",

      "title": "¿Es hora de establecer propósitos de medio año?",
      "abstract": "Probablemente le resulte demasiado familiar. En contra de sus mejores intenciones, ha vuelto a ir en busca de tentempiés a altas horas de la noche. Le habla de forma cortante a un compañero que en realidad no ha dicho nada malo. Encuentra excusas para que la salida a correr diaria se convierta en una cada quince días. Está convencido de que no quiere volver a comportarse así, pero aquí está, haciéndolo de nuevo.El psicólogo Michael Inzlicht, de la Universidad de Toronto, lleva mucho tiempo fascinado por la forma en que cumplimos —o no— con nuestras metas, llámese esto fuerza de voluntad, autocontrol u otra cosa.CRÉDITO: JAMES PROVOST (CC BY-ND)El psicólogo Michael InzlichtUniversidad de TorontoTambién le intriga nuestra complicada relación con el esfuerzo. Por un lado, hay mucha evidencia de que intentamos evitar el esfuerzo a toda costa. Por otro, a menudo encontramos en el esfuerzo sentido y propósito.Utilizando diversos experimentos y enfoques, Inzlicht investiga cuándo las personas, en su laboratorio o fuera de él, evitan o invierten esfuerzo, consideran que las cosas son significativas o irrelevantes, controlan sus impulsos o se dejan llevar por ellos, empatizan o no —y qué ocurre cuando se aburren hasta perder la razón—.Un artículo de 2021 en el Annual Review of Psychology, del que Inzlicht es coautor, examina cómo diferentes enfoques de investigación —desde experimentos de laboratorio hasta aplicaciones telefónicas que interrogan periódicamente a las personas sobre su vida cotidiana— pueden encajar para explicar mejor cómo funciona la autorregulación.¿Podrían los nuevos conocimientos psicológicos revelar estrategias para conseguir que nos comportemos como decimos que queremos? ¿O simplemente tenemos que reconsiderar nuestras motivaciones básicas?Tuvimos que preguntar, e Inzlicht tuvo la amabilidad de complacernos.Esta entrevista ha sido editada para lograr más claridad.¿Cómo se estudia algo como el autocontrol en un laboratorio? Una prueba clásica es la de Stroop, en la que mostramos a las personas palabras que no solo se refieren a colores, sino que también se muestran en texto coloreado, y les pedimos que nombren el color en el que se muestra la palabra. Esto es muy fácil, por supuesto, cuando el color de la palabra coincide con el color al que se refiere, y mucho más difícil cuando no es así. Solíamos pensar que las personas que cometían pocos errores en este tipo de pruebas tenían un gran autocontrol.Pero, aunque este tipo de prueba es agradable porque es muy exacta y controlable, no da una imagen completa de cómo se comporta una persona en la vida diaria, por supuesto. Por suerte, otros investigadores están haciendo un trabajo complementario.Hay un estudio precioso que empezó a seguir a unos 1.000 bebés nacidos en un pueblo de Nueva Zelanda hace más de 50 años, y ha seguido a muchos de ellos desde entonces.Las personas de este estudio calificadas por sus padres, sus profesores y, finalmente, por ellos mismos como personas con un alto autocontrol, experimentaron todo tipo de beneficios. Tenían mejores ingresos, más dinero en el banco, mejor salud, menos probabilidades de sufrir enfermedades mentales y menos probabilidades de ser condenados por un delito. Por todo ello, se podría suponer que estas personas ejercían más autocontrol a diario.Pero cuando empezamos a buscar las asociaciones entre el rendimiento de las personas en tareas como la prueba de Stroop y el autocontrol reportado en los estudios a largo plazo que predecían todo lo bueno, no encontramos ninguna.Nuestra conclusión es que es muy importante distinguir entre lo que llamamos autocontrol \"de estado\" —cómo se comporta la persona en experimentos diseñados para comprobar su autocontrol en un entorno concreto— y el autocontrol \"de rasgo\" —cuánto autocontrol muestran en la vida diaria, según lo juzgan ellos mismos y los demás—. No son lo mismo.Las personas tienden a evitar el esfuerzo y, sin embargo, paradójicamente, también pueden sentirse atraídas por actividades como el alpinismo, donde el esfuerzo es un punto central.CRÉDITO: ISTOCK.COM / JAZZLOVESe trata de un hallazgo contraintuitivo. ¿Qué cree que podría explicarlo?Creo que un estudio realizado en Alemania, que yo y otros hemos reproducido, nos da una pista. Estos investigadores dieron a la gente unos beepers y les enviaron mensajes siete veces al día durante una semana para hacerles preguntas como: \"¿Tiene algún deseo ahora mismo?\". En algunos de los estudios que hicimos, añadimos algunas más: \"¿Esos deseos entran en conflicto con sus objetivos personales? Y si lo hacen, ¿intentó contenerse? ¿Y tuvo éxito?\"Lo que los investigadores alemanes descubrieron, y nosotros hemos confirmado, es que las personas que declaran tener más autocontrol en general afirman controlarse menos a menudo en la vida cotidiana.Estos hallazgos han convencido a muchos investigadores de que, para empezar, deberíamos preocuparnos menos por el autocontrol y más por los deseos de las personas. Y es que resulta que las personas que parecen tener un gran autocontrol en la vida diaria manifiestan menos deseos que entran en conflicto con sus objetivos. Simplemente, no les apetecen tanto los alimentos poco saludables cuando están a dieta y no se sienten tan tentados a comprar cosas cuando intentan ahorrar dinero. LEA MÁS La mente Lecciones de la investigación en la psicología del deporte La mente El camino psicopático hacia el éxito La mente La ciencia de los hábitos Pero, ¿cómo han llegado a ser así? ¿Por qué tienen menos deseos? ¿Cómo es que sus deseos son más virtuosos? Eso aún no lo sabemos. Algunas personas piensan que pueden adoptar otras formas de autocontrol, como gestionar su entorno de forma que les ayude a evitar la tentación. Por ejemplo, si está intentando evitar comer entre comidas, no compre cosas de picar o, si lo hace, guárdelas en la cocina o en el garaje, no junto al televisor.Pero la vida es impredecible, así que no creo que eso lo explique todo. Creo que también están conectados de forma diferente.¿Hasta qué punto estas diferencias en el cableado pueden tener su origen en el aprendizaje? ¿Podrían estar influidas por la medida en que se recompensó la moderación o la persistencia a medida que crecíamos?Absolutamente, creo que eso es cierto de múltiples maneras. En un estudio que hemos publicado recientemente, nuestros datos sugieren que recompensar sistemáticamente a las personas por sus esfuerzos, en lugar de por el resultado de los mismos, hace que estén más dispuestas a esforzarse, incluso en tareas totalmente distintas.Si naces en un entorno desfavorecido, no necesariamente cuanto más te esfuerces, más cosas buenas obtendrás. Los esfuerzos que hagas en casa no necesariamente te reportarán una recompensa. Crear lugares donde se recompensen los esfuerzos y no los resultados, por ejemplo, en la escuela, podría ser una forma de avanzar en estas situaciones.Esto es importante, porque las probabilidades de éxito suelen ser mayores si te esfuerzas. Las oportunidades no están repartidas equitativamente, pero es bueno intentar aprovechar al máximo las que se tienen, si se puede.Debo añadir, sin embargo, que creo que en nuestra sociedad se exagera a menudo la relación entre esfuerzo y recompensa. Las personas nacidas en un entorno de privilegio suelen decir que se han \"hecho a sí mismas\", porque han trabajado duro y, por tanto, creen que merecen todo lo que han ganado, y que los demás solo deberían haberse esforzado un poco más. Sin embargo, ignoran las manos invisibles que les han ayudado.Pero si el éxito depende en gran medida de la inclinación de las personas a resistirse a la tentación, ya sea que han nacido con ella o que la han aprendido a temprana edad, ¿qué podemos hacer los demás?\"Una buena planificación puede ayudar a las personas a necesitar menos autocontrol en el momento y aun así ser mejores a la hora de alcanzar sus objetivos\".Basándonos en las investigaciones que demuestran que las personas que parecen tener un alto autocontrol en la vida diaria declaran tener menos ocasiones de caer en la tentación, creo que es importante que la gente trabaje realmente en su motivación interna para alcanzar un objetivo, de modo que se convierta en algo que realmente desean. Convencerse de que quieren comer más sano porque les hace sentir mejor, hasta el punto de que ya no les gusta la comida poco sana. Sin embargo, es un problema difícil. ¿Cómo te convences a ti mismo para que te guste el brócoli? Aparte del condicionamiento pavloviano, en el que se combina constantemente algo que es neutro o desagradable con algo gratificante hasta que lo primero se vuelve atractivo por sí solo, no tengo una gran respuesta. Pero creo que se puede hacer.Ahora bien, se pueden tener múltiples objetivos contradictorios que pueden ser todos igual de valiosos, algo con lo que yo lucho personalmente. Me considero una persona bastante concienzuda, pero a veces me centro demasiado en los objetivos, y eso puede provocar conflictos con mi familia. Cuando mis hijos eran pequeños, el objetivo de dedicarles tiempo y las exigencias de mi trabajo entraban a menudo en conflicto.En estos casos, puede ser útil planificar cuándo se va a hacer qué, para no tener que negociar constantemente ese conflicto día tras día. Este es un ejemplo de cómo una buena planificación puede ayudar a las personas a necesitar menos autocontrol en el momento y, aun así, alcanzar mejor sus objetivos.Creo que las personas con un alto nivel de autocontrol planifican más y mejor. Aún no lo hemos comprobado, pero estoy convencido de que ayuda fijarse un objetivo y evaluar periódicamente los progresos.Por supuesto, es posible que no siempre puedas seguir el plan, y eso también tienes que aceptarlo. Algunos estudios sugieren que las personas con un alto nivel de agallas pueden perder oportunidades. Las anteojeras que nos mantienen en la tarea pueden impedirnos ver el horizonte o mirar a la periferia para descubrir otras opciones.Las investigaciones revelan que la gente está más dispuesta a apoyar obras benéficas si hacerlo requiere un esfuerzo físico. Este hombre debe de estar muy motivado ante la idea de salvar a los rinocerontes.CRÉDITO: CRAZYCHRIS84 / SHUTTERSTOCKUno de los argumentos en contra de hacer planes o fijarse objetivos puede ser que puede resultar muy decepcionante si no se logra alcanzarlos a tiempo. Algunas personas pueden desanimarse y abandonar por completo su objetivo.En primer lugar, sabemos que los sentimientos negativos pueden ser decisivos para ayudarte a cumplir tus objetivos. Si solo son temporales, pueden ser muy motivadores. No nos gustan los sentimientos negativos, pero pueden indicarnos algo: \"Eh, presta atención. Detente. Mira\". La cuestión importante es qué haces con esas emociones. La gente puede experimentar emociones negativas y empezar a machacarse y distraerse de la tarea. Es entonces cuando dejan de ser propicias para alcanzar los objetivos.Pero también hay personas que son muy conscientes de cómo se sienten. Cuando hacen lo que no quieren hacer, o se sienten tentados a hacerlo, toman conciencia de ello. Entonces, críticamente, no se castigan, sino que dicen: \"Interesante, esto ha pasado —no lo vuelvas a hacer—\". Eso puede ser muy útil. Los estudios han demostrado que las personas con un alto autocontrol tienden a sentirse más culpables por las transgresiones. Pero experimentan la culpa con menos frecuencia, porque anticipan lo que les hará sentirse mal y lo evitan.Hay mucho revuelo en las redes sociales en torno a la idea de \"manifestar\". La gente se concentra en un objetivo hasta que lo consigue y pide a los demás que se concentren en conseguirlo. En algunos casos se trata de pensamiento mágico o estafa financiera, y es comprensible que se ridiculice. Pero, ¿podría la actividad, como tal, tener beneficios a nivel psicológico?En primer lugar, comparto lo de reírse de ello, pero estoy de acuerdo en que podría ser eficaz. El efecto placebo es real. Nuestras expectativas guían cómo percibimos las cosas, lo que a su vez guía las acciones que emprendemos. Por ejemplo, muchos atletas visualizan cuidadosamente los distintos pasos de su actuación antes de empezar.Involucrar a otras personas es una forma de lo que los economistas del comportamiento llaman precompromiso. Es como un compromiso: si tus amigos saben que quieres hacer algo, no querrás decepcionarlos. Así que quizá te esfuerces más por conseguirlo. Puede ser motivador y potencialmente fortalecedor. No va a funcionar si lo único que haces es pensar en ello, pero puede funcionar si te ayuda a pasar a la acción y mantener el rumbo.Incluso cuando persiguen lo que se dicen a sí mismos que realmente quieren, a muchas personas les cuesta mantener el rumbo y sienten que requiere mucho esfuerzo. ¿Podría haber una forma de cambiar esto?Sería maravilloso poder embotellarlo. Aún no lo hemos conseguido, pero nos hemos esforzado por comprender mejor la peculiar relación de las personas con el esfuerzo, que es realmente intrigante. Hace unos años, mis colegas y yo propusimos algo que llamamos la paradoja del esfuerzo. La idea es que parece que el esfuerzo se evita y se afronta, según cómo se mire.En tres experimentos hemos dado a la gente listas de tareas cotidianas y les hemos preguntado por el esfuerzo que les supone cada una de ellas y el significado que les atribuyen. Y hemos encontrado una asociación, aunque no muy fuerte, para cosas como asistir a clase, trabajar y hacer ejercicio: las tareas que requieren más esfuerzo se consideran más significativas.También hemos preguntado a los encuestados cuánto disfrutan realizar estas tareas, y los resultados persisten si controlamos este aspecto: las personas experimentan las tareas que requieren esfuerzo como más significativas, independientemente de si las disfrutan más o menos. Este vínculo entre significado y esfuerzo podría explicar por qué seguimos realizando estas tareas.Una de nuestras tareas experimentales favoritas en este momento es la tarea de selección de demanda. Básicamente, se da a elegir entre dos barajas de cartas. Cada baraja consta de cartas en las que se pide a los participantes que realicen cuatro cálculos muy sencillos. Ambas son muy sencillas, pero la tarea de una baraja es más fácil que la de la otra. Cuando damos a la gente una serie de opciones, lo que descubrimos es que eligen abrumadoramente la más fácil.Pero, curiosamente, cuando les preguntamos, las personas también atribuyen más significado a la opción más difícil en la tarea de selección de la demanda, lo que, en mi opinión, vuelve a demostrar que existe una conexión, quizá incluso causal. Las personas también atribuyen más valor a las cosas en las que han invertido esfuerzo, como un mueble que han armado por sí mismas o algo que han escrito.Esto es algo muy profundo: incluso roedores, pájaros y saltamontes prefieren cosas difíciles de conseguir.Muchos propósitos de Año Nuevo se refieren a cosas que hacemos en beneficio propio, pero algunos de nosotros intentamos hacer más por los demás. ¿Implica esto las mismas dificultades, o no del todo?\"Si tus amigos saben que estás intentando hacer esta cosa, no querrás decepcionarlos. Así que quizá te esfuerces más por conseguirlo\".También hemos adaptado la tarea de selección de demanda para averiguar hasta qué punto puede suponer un esfuerzo la empatía. Una vez más, les damos a los participantes dos barajas de cartas: en una les pedimos que \"describan\" y en la otra que \"sientan\" las emociones de las personas que aparecen en las imágenes. Ten en cuenta que en este caso ni siquiera hay una respuesta correcta o incorrecta, no estamos evaluando la respuesta de la gente, solo les pedimos que lo hagan.Lo hemos hecho varias veces, de formas ligeramente distintas. Los patrones no siempre son significativos, pero en general sugieren que la gente suele preferir \"describir\" a \"sentir\"; la gente tiende a evitar la empatía.Y lo que es más importante, esto ocurre incluso cuando utilizamos imágenes positivas, lo que requeriría que los participantes sintieran la alegría de la otra persona. Así que la empatía también se evita en el caso de la empatía positiva, no se trata simplemente de que la gente evite sentirse mal. En la inmensa mayoría de los estudios que hemos realizado sobre este tema, las personas describen la baraja de \"sentir\" como más exigente mentalmente, desalentadora, irritante, estresante, lo que podría explicar por qué la evitan.En este sentido, las personas parecen evitar la empatía del mismo modo que evitan el esfuerzo. Sin embargo, del mismo modo que cultivar la motivación interna ayuda a las personas a perseguir sus propósitos, descubrimos que es más probable que apoyen una obra benéfica si sienten que está más alineada con su propia identidad. Además, curiosamente, también hay estudios que demuestran que las personas están más dispuestas a donar dinero a una buena causa si esta les exige realizar un esfuerzo físico, como una carrera benéfica.De un modo curioso, estas tareas que usted pide que realicen los participantes en el estudio se interponen entre ellos y las demás obligaciones de su lista de tareas pendientes, por supuesto. ¿Cómo puede afectar eso al resultado de estos estudios?Por supuesto, ninguna de estas tareas que pedimos a la gente que realice es intrínsecamente significativa o importante para ellos. Así que creo que, como psicólogos, deberíamos preguntarnos hasta qué punto la evitación del esfuerzo que vemos en nuestro laboratorio es producto de la forma en que hemos diseñado nuestras tareas. Yo siempre parto de la base de que la principal motivación de mis participantes es salir del laboratorio y hacer otra cosa. Así que, a menos que nuestra intención sea estudiar el aburrimiento o la fatiga, creo que no deberíamos dar a la gente tareas muy largas.Sin embargo, el aburrimiento es un elemento muy interesante en nuestros estudios. Por mucho que a la gente le disguste el esfuerzo, también le desagrada mucho no hacer nada. En nuestra tarea de selección de demanda, la gente puede preferir una tarjeta que le suponga un esfuerzo a otra que le pida no hacer nada. De hecho, algunos estudios demuestran que, si se les da a elegir, las personas prefieren administrarse una descarga eléctrica antes que no hacer nada. La gente sabía lo que haría el botón, pero casi la mitad lo pulsó al menos una vez, y un hombre lo pulsó sin parar. En otro estudio, muchos participantes eligieron matar gusanos en lugar de no hacer nada: no se dañó a ningún insecto, pero la gente creyó que sí.Creo que el aburrimiento, una emoción que indica que ya no estamos comprometidos con lo que ocurre, puede impulsarnos a explorar, lo cual puede ser muy positivo. Y aunque hace más difícil seguir haciendo un trabajo aburrido, si no tenemos nada más que hacer, o necesitamos un descanso de una tarea más desafiante, también puede hacer que ciertas tareas sean más tentadoras.Puede ser útil incorporar esa percepción a la hora de intentar alcanzar tus objetivos. Si te sientes incapaz de seguir haciendo lo que habías planeado hacer, piensa si te sientes capaz de hacer otra cosa de tu lista.Artículo traducido por Debbie Ponchner",

      "title": "Encountering and Understanding Suffering",
      "abstract": "In this article I claim that service-learning experiences, wherein students work directly with individuals in need—individuals from whom stu- dents can learn what they cannot learn elsewhere—are invaluable, and perhaps necessary, for any curriculum with an aim toward the development of ethical understanding, personal moral character and commitment, and/or conscien- tious citizenship, both local and global. My argument rests on Emmanuel Levinas's philosophical ethical theory that re-envisions the ethical relation as arising out of revelation from the unique and precious Other, rather than reason and the rational determinations and conceptions of the ethical agent. How can I make sense of the suffering of another person, if I have never experienced such suffering myself? How can we learn about the needs of those who suffer from people who have never experienced such suffering? For Emmanuel Levinas, French postmodern ethicist, the authority on whom I necessarily depend for any instruction about suffering can only be the person who suffers herself. In seeking to un- derstand the suffering or need of another person, I seek to understand something about the world that is essentially off-limits to me. It is something that only she can possibly truly know. She is the expert on her suffering. I can try to imagine how I would feel in her situation. But I am not her. I can ask third parties if they can shed light on her experience, but they, too, are not privy to real understanding of her experience. The only access I have to her pain and need is granted to me through her willingness to reveal her suffering to me. Any understand- ing I might come to have is grounded in this revelation. She—the one who suffers—is the only truly reliable source of that information. 1 My claim in this article is that service-learning experiences in col- leges and universities, wherein students work directly with individuals in need—individuals from whom students can learn what they cannot learn elsewhere—are invaluable, and perhaps necessary, for any cur-",

      "title": "Invisible Young Men: African American Males, Academics, and Athletics",
      "abstract": "As a pre-Civil Rights era novel dramatizing Ralph Ellison's perspective on being African American in the United States at mid-20th century, Invisible Man opens with the unnamed narrator explaining:I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. . . . When they approach me they see only my surroundings, them- selves, or figments of their imaginations-indeed, everything and anything except me. . . . That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact . . . [Y]ou often doubt if you really exist. . . . It's when you feel like this that, out of resentment, you begin to bump back. And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time. You ache with the need to convince yourself that you exist in the real world, that you're a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out with your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognize you. And, alas, it's seldom success- ful. (3-4)Readers learn that the narra- tor's response to his invisibility, ultimately, is hibernation, a with- drawal from a society, a world that refuses to see him.A 2012 report from the Office of Civil Rights offers a disturbing picture of how US public schools see African American (AA) males in the first decade of the 21st century: AA males are dispropor- tionately targeted in disciplinary actions in schools, referred to law enforcement, and suspended from schools. The academic picture for AA males is just as disturb- ing since they have less access to advanced courses but are over- represented in retention data. AA males also tend to sit in class- rooms taught by inexperienced and under-/un-certified teach- ers who are under-compensated (Revealing New Truths).When AA males are seen in school, then, many must recog- nize that they are mostly viewed as misbehaving, as potential, if not already, criminals. AA males have become both the embodi- ment and stereotype of the school- to-prison pipeline as well as the school-as-prison phenomenon associated with urban schools across the United States (Nolan). Like Ellison's invisible narrator, then, AA males often make deci- sions paralleling the narrator's hibernation-one of which is seeking the support and potential achievement found in athletics, both as an oasis of possibility and as a ticket to college or a profes- sion (despite that ticket often being an illusion).Results from a new study [see Harper, Williams, and Black- man] on graduation rates of black male athletes, explains Andre Perry, illustrate our sacrosanct commitment to developing black football players in colleges and universities, adding: men among the top 25 BCS schools represent 3 percent of their stu- dent bodies but 60 percent of the football players. Simultaneously, the data make plain the limita- tions colleges place on black male academic achievement. Black stu- dents are apparently good enough for the playing fields but not the laboratories. Shaun R. Harper, Collin D. Williams, and Horatio W. Blackman detail that AA male athletes experience comparatively low college graduation rates, prompting Perry to argue:If colleges can build up black foot- ball players, they can develop black scientists, historians and teachers. If colleges recruited, trained and competed black and Latino students in chemistry like they do in football, institutions could place more Nobel Prizes above their Bowl Championship Series trophies. But let's not wait for academics or a concussed fan base to incite much needed improvements in retention and graduation. Black football players must their political to move university leaders who ostensibly aren't compelled by data.Perry's call for AA males to push their political weight once they become college athletes is a powerful and daunting message, one that should inform current commitments to education reform in K-12 settings serving young AA males. At the intersection of class, race, gender, academics, and athletics, then, how will the rush to implement Common Core (and related arguments for more non- fiction and greater close reading in ELA) and next-generation high- stakes tests affect the discipline and academic inequities identified above as they affect AA males? …",

      "title": "Playing Symbolically with Death in Extreme Sports",
      "abstract": "Many amateur sportsmen in the West, have today started undertaking long and intensive ordeals where their personal capacity to withstand increasing suffering is the prime objective. Running, jogging, the triathlon and trekking are the sorts of ordeal where people without any particular ability are not pitting themselves against others but are committed to testing their own capacity to withstand increasing pain. Constantly called upon to prove themselves in a society where reference points are both countless and contradictory and where values are in crisis, people are now seeking a one-to-one relationship by redical means, testing their strength of character, their courage and their personal resources. Going right on to the end of a self-imposed ordeal gives a legitimacy to life and provides a symbolic plank that supports them. Performance itself is of secondary significance; it has a value only to the individual. There is no struggle against a third party, only a method for reinforcing personal will-power and over-coming suffering by going right to the limit of a personally imposed demand. The physical limit has come to replace the moral limit that present-day society is failing to provide. Overcoming suffering tempers the individual, providing a renewed significance and value to his life.",

      "title": "CHAPTER 5: Don't Just Stand There, Do Something",
      "abstract": "Called for Life reflects on our calling to serve God and neighbor in the context of retirement. People facing retirement ask a variety of questions, each framed by a different perspective. \"Will I ever be interested in retiring?\" some baby boomers ask. \"Who am I now?\" newly retired clergy ask. \"What, if anything, is God calling me to do and be after retirement?\" all inquire. This book is built on the assumption that most people don't want to spend the last third of their lives doing nothing. What they want is a life that is worth living, an occupation that will help others, and a retirement in which they can continue to exercise their calling. Clayton uses examples from his own experience and from others, laity and clergy, to explore retirement and the three components of our calling: our identity, our gifts, and our occupation. He also examines the role of community in our calling and retirement, the challenges of the transition into retirement, options for meaningful activity, the importance of identifying our purpose, doing and being in retirement, and the final call to death. Readers will be encouraged to see retirement as an opportunity to do what they have always wanted to do and to become the kind of person they have wanted to be.",

Perhaps an irrational paranoia summoned by eeting thoughts of human monsters: serial murderers, spree killers, ideological terrorists; all anxieties born of the feeling that one day we might simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or maybe more abstract concepts: failure, loneliness, disease, irrelevance, death. But how often do such thoughts cause us to lose sleep in comparison to the creeping dread that accompanies anxiety brought on by the economic terrors of everyday life: those unwanted reminders of household bills, loan repayments, looming expenses, dwindling bank balances, distant pay cheques and the petrifying prospects of debt, unemployment, homelessness and starvation?",

Probably the most effective way to construct the work and make sure the reader doesn't get bored is to tell a good story. This may seem terribly obvious. Yet not all novelists set out to hold our interest by an energetic storyline: they may be more concerned just with people and their relationships; or they may be primarily interested in ideas, in philosophical or religious notions and using the novel as a vehicle for these. They may even despise the story as being something rather crude and limited, all right for a thriller or detective novel but not worth serious attention in its own right.",

The focus is on the impulse to identify optimum moments in sunsets, fall foliage, etc., and possible explanations for this urge to identify the optimum. Then follow, by various associations of ideas, discussions of the anxieties of the expert who fears he is no longer moved by great works, to the general anxieties of properly attending to great art in museums, primarily the anxiety of when you can declare yourself ‘released’ from further homage. The large theme is how full immersion into the aesthetic experience is threatened to be undone by some aspects of the aesthetic experience itself, and then if not by that, by other anxieties about playing our roles of appreciators of beauty properly.",

Confrontation must be personal. Adults are needed if adolescents are to have life and liveliness. Confrontation belongs to containment that is non-retaliatory, without vindictiveness, but having its own strength. It is salutary to remember that the present student unrest and its manifest expression may be in part a product of the attitude that we are proud to have attained toward baby care, and child care, Let the young alter society and teach grownups how to see the world afresh; but, where there is the challenge of the growing boy or girl, there let an adult meet the challenge. And, it will not necessarily be nice. In the unconscious fantasy these are matters of life and death.",

      "abstract": "As late as day before having to write this paper, an analysand had a wonderful Lacanian dream. For moment I have a difficulty about recounting this dream and so I want to spend a little time examining that difficulty. I have a reluctance to tell anyone else anything at all of personal detail of most precious and intimate emergences of subjectivity that analysis involves. It is a reluctance born of wish to safeguard trust that patient has placed in what he is doing. And yet, I don't believe that it breaks trust to talk about aspects of a case which is disguised. There is, of course, a wish to share something of actuality of clinic which is an impossibility. The transmission of actuality of clinic is doomed to fail. The session is over. Its immediacy, surprise, intentness, richness, suspense, its hesitations are irretrievable. I cannot reproduce of all that has been represented in a brief session. I have to live with something at a remove from its non-sense or pas-de-sens. Given richness of French language, this pas-de-sens, as signifier of pure presence of subject, is, as we know, a step towards sense. However, my clinical account is the produced. This sense produced, in consequence, effaces subject-effect of clinic itself. Lacan often likens this subject-effect to tourist spot that is always closing just as you arrive! The subject-effect of clinic can be witnessed only when you are in situ , when you are there, present in session. Expanding on tourist analogy, we all know dissatisfaction of never being able to convey to a fellow traveller something of beauty of a sunset witnessed alone or of chance encounter of a deer that unsuspectingly steps out of forest into your path. We are left with a transient thing of beauty that cannot be shared and we live with that",

      "title": "O.T. Wells",
      "abstract": "0. T. WELLS By MARILYN V. AINSWORTH OZRO THADDEUS WELLS, JR. - not exactly a commonplace name, not exactly a commonplace personality. From a distance, 0. T. Wells appears a fun-loving, witty, cocky, often flam- boyant man - an energetic attorney, constantly surrounded - seemingly guarded - by close friends. This public impression is complicated when one hears him speak, often quoting Bible passages in a manner characteristic of the Southern Black minister, or unabashedly acknowledging his deep devotion for his family. Any seeming contradiction is further highlighted when one engages him in serious private conversation where only occasional flashes of wit break through; the playfulness over- comes his concentration for an instant, then quickly retreats in favor of sobriety. The contrasting moods shift without in- congruity. O.T. is an open man, sincere in his desire to expend the maximum amount of effort necessary to accomplish whatever tasks he faces, frank in his appraisal of any situation which arises. He readily voices well-formed attitudes and opinions on any subject that is broached, and displays a deep concern for issues that affect Black people in or out of the American legal system. Com- passion for people is a recurring theme in any conversation with him. His devotion to his friends is legendary; to a person they proclaim him one in a million, he's always there when you need him. When in New York, he's easily acces- sible to his clients as well as to his friends and fellow attorneys. Late callers to his office find him answering the telephone after everyone else has left for the day. Clients can readily identify the only Wells, Ozro T. in the Manhattan direc- tory as the one they've been told they can reach whether the office is open or not. One such potential client called him away from Christmas dinner for an arraignment, and true to form, O.T. postponed his celebration until he had taken care of business. O.T. WAS BORN in Pennsylvania into what is probably one of the few Black families moving from North to South during the forties. They moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1941 where his father, a minister of the Church of God in Christ, was given the Bishopric of North Carolina. He received his elementary and high school education in the public schools in Greensboro and his strong religious training at home from his parents. Evidence of the influence of his parents and of the church in his life sur- faces frequently in his conversation. At one time he considered going into the ministry, but abandoned that idea in favor of a desire to do something different. When asked why he chose the law he'll quickly tell you that his mother wanted him to become a mortician, but when asked for an occupational pre- ference in the seventh grade, he found he couldn't spell it and scratched it out and wrote lawyer instead. Just as quickly shifting from the jest to the sober, he will very seriously reveal his true motives for choosing a legal career, revealing at the same time an awareness of himself that is somewhat unexpected. He admits to a fascination for people in the vocal professions. Analogies between the law and the ministry (probably the two most vocal professions) arise con- stantly; a desire to help people, a",

      "abstract": "language at large. In our early linguistic experience (God knows when), we learn word or phrase, say, of view. As students we read Henry James or some other narratologist who uses the term to refer to concept, or more likely, tangle of concepts that we have intuitively felt demands study. As established scholars we look long and hard for more appropriate term angle of vision, post of observation, focalization. At last we find one that seems just right, and we introduce it in the fond belief that it is definitive and transparent, only to discover that our readers start using our term in sense that seems strange, even perverse. Then we either defend the term, try to insist on its real or pure (because intended) sense, or, in frustration, abandon it and float another one. What is there about the ordinary usage of of that makes its projection into narratology so problematic? My desk dictionary lists two senses: a point from which things are viewed, and a mental position or viewpoint. (In the manner typical of small dictionaries, it in turn defines as 1. place affording view of and 2. point of view; an attitude of mind: the viewpoint of an artist. The OED and Webster's Third list other senses, including the narratological one, but I'm more concerned with the phrase in its basic popular usage.) The distinction seems to be between place from which something is seen (what we might more precisely call vista), and the mental attitude of the viewer. The second sense is clearly consequence of metaphoric and metonymic transfers. We literally stand in place, say the top of skyscraper, to see something, say the rest of the city. All three components of the situation the thing seen, the place from which it is seen, and the act of seeing are literal. But each of these, alone or together, can also be meant figuratively.

      "title": "Brlitish Secret Missions in Turkestan",
      "abstract": "The glamour and mystery attached to the role of the special agent, and especially to the agent on secret mission, have a perpetual allure. Many years after their work has ended agents are still the object of popular curiosity. This can, however, obscure some fundamental problems, which, if less exciting or more mundane, are of greater importance. Governments that dispatch special missions run the risk that the pressure of events on men in whom discretion is necessarily vested may drive them to overstep the bounds originally set for them. Such developments may also result from the characters and attitudes of the agents themselves. There can be no guarantee that a government's intentions are those of its representatives, especially as they are differently situated from those in more regularly constituted branches of state service. Further strains may arise from the personalities of those recruited. It is scarcely surprising that special service should appeal to eccentrics, social misfits or, more commonly, restless individualists. In personal relations such men can be most appealing, but for the official world they frequently bring difficulties of potentially serious dimensions. In the last resort the agent on special mission can be as great a terror to his friends as to his enemies. Such problems were clearly posed in the years between 1918 and 1920. Traditional British anxieties over the safety of India had been greatly accentuated during the first world war. The danger of German and Turkish intrigues in Afghanistan and Persia and with disaffected native Indian opinion, led to British and Russian military intervention in Persia in an attempt to screen Central Asia and India from the Central Powers. Emissaries of Gemany and Turkey were hunted down and detained, the Cossack Brigade of the Persian army expanded and,",

Yes, people are different and there is an underlying reason for it: the things that keep us apart are also the ones that complete us and make us whole as societies. As long as our disparities do not attack the other and as long as disagreements have place at the same table and can be addresses in a peaceful way, we are safe to move forward and create, behave, hope, understand the world and ourselves and most of all, live our lives as supposed to. We should all be allowed to act, behave and live in line with our innate abilities, desires, thinking models, psychological patterns and skills. Due to latest technology and social shifts underneath, today’s life has a clear predisposition to overexposure. As much as this is a pattern which some of the people can and are willing to embrace, for others it can be burden and more than that, an inhibitor of being who they actually are. They are preconditions for a misfit-type-of-attitude which can lead to major ruptures in behaviors and mental patterns for the individuals unequipped for this environment. A typical example is related to the introverts-extraverts binom and it should be explained in full and open recognition of all truths that needs to be said.

      "abstract": "From Ignorant Consumer to Informed Advocate: Lifting the Curtain and Confronting Oz Liz Parker The beginning: We entered the realm of parenthood late, as adoptive, rather than biological parents. When adopting, you walk a knife–edge, never knowing if the birth parents change their mind, or if the State might prohibit the adoption—you spend the months of the pregnancy, ultimately terrified, and work hard to distract yourself from any thought or plan beyond the day of birth. You have baby books on a shelf, but avoid the shelf, you borrow a crib, and procure only absolute essentials for baby; the idea of not coming home with baby, or worse, having to return baby to a birth parent who changes their mind during the foster period haunts your psyche. This is, undoubtedly the worst situation possible for informed decision–making when parenthood arrives and becomes a permanent reality. Our children: Our eldest arrived in late 1999, two weeks overdue, and healthy. Her birth mother stuck to the plan, and our daughter came home with us as our foster [End Page 176] child. As foster parents, we did exactly as we were told—“well baby” visits on the recommended pediatric schedule, vaccines on and even before the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended schedule, induced lactation (birth mom did not want to provide milk), the best formula supplement, and lots of love. She got three shots at two months; her appetite declined, her nose began to run. She got four shots at three and a half months and immediately disintegrated, health–wise and behaviorally, experiencing nearly all listed “adverse events,” and ending–up at the Emergency Room. By the time the adoption was official, she was permanently brain–injured and on her way to lifelong disability. Her care, to–date tallies in the millions of dollars, she lost her childhood to therapies, and will never gain an independent adulthood. We continued to vaccinate her because we were told, with each round and associated decline, “it’s not the vaccines.” I gave birth to our second child in 2001. She was perfect—until her shots at six months; she stopped breathing and turned blue while still at the pediatrician’s office—he resuscitated her; but she ended up at the hospital a short time later, unable to breathe; five hours of breathing treatments, steroids, allergy medicines, and more finally succeeded in restoring enough air flow. She was required to continue to take steroids, allergy medicine, and hourly breathing treatments (around the clock), for years. While at the hospital, I commented she had just gotten vaccinated—they told me, “vaccines can’t cause this—it was going to happen anyway.” There is no asthma in either family tree; I finally did my research. I was horrified at what I learned. At this point, we stopped vaccinating. Our third child was a lovely surprise—he arrived in 2005. He was breach, sunny–side–up, and footling; we tried for a home birth, but finally conceded defeat after 40 hours of labor. He arrived via C–Section; he did not get the birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine. Our vaccination decisions: To summarize, the eldest got shots through the second year, the middle child got shots through six months, and the youngest has never received a single shot. To achieve this, our family was dismissed from two pediatrics practices—we finally found a thinking practitioner, and have been with her practice ever since. The first real decision we made about vaccinating our children was not to vaccinate. Prior to this decision, we simply did what we were told by the doctor, whom we assumed had done extensive research and whom we assumed knew how vaccines were manufactured and tested, and that the vaccines were real–world efficacious (we were tragically mistaken). Having now read the prescribing information for each vaccine, the FDA licensure applications, having performed in–depth analysis of the research purporting to prove the vaccines are safe and effective, having read textbooks regarding immunity, biochemistry, immunohematology, having researched the historic morbidity and mortality associated with the “Vaccine Preventable Diseases” (VPD’s), and understanding how little Science knows about the function of these...",

      "abstract": "Educating the public about hazards such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, and floods, among other natural and technological events, not to mention a deliberate attack on human life such as a bombing or intentional release of a biological agent, is always a challenge. People generally do not want to believe that anything bad can happen to them. They are usually in a state of what risk communicators call denial. They want to decline acknowledgment of negative consequences that may result from impact of natural hazards because they either believe firmly that the hazard can not happen to them, where they live, or they rationalize about the impacts of the hazard to believe (or want to believe) that such events can only happen elsewhere, will not be “that bad,” or attribute to the fates and say to themselves, “If it is that bad, there’s nothing I can do about it anyway.” Worse, some are under the misconception that the Government, the Red Cross, or insurance will provide funds to restore their household to its pre-disaster state. In order to be more successful in engaging the public in meaningful activities toward being prepared for disasters and disruptive events, those who desire to do this work should keep twelve points in mind which research has shown to improve the effectiveness of disaster preparedness education. These “twelve Cs” are: Community Focus Consistent Messages Cost-effectiveness Coalitions Conciseness Compel Action Clear Messages Constant Repetition and Reinforcement Common Language Children Citizens Conversation",

      "title": "Absent Mother/Present Mothe: Wertenbaker’s Credible Witness and Kushner’s Homebody/Kabul",
      "abstract": "Absent Mother/Present Mothe:Wertenbaker’s Credible Witness and Kushner’s Homebody/Kabul Sara Freeman (bio) Mourning has to do with agreeing to undergo a transformation (perhaps one should say submitting to a transformation) the full result of which one cannot know in advance. —Judith Butler, Precarious Life Paradoxically, on stage a mother’s absence can turn into a type of presence and vice versa. Maternal absence signifies powerfully as part of performance, in part because it allows for a surrogacy and a transferal.1 Moreover, as Elaine Aston shows in her discussion of performance about the loss of mothers, absence opens a space for memory and representation.2 This may be the reason that it is difficult to stage maternal presence and that, on stage, present mother figures often border on being complex monsters. There is already too much “there” to welcome the overdetermined nature of a mother-as-presence instead of absence. Think of Clytemnestra, Hecuba, Medea, Volumnia, Queen Margaret, even Lady Macbeth or Mother Courage. This article considers how the figure of the mother is present even when she has been absented from the play, as in Tony Kushner’s Homebody/Kabul (1999), and pairs that concept with the troubling absent space around a mother figure when she is present on stage, as in Timberlake Wertenbaker’s Credible Witness (2001). Central to the insight that emerges from my chosen pairing is how the absence and presence of mother figures in these plays interact with notions of emplacement or displacement, home or exile. As politically minded authors, Kushner and Wertenbaker regularly employ epic dramatic structures that link family stories to the large forces of intellectual debate around social movements and international relations, including the heritage of colonialism. Written close in time to each other, the two plays capture the shifting Anglo-American interaction with the wider world in a way that speaks to the revivified sense of dislocation produced by an increased awareness of global terrorism in the twenty-first century and the ever more pressing [End Page 61] need to reconfigure international relations. With their highly theatrical uses of absence and presence, Homebody/Kabul and Credible Witness link the geopolitical and the maternal in ways that mobilize notions of otherness developed in contemporary cultural theory and envision how connection and autonomy can coexist in personal and national identity. Homebody/Kabul concerns a British family who travels through Afghanistan trying to find their disappeared mother and instead return to England bringing an educated Afghani woman with them, saving her from the suffering imposed by living under the Taliban. Credible Witness depicts the crisis over a surge of refugees seeking asylum in Britain at the start of the twenty-first century, when events related to immigrant detention centers were in the news (as they are again now). The play centers on a mother and son escaping political persecution in Macedonia and struggling in exile. Both plays premiered just prior to September 11, 2001, though both take on dimensional readings in light of the traumas of that day, because of how Kushner represents the politics of Afghanistan and how Wertenbaker depicts a Western indifference to the histories of political conflict in the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Because in these plays the geopolitical and the maternal intersect in the wake of personal and global loss, this article provides a theoretical foundation for reading them through theories about motherhood and theories about historical understandings of the self, society, violence, and mourning. While the plays share several thematic links and both emplot the relationship of mothers and children on a quest to find each other, the playwrights invert their use of maternal presence and absence. In Kushner’s play, an epic monologue performed by Homebody dominates the first twenty-one pages of the play.3 This seems like an onslaught of maternal presence, except that beyond being designated a “homebody,” the character is not initially presented with focus on her maternal role. Perhaps the word homebody, describing someone who stays at home, or prefers staying at home, calls out motherhood on some levels of signification—a mother is a woman whose body was your home. But the term homebody more commonly...",

      "abstract": "That we feel as well as reason, have qualms and inner delights as well as calculate, seems to be as well established as anything can be. Much of the conduct we praise and censure would be impossible if we didn't feel; it is possible to construct amusing stories about relations between computers because in them we find the analogue of reasoning; but the analogue of feeling is in them hard to discover and it is therefore hard to give such stories moral weight. The definition of the gentleman includes unwillingness to hurt the feelings of others; people often say today, in discussing some particular action or practice: 'It's all right so long as he/she/they isn't/aren't hurt'; and this doesn't usually mean hurt in the physical or sensational sense, and even if it does the physical hurt is resented on account of its bringing about or representing some psychic hurt. The headmaster's famous 'This hurts me more than it hurts you' may be humbug but it makes perfect sense. That in the world we feel jealous or angry or resentful or happy, or that we have feelings, strange, lamiliar, curious, hateful, desirable, seems beyond question, and of course it is. If claims and statements about feelings are not clear, nothing in our language is clear.",

Something else is already on. Something else is stirring.” [End Page 151] The kind of worrisome therapy to which various simulational psychologists subscribed themselves when they spoke to her was unmistakably narrative in nature. It sited the acquisition of maturity or the sure signs of strong mental health solely within the stealth capacity to get over or beyond the emotionality of one’s affairs. “They stare at me as I speak,” she said, “They stare because they are rarified enough to believe that if one truly perceives that one can tell the story and not bleed, then one is no longer feeble in this region, then one is cured even.” The woman herself found this proposition profoundly alluring, but she did not find it mooring, never mind the far more selective designation of “restorative.” “Is recognition of not bleeding enough?” she asked. “Is that even roughly what I need to know in this scenario? To slowly and orally repeat the traumas until I don’t treat them any longer as a wound--but rather only as a dead zone, as a lonely and isolated area of numbness?” The woman further confessed: “I know that I am not bleeding. Bleeding is the least of my reasons for dismay. Indeed, bleeding may be the easiest malfunction that I could dare to conceive of. The almost lovely straightforwardness with which once unleashed its redness pours forth in sheaves.” [End Page 152] Emily Abendroth Emily Abendroth is a writer and teacher currently residing in Philadelphia.

Her exceptional story is unusual because she hires protection agents not to protect her from what is considered the normal threats of kidnappers, stalkers, autograph seekers, but to protect her from herself and the violence she might do to others. The author describes the procedure she follows in selecting someone to protect her and those around her from herself, the protective person's responsibilities, questions she asks, her expectations, and experiences with protective personnel as she travels around the world giving lectures about her strange condition. Her story, though rare and unusual, pinpoints the finer aspects of selecting a protective team. Having more than one protection specialist on an assignment may be a wise decision on the part of the protectors, but this may also carry some issues of its own.",

      "abstract": "The daily strive to get to work and back home through traffic congestions; passing the day without conflicts; improving the life style when money is short; overcoming medical problems; raising and securing the family, and tolerating unfulfilled dreams are only a portion of constantly bothering issues. No wonder then that in this chaotic reality and despite various joyful and satisfying moments, the majority of grown-ups claim that they are unhappy. Amazingly, however, there are always those who believe and declare that they are happy, which raises the question what is happiness and what is it constituted from. Google suggests that “Happiness is that feeling that comes over you when you know life is good and you can’t help but smile. It’s the opposite of sadness. Happiness is a sense of well-being, joy, or contentment. When people are successful, or safe, or lucky, they feel happy”. This description combines a number of positive experiences and feelings, that most likely affect our brain to release chemicals recognized as the ‘good guys’, in contrast to the ‘bad guys’, chemicals secreted in situations of sadness, agony, pain, failures, disappointments and frustrations that affect brain circuits associated with unpleasant emotions and thoughts. Although moments of satisfaction, joy and pleasure raise good feelings, these are usually temporary, whereas happiness in its broader essence reflects a positive state of mind based on numerous parameters that collectively raise a long-lasting contentment. When a person claims he is happy, he probably disregards his difficulties and concentrates on a particular issue that makes him feel good (e.g., love, professional success, good health, overcoming a major difficulty, listening to beloved music, winning in sport).",

      "title": "When a Therapist Catches Despair",
      "abstract": "Despair has been a neglected and taboo subject in our field. This is a story about the therapist's own despair, and our reluctance to own and talk about it. Hope and despair are a therapist's constant companions. The price we pay for our optimism, our hope for the future, our belief in our own powers to help others, is that we must also live with the limits, disappointment and failures of our best efforts. We must maintain optimism even as we recognise the depths of our own discouragement with some clients who don't improve no matter how hard we work. What impact can we really have on people who are wracked with intractable, chronic problems and who will never really recover from traumas, illness or disorders from which they suffer? Some have problems so longstanding, so chronic and unremitting, so severe, that whatever we do seems like nothing but a token gesture. Yet hope and optimism can only be rekindled if therapists are given permission to admit the despair they experience on a daily level. In some ways, despair is an asset that heightens our ability to truly understand a client's experience. It also means that we live with such uncertainty and ambiguity about the nature of our work and its actual impact. (editor abstract)",

      "abstract": "Informed by my own experience of bearing witness to and being made vulnerable by a life-threatening event in a loved one, this essay draws on philosophical, psychological and narratological underpinnings to investigate the gap that exists between conventional narrative structures and the narratives employed by those with lived experience of trauma or critical illness. Overall, I argue that writers and other creative artists have a responsibility to represent trauma or illness in ways that resist the temporal unification, neat closures and trajectories that often present such events as disruptions to be overcome. Following this line of thinking I argue that narrative coherence is not dependent on the cohesion of a whole. Instead it relies on the shared understandings and the process of recognition that forms between the teller and recipient of a story. In other words, coherence is dependent on the recipient’s ability to read structural characteristics such as fragmentation, discontinuity, irresolution and uncertainty not as aberrations to narrative stability, but as potential signifiers of the trauma itself. As such I suggest creative professionals can do more to experiment with the language of trauma. I conclude with a personal reflection that illustrates how knowledge of this language allows for coherence even in the most fraught narratives.",

      "title": "Life “on holiday”?",
      "abstract": "There has been an increasing emphasis in narrative inquiry on “small” stories (i.e., those derived from everyday social exchanges) rather than “big” stories (i.e., those derived from interviews, clinical encounters, autobiographical writing, and other such interrogative venues). The latter, it may be argued, inevitably entail a problematic distance from everyday reality and may thus be said to embody life “on holiday.” On one level, this is surely true: big stories, insofar as they entail a significant measure of reflection on either an episode, a portion of a life, or the whole of it, are a step removed from those everyday goings-on that are the focus of small stories. Far from necessarily being a liability, however, the distance that is intrinsic to big story narrative reflection creates opportunities for understanding that are largely unavailable in the immediacy of the moment. Big stories and small stories thus complement one another; taken together, they represent a promising integrative direction for narrative inquiry.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence, the usually constructive transition from the world of childhood to adult, is sometimes at the origin of weakness resulting from puberty changes and the revival of emerging drives previously asleep. This movement is not always accompanied by desirable vitality since it confronts certain subjects to an impossible maturation, opening the prospect of suicide as a way out of this evolutionary impasse. An original elucidation of what Freud had earlier developed about the underlying mechanisms of some suicide attempts is proposed here in the light of the history of a patient whose repeated suicide attempts situate adolescence in a tension between a deadly process aiming at her destruction and an attempt at survival in the ultimate appropriation of herself.",

To achieve means “to carry out successfully (accomplish);” “to get or attain as a result of exertion (reach),” or “to attain a desired end or aim (to become successful).”2 To ascribe, on the other hand, comes from the restored spelling of the Middle English ascrive, etymologically derives from the Old French. ascrivre, \"to attribute, inscribe,\" and the Latin ascribere \"to write in, to add to in a writing,\" from ad- \"to\" + scribere \"to write.\"3 To ascribe is to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author, and “suggests an inferring of cause, quality or authorship” as in the case of “forged paintings formerly ascribed to masters.”4&#x0D; &#x0D; Achievement rightfully bestows an earned “headship,” implied in its etymology from the Old.French. achever \"to finish,\" from the phrase à chef (venir) \"at an end, finished,\" the Vulgate Latin *accapare, from the Latin ad caput (venire). Literally, both the Old.French and Latin phrases mean \"to come to a head,\" from the Latin caput \"head.”5 Ascription is flattery at best; but worse when self-generated and perpetuated. Are vicarious experiences that become “personal accomplishments,” casual visits and observations that become “further training and fellowships,” comments and editing (even supervisory positions) that metamorphose into “research and co-authorships” any different from the fictitious medals of a dictator? Awards beget awards. Those who are thus preceded by reputation may loom “larger than life.” Do such giants stand on feet of clay?&#x0D; &#x0D; Our circles are a microcosm of the nation and world around us. Public servants who believe the fictions crafted by themselves and their coutillons continue to claim the right to rule (rather than the obligation to serve). Are we dazzled by the dream?

The process of reconfiguring one's inner world to accommodate the void left by the absent person can be demanding. Ultimately, it forces anyone to reconceive who they are. This is the reason why the initial stage of loss is often split between the need for inner regeneration and the desire to remain faithful to the lost loved one. On the one hand, a person who becomes separated from his partner wishes to transcend the past so as to be free to strive into the future. On the other hand, he may feel slightly guilty about overcoming his loss.",

      "title": "On the Forms of Resistance in Latin America: Its 'Native' Moment",
      "abstract": "In the last fifteen years Latin America has been the scene of very different kinds of resistance and struggle. Each case is at the same time universal and singular; a condensation both of the major fault-lines of the system of domination and of particular local practices of power and expropriation--and of self-determination and autonomous political organization. Every people involved in struggle has its own means of expression and spaces where its project develops and is articulated. In some cases people burst onto the streets, take over public squares or schools, or block roads. In others they rely on silence, absence, invisibility. Masked faces and uncovered faces, metal weapons and wooden weapons, or just paper weapons--the power of printed images; marches and hunger strikes; the seizure of lands, or staying away from work. The reasons for the protests are as varied as their forms, and as motley and complex as the individuals who come together and dissolve again according to the circumstances and motives of each struggle. In face of such diversity, all have to remain open to change; so different are they that people must be content to agree on essentials; so numerous are they that they are able to surprise each other. Among all of these new modes of struggle the most significant has been that of Latin America's Indians, its native Americans. In constant interaction with a culture and a way of running the world based on relations of domination, appropriation through dispossession, and the predatory subordination of the environment, they are engaged in one of their modest processes of 'everyday' resistance, not always clear or explicit, but this time leading towards the assumption of a leading continent-wide role: a role which also involves a new perspective on the meaning of life and a new conception of social relations.",

      "title": "Article Breaking Out of One's Head (& Awakening to the World)",
      "abstract": "Herein, I review the moment in my life when I awoke from the dream of self to find being as part of the living world. It was a sudden, momentous event that is difficult to explain since transcending the self ultimately requires transcending the language structures of which the self consists. Since awakening to the world took place beyond the enclosure of self-speech, it also took place outside our symbolic construction of time. It is strange to place this event and its aftermath as happening long ago in my lifetime, for it is forever present; it surrounds me all the time just as the world seems to do. This fact puts into question the reality of my daily journey from dawn to dusk with all the mundane tasks I must complete (like writing of that which cannot be captured in writing). My linear march to aging and death inexorably continues, yet it seems somehow unreal, the biggest joke of all. Still, I here review the events leading up to my time out of mind and then review the serious repercussions when I was drawn back into the ego-self only to find I did not have the conceptual tools or the maturity to understand what had happened. Call to Adventure For the sake of structure (and because I owe so much of my psychological resurrection to the man’s writings), I will break apart this story and analysis into sections that accord with Joseph Campbell’s famous stages on the journey of the hero in his Hero of a Thousand Faces (1949/68). The hero’s journey is not a line of time going from past to future, but a circle that begins with the Call to Adventure, continues with crossing the Threshold from normal (social) reality into one much more dangerous but ripe with possibility. The hero must go through Tests, facing dangers (both fears and temptations), and heroes often fail. Then there is the Attainment (whether apotheosis or discovering of the treasure, etc.), followed by the Return back across that Threshold during which dangers of a different sort threaten while the adventurer attempts to reintegrate himself with society and with the selfidentity that the society has provided. For me, the whole circle is more like a twisting spiral, forever uncoiling from and recoiling toward an empty centre that can never really, in its essence, be recalled. Perhaps because it is always present.",

      "abstract": "There are three feelings that prompt a person to take their life: hopelessness, helplessness and worthlessness. Studies have found that the risk of suicide increases with decreasing happiness. In the recent past, people have been left clueless when celebrities and successful people ended their lives despite appearing overtly happy. What prompted them to do so? Modern society today highlights the importance of success over failure. Although we are motivated to be successful in life, it should not become our main gauge of happiness. In the same way we should not let success be our main goal in life and get discouraged by failure. Happiness has been viewed in two ways: as concerning the well-being of a person, and as the opposite of depression. Each one of us has different ways of measuring happiness. The quality of one’s happiness depends on one’s priorities in life. Happiness is not merely something that can be quantified with how much success and failure one has because such metric is very much subjective. How do we prevent a young life from extinguishing? How do we identify suicidal behavior among successful people and help those around? The present chapter covers the possible reasons why successful people commit suicide. Role of media in preventing suicide and measures for preventing suicide by successful people has been discussed.",

I felt a teary mist in my eyes and thought, “Now what?” Should I try to stay inside where he was and reflect again on his sadness, or should I back away by offering him a more cognitive level of dialogue? This question—whether to move in or out or, perhaps more accurately, to offer him the choice of where he feels most safe—is at the heart of some forms of psychotherapy.

      "abstract": "Time and again, it seems that the differences between people evoke specific emotional responses. Throughout history, people appear to have difficulty living peacefully with one another because of perceived differences. This is not an original observation, but as the world we live in continues to repeat the same old conflicts, sometimes involving new groups and sometimes not, it does seem important to examine this phenomenon. By asking the question, ‘What is it about difference?’ perhaps some light can be shed on the reasons underlying a struggle that seems to be fairly ubiquitous to the human condition, in one form or another. One person may feel less uncomfortable about racial differences, for example, but requires more of an effort to manage another human characteristic shared by a minority. I certainly feel that in my lifetime I have experienced many times, a conversation that goes along the lines of ‘I don’t have anything against group A, it’s group B, I can’t stand!’",

However, they do not always have the means to confront them and often settle in resignation, fears and indifference. The most disconcerting challenges seem to come or depend on the outside, rather than on oneself. However, the adoption of styles and projects of life as well as the practice of freedom is directly proportional to the principles and values which become great allies in the determination of their objectives, their integration into practical life and the construction of civility. In this process the reinforcement of their interiority based on the spirit of Christianity will be a key element in the exercise of civility.",

There has to be a start-point – a problem or question – then a body of evidence or argument, which leads to a conclusion. In other words, the writer needs a good story, and it now seems that throughout the history of leisure studies we have been searching for really good stories. There have been five main types of leisure narrative. There are \"full frontal\" stories about leisure; then stories about different types of leisure. The third type of story is about the leisure of a specific group – a gender, age or ethnic group or a social class, for example. The fourth story is about the different types of providers of leisure goods and services. Fifth and finally, there are stories about leisure as seen through the prisms of different social theories. We can debate, and there is no need to agree on, which kind of story is best. However, we may conclude, and the story in this paper is that we can conclude, that some stories have better endings than others.",

To capture that phenomenon, we might repurpose an old word: lapidation. Technically, the word is a synonym for stoning, but it sounds much less violent. It is also obscure, which makes it easier to enlist for contemporary purposes. Lapidation plays a role in affirming, and helping to constitute, tribal identity. It typically occurs when a transgressor is taken to have violated a taboo, which helps account for the different people and events that trigger left-of-center and right-of-center lapidation. One of the problems with lapidation is that it often accomplishes little; it expresses outrage, and allows people to signal their identity, but does no more. Victims of lapidation might be tempted to apologize, but apologies can prove ineffective or even make things worse, depending on the nature of the lapidators.",

It was a sudden, momentous event that is difficult to explain since transcending the self ultimately requires transcending the language structures of which the self consists. Since awakening to the world took place beyond the enclosure of self-speech, it also took place outside our symbolic construction of time. It is strange to place this event and its aftermath as happening long ago in my lifetime, for it is forever present; it surrounds me all the time just as the world seems to do. This fact puts into question the reality of my daily journey from dawn to dusk with all the mundane tasks I must complete (like writing of that which cannot be captured in writing). My linear march to aging and death inexorably continues, yet it seems somehow unreal, the biggest joke of all. Still, I here review the events leading up to my time out of mind and then review the serious repercussions when I was drawn back into the ego-self only to find I did not have the conceptual tools or the maturity to understand what had happened.",

We fear losing that individual, or relinquishing the social crutches that figuratively keep us alive and moving. The feminine and masculine can often speak to a familiar shared form of sadness, yet there are qualitative differences in the ways they perceive, interpret and react to the sadness that they find challenging or nearly impossible to communicate. Without this tangible and open communication, dissociations can form between the feminine and the masculine, the wife and the husband. In coupledom we can isolate ourselves to an unbearable degree, where we no longer know our other, let alone ourselves. The dissociative tendencies that arise from truths that are too distressing to keep secret yet too terrifying to share are patterns from which we wish to be free.",

Wanda Krause provides seven key ways to achieve happiness in the face of adversity and setbacks. She shows how it is possible through her own experience and learning, and through the wisdoms she's collected from her work of nearly two decades on individuals pursuing change and the \"good life\". The seven directives she discusses are: exit the thinking vortex, do the healing, pursue purpose, be broader systems intelligent, seek to learn, give yourself and others wellbeing and love, and change course. She argues that the practice of these steps is not just for overcoming obstacles and being happy, but that the world is in dire need of leaders who fight for what they know to be true, love, happiness, and peace with what is and a reality that is different. Setbacks are an inevitable part of life – in fact, of a life well lived. One does not get happy through the pursuit of happiness in and of itself; rather, it is in the pursuit of success, purpose, creating meaning, and in living the \"good life\"—happiness is the bonus, the side effect.",

      "title": "Meditation and the Search for God",
      "abstract": "MEDITATION AND THE SEARCH FOR GOD T IKE a neglected attic full of half-forgotten treasures, our L minds are stored with many familiar, but scarcely realized truths. They lie scattered about, a burden on our conscience, whispering reproaches at unexpected moments. They have not been laid aside because we are loathe to admit their uselessness and throw them out, but because we are too preoccupied with the novelties of the moment to pay them any attention. We plan to take a day off sometime and put the storeroom in order. Some things we shall discard; others we shall bring downstairs again and put to active use. Yet for one reason or another we never have a day free, and so the cluttered contents of our minds remain to haunt us. Now and again unexpected circumstances force us to hunt out something we need at the moment; the difficulty of finding it sharpens our resolve-also for the moment. One such truth, too often overlooked in the rush of activity, is the pervading importance of God in human life. The fact of God's existence is the background of western civilization and the heart of the Christian religion. The obligation of men to search for God and the assurance of the possibility of finding Him are the two most impressive realities of human living. Two of the most critical questions a man can ask are, Who made me? Why was I made? The two most significant answers are, God made me-to know and love Him, to serve Him here and to be happy with Him hereafter. These are the only answers that make sense; with them in mind all others sound hollow. Wealth or poverty, fame or obscurity, power or weakness, health or sickness, pleasure or pain, all these become accidental manifestations of the fundamental reality of a human life turned God-wards; they are meaningful only as helps or hindrances in the search for God. 450 MEDITATION AND THE SEARCH FOR GOD 451 If these be the true answers (and we must assume that they are in this paper) we must then admit that the attic or storeroom is no place for them; they are not heirlooms to be displayed only when we expect a visit from our maiden aunt. Without them our house is only a front, less real than a movieset . A polite acceptation of these truths or a reluctant admission of them to our living-rooms is not sufficient; indeed, it is an insult, for such truths as these cannot be merely tolerated; they are imperious, demanding, leaving us little time to pay attention to others. If then we have hidden them in our attic, or grudgingly given them a corner of our living-room, we have as yet not recognized their import. I A man searching for God-what does it mean? Does it make any more sense than the picture of a man looking for the needle in the hay-stack, or that of a child grasping for the mercury from a broken thermometer? God is pure spirit, infinitely transcendent, supernaturally perfect. Can the bungling efforts of a creature ever get on the track of God, much less actually find Him? Where should he look? How can he tell that he is on the right track? How will he know that he has found God? What does it mean to find God? This is the key question; when we know the answer to it, we shall know how to look for God. It is true that God is a perfect being infinitely superior to any of His creatures. He is the only one Who is completely self-sufficient, perfectly happy in the possession of His own goodness; in fact, He can never be unhappy, for He can never lose possession of Himself. If He willed, He could keep that goodness to Himself, or He can give a share of it to others besides Himself; He can even give Himself, His undivided goodness to others. This He has promised to men, that He will give them, not His gifts alone, however great, but Himself. On the assurance of God then we believe that we...",

      "abstract": "The psychological symptom of the trauma evolves with times. It preserves its original elements and obtains new symptoms in each specific age. Because the lived experiences become more and more complicated, the trauma performs multiple manifestations as well, continually breaking human beings’ taken-for-granted and over-dependent thinking modes. Dealing with the increasing traumatic symptoms, people learn that they should treat lived experiences and memories from varied perspectives, and that they should not cling obstinately to single principles or thinking modes. Although the trauma cannot be represented by language or words, it is useless to insistently repress traumatic memories. After analyzing the linguistic issues in The Giver, I think that different consciousnesses, through the incessant sharing and communication, can interact with each other, digging out the possibilities of life granted by traumatic experiences. Besides, the traumatic memory shows up repeatedly in the mind of the traumatic subject, making his history and memory interrupted and stagnated. However, in Waiting for Godot, the standstill history and memory make traumatic subjects get rid of the linear time and acquire multiple perspectives for observing the remnant traces of history and memory. In the age of technology, modern people willingly fall into the snare made by the technological ideology, getting stuck in the traumatic situation without awareness. Human faculties are replaced by technological products; human body is marked, infiltrated, and manipulated by technology. However, modern people, with the assistance of technology, can find more methods to observe the world and create more colorful lived experiences.",

      "abstract": "reviews 174 or many years—a generation, almost—I refused to read books in which children died. This was less an aesthetic stance than a survival strategy. Or no, not a strategy: that seems far too conscious. I was operating on more instinctive terms. My catalyst was the weightlessness I felt upon becoming a parent, a state for which I was (how could it be otherwise?) entirely unprepared. I had imagined family as the safest of harbors; it was the expected, the conventional choice. From the outside it appeared if not orderly than at least trackable, a series of quantifiable movements, bound by the rigidity of scheduling: feedings, naptime, baths, and bed. idea in review The Unthinkable Writing about the death of children David L. Ulin F The Unthinkable | 175 Then my wife got pregnant with our first child, and the illusion, projective as it was, began to grow increasingly complex. First there was the specter of my own upbringing, the polarities, the brittleness I did not wish to re-­ create. “I fear,” I wrote in a journal entry a few weeks before our son was born, “that I’ll become the fragile, alienated parent I rebelled against.” After the baby arrived, I discovered more encompassing concerns. Such as: How do you protect a small, dependent creature? How do you teach him to protect himself? Have a second child and the stakes grow expo­ nentially. “Please, please, let me keep them,” Marion Winik writes in The Lunch-­ Box Chronicle: Notes from the Parenting Underground, recalling the horror of losing, temporarily, her young sons in a market. I offer a version of this prayer every day. What Winik is addressing is the unspoken subtext at the heart of parenting: What if my children disappear? That she doesn’t quite put that fear into language only illustrates the depth of the conundrum. How do we reckon with a terror we are hesitant even to name? I don’t want to make the argument that discussing the death of a child is taboo, exactly; throughout human history, dead offspring have been an unavoidable currency of life. In Elizabethan England, as an example, 60 percent of children died before they turned sixteen. All the same, we no longer live in the sixteenth cen­ tury, and in any case, such percentages have nothing to do with grief. Much like love, sorrow remains a private matter, a condition we have no choice but to face on its own terms. “It occurs to me,” Marisa Silver writes, “that a child is something that gets stolen bit by bit. A two-­ year-­ old dissolves into a five-­ year-­ old, and no pic­ ture can adequately bring back the feel of him, the sound of his voice, and all the intangible qualities that made him himself at that moment. A ten-­ year-­ old becomes fifteen, then seventeen. Then he slips out of your life altogether.” Even in the best of circumstances, in other words, we raise our children so they can move on. Here we see one reason I avoided works involving dead or dying children: perhaps by refusing to acknowledge such a possibility, I might also deflect the small daily erasures of parenthood, of family—or hold 176 | David L. Ulin them in their place. Please, please, let me keep them: for me, these are the emotional stakes of raising kids. As to why this is, in part it is my weakness. In part it is the certainty that I would be incapacitated by the claustrophobia of grief. “My brain burns,” Naja Marie Aidt mourns in When Death Takes Something from You Give It Back; “it cannot get these extreme opposites to fit together; it cannot get this information to form a sequence, one story, the story we will have to live with for the rest of our lives.” The author is referring to the death of her son Carl Emil, who jumped from a fifth-­ story window while high on psilo­ cybin; he was twenty-­ five. My son—the child I was once so wor­ ried I might alienate—is also twenty-­ five now, and when he was nineteen and twenty and twenty-­ one and twenty-­ two...",

      "title": "The Professional's Last Will and Testament.",
      "abstract": "Unlike anticipated employee departures, death of a key staff member, as unexpected, as it is unwelcome, presents a new and unanticipated series of organizational challenges. Among these are impact such loss has upon survivors in organization as well as continuity of organizational functions. The Professional's Last Will and Testament is a transition plan that anticipates sudden loss of a key colleague. In this article, a case study illustrates initial issues arising from sudden death of key personnel and then offers an outline for Professional's Last Will and Testament. This document includes attention to logistical issues and planning for organizational change. It begins with short-term transition issues and continues through other, longer-term issues that must be considered. Even those of us who work in or around death education and counseling sometimes take life for granted until a crisis hits home and invites questions. (Wolfelt, 2002a, p. 1) When was last time you contemplated your own mortality? It may have been events of September 11, 2001, loss of Columbia spacecraft, or threat or occurrence of war and terrorism that brought thoughts of mortality to mind. For some, death of a close friend or family member brings this mortality to forefront. Such reflections seldom include likely impact of our own death or that of a colleague upon workplace. Rut sobering notion of death should be cause for managers in every setting to consider compiling a transition plan, a Professional's Last Will and Testament, for all key staff members. We will leave our current positions and that leaving will be cause for organizational as well as personal transition. Ideally this transition will be an orderly one and our legacy will be clear. While employers understand that employees dream about time when they will take retirement, leave for the perfect job or possibly (but far less likely in these stressful economic times) simply resign, these possibilities carry with them comforting notion that we will have time to anticipate these events with reasonable notice and an opportunity to ready ourselves and organization for vacancy. In such anticipated departures, there is usually time to set our affairs in some sort of order. We seldom need to spend time thinking about specific and detailed transition plans until departure is announced, generally with several weeks notice. Pew administrators or staff members realistically contemplate very substantial impact an employee departure due to unanticipated death would have upon their organization. Different from expected death of a colleague who has been terminally ill for an extended period, sudden death of a colleague brings with it a retinue of unwelcome challenges. Among these are impact such loss has upon survivors in organization as well as continuity of organizational functions. The Professional's Last Will and Testament is a means of clarifying intent and preserving legacy inherent in a professional's life. This article presents information on issues to consider in responding to sudden loss of personnel, a case study of such loss, and recommendations for issues that must be considered in creation of Professional's Last Will and Testament. Review of Literature The literature yields little on topic of planning for transition in advance of employee loss. Some professional literature concerns itself with how to close a practice or retire with notice to clients (Bernstein & Hartsell, 2000) as well as how to dispose of confidential records following death of a therapist or other provider (Bernstein & Hartsell, 1998). Research in loss and grief concerns how individuals who suffer sudden loss will be dealing with emotions and transitions as an important part of recovery. Alan D. Wolfelt, Director of Center for Loss and Life Transition and faculty member at University of Colorado Medical School's Department of Family Medicine, believes that we should recognize that grief is unique to each individual, that we need to talk about our grief and should be prepared for a multitude of emotions. …",

      "title": "The Brexit poll, part two",
      "abstract": "As a clinical psychologist, I’ve spent a lot of time talking to people who are feeling emotional. It’s a large part of the job. And when we’re emotional, it’s hard to think things through properly. Indeed, that’s one of the main ideas behind cognitive therapy.\r\n\r\nIf there was ever a time when we needed to think something through clearly, it was last week – when we had to decide how to vote in the EU referendum – and now, when we are dealing with the aftermath. The importance of the issues – the events of 2016 will likely have a profound effect on UK life for generations to come – is matched only by their complexity. As a psychologist I worry that some of our voting decisions – and indeed the referendum result – may have been partly the product of emotional thinking. Recent political and economic events have left many people feeling stressed, depressed, anxious, hopeless and adrift. Many have lost their jobs with the closure of traditional industries, and with them often their sense of identity and belonging. Buying or even renting a home is often out of reach, people have lost faith in politicians and feel disenfranchised, local shops and pubs have closed leaving people isolated. Many are struggling even to afford the basics: wages are low and unpredictable or they may be just getting by on benefits. Some have to rely on food banks and have felt humiliated by the experience. We worry for our own and our children’s future. Emotions are running high.\r\n\r\nIn this context, many of us will have found the oversimplified stories put out by both sides, but particularly in my view by the ‘out’ campaign, much more convincing than we might otherwise have done. It’s well documented that in extremis, people look for someone to blame: the processes of ‘scapegoating’ and ‘othering’ are well documented in social psychology. So the stories are seductive: our problems are due to an influx of foreigners threatening our livelihoods and our public services, and to paper-shuffling, ineffectual Brussels eurocrats siphoning off billions from our national coffers. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I’m thinking emotionally myself, but I’m very worried about our future. There are huge echoes for me of earlier periods in our European history when people blamed their problems on ‘foreigners’ in their midst. The racist attacks that have been reported in the days since the referendum are deeply troubling. The 1930s and 1940s are very present in my mind. And as we know, it didn’t end well. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as a ‘remain’ voter I’m only too aware of the danger of othering and scapegoating people who voted to leave. That way lies huge danger too. Maybe I’m even guilty of doing that here. As psychologists we need to put our energies into helping heal, rather than worsening the rifts that this process has opened up between people. But then I’m feeling emotional. Our awareness of psychological processes doesn’t make us immune. But it should make us careful. \r\n\r\nAnne Cooke is a Consultant Clinical Psychologist and Principal Lecturer at Canterbury Christ Church University.",

      "title": "Living With Ease: A Psychological View",
      "abstract": "“When we are relaxed and happy, there is a gentle rhythm back and forth between the two branches [of the nervous system], undulating between automatic charge and discharge, and between arousal and relaxation. This gentle rhythm gives us a sense of well-being and success in managing our lives.” - Gina Ross, Beyond the Trauma Vortex, Into the Healing Vortex. Living with ease doesn’t mean sleeping late every day, becoming a beach bum, or forgetting the responsibilities. Although these may be helpful short term practices to balance over-exertion. living with ease requires a delicate balance that includes both relaxation and alertness. If over-relaxed on a regular basis that will slump into sleepiness or inertia. If being too alert, is felt wound up and ready to snap. Everyday life, daily life or routine life comprises the ease living the ways in which people typically act, think, and feel on a daily basis.Standard of living refers to the level of wealth, comfort, material goods, and necessities available to a certain socioeconomic class in a certain geographic area, usually a country. The standard of living includes factors such as income, quality and availability of employment, class disparity, poverty rate, quality and affordability of housing, hours of work required to purchase necessities, gross domestic product, inflation rate, amount of leisure time every year, affordable (or free) access to quality healthcare, quality and availability of education, life expectancy, incidence of disease, cost of goods and services, infrastructure, national economic growth, economic and political stability, political and religious freedom, environmental quality, climate and safety. The standard of living is closely related to quality of life Every individual varies in terms of the amount of stimulation he or she needs, wants, or can tolerate. The same goes for relaxation. Living with ease means finding one’s own sweet spot, which blends a good mix of serenity with a sense of being awake in the world.",

D'une manière générale, ces investigations n'ont permis d'identifier qu'un petit nombre de défunts parce que les tribunaux ne disposent pas de ressources nécessaires pour mener des enquêtes approfondies, ou parce que les besoins en matière de preuve n'imposent pas d'identifier toutes les victimes. Entre-temps, les familles des personnes portées disparues sont laissées dans l'incertitude d'une «perte ambiguë», déchirées entre l'espoir et le chagrin, incapables de revenir sur le passé ou de se tourner vers l'avenir. Sans dépouille et sans funérailles, elles sont souvent dans l'incapacité de visualiser le décès de l'être cher et d'en accepter la réalité. En application du Protocole additionnel I aux Conventions de Genève de 1949, les familles ont le droit de connaître le sort de leurs proches. Afin de faciliter l'exercice de ce droit, il conviendrait de créer un réseau international d'experts légistes qui serait chargé d'élaborer et de diffuser des lignes directrices et des normes pratiques, ainsi que de coordonner les enquêtes humanitaires sur le sort des personnes portées disparues. Le réseau devrait être guidé par le principe qu'il est tout aussi important d'identifier les disparus que de recueillir des preuves pour les enquêtes pénales.",

      "abstract": "__________________________________________________ We often treat our basic, unmotivated desires as reason-giving: you’re thirsty and take yourself to have a reason to walk to the drinking fountain; you care intrinsically about your young daughter and take yourself to have a reason to feed and clothe her. We (behave as though we) think these desires generate normative practical reasons. But are there (satisfiable) basic desires that don’t? It might seem so, for we sometimes find ourselves impelled to do some very strange, and some very awful, things. For example, would a loving mother with a violent impulse thereby come to have a reason to harm her beloved child? Let’s grant, for the sake of argument, that there are (satisfiable) basic desires, such as the mother’s, that fail to generate reasons. Can a subjectivist, a theorist in the Humean tradition, accept this thesis? Against the historical grain, I argue yes. I frame my discussion in terms of solving a puzzle in Harry Frankfurt’s subjectivist theory of rational agency and appeal to the concept of a personal ideal to reveal how a subjectivist, a follower of Hume, can countenance the existence of “rationally impotent basic desires.”",

      "title": "Twilight: Losing Sight, Gaining Insight",
      "abstract": "My years with failing vision have prompted me to learn about the nature of the eye and the incredible gift of sight, which I had always taken for granted until it began to slip away. But I also learned about living within limits and overcoming disability. This, then, is not merely a story about seeing but also about living. It is a story not merely about losing sight but about gaining insight as well. I was far from alone. I found myself observing details of behavior in people that would not have caught my attention while my eyesight was normal. I noticed when someone was particularly careful walking down steps or when someone else was holding a menu very close to his eyes or looking at me in a somewhat vague, unfocused manner. Before long, I realized that these were signs of degeneration. Many people tried to hide it. Most were reluctant to talk about the real problem. But others, when they found out that I was also a macular degenerate, were eager to compare our experiences. I began to feel that I was joining, involuntarily, a secret society. Living with degeneration means living in a half-veiled world. I can still see a sunrise, mountains, buildings, can, in fact, see almost everything-but as if through a scrim. I often have difficulty identifying people. Arriving one evening at a Chinese restaurant in New York with family and friends, I walked up to what I took to be the maitre d' and tried to shake hands. My son tapped me on the shoulder and said, Who's your friend, Dad? The large statue of a monkey did not return my greeting. I find that often I don't even recognize old friends and seem to cut them dead; at other times, I greet total strangers as old friends. Just to be on the safe side, I now return any greeting with enthusiasm, which usually pleases and sometimes puzzles acquaintances. One of the difficulties about degeneration is that those around you can never be sure what you see, and you yourself are not sure, either. Reading faces and the signals of mood and temper, which I had taken for granted as part of the art of seeing, has become extremely difficult except when I'm inches away. Eye contact is nearly impossible, which eliminates a vital form of communication. When my granddaughter Elizabeth went through a shy period and relied on smiles and nods to respond, my daughter firmly explained to her that I needed to hear her voice because I could not see her expression. Sometimes I seem abstracted to people-out of the moment, as my children put it-but, in fact, I have learned to compensate by listening more attentively than ever, and I can quickly make out fatigue, sadness, or anger from someone's voice. I have trained myself to look in the direction of voices. The eye enables us to reach out into life. It means freedom, independence. The lack of that independence is disheartening. Many people's reaction to degeneration is denial. They continue to handle money without being able to see it clearly, stab at the wrong elevator buttons, and even drive cars far beyond the point of safety. I also went through such a period. I would wake up in the morning, turn off the alarm clock, and open my eyes. Everything would be in place: the windows and doors, mirrors, desk, dressing table. It all looked a little hazy, but that seemed natural in the subdued morning light. I would get out of bed, put on my glasses, and pick up the day's paper, looking at it, hard. The words were a blur. For moments, I simply refused to believe that I could not read. The need to ask for help was at first excruciating. Eventually, I had to change my attitude, however reluctantly. I move around New York as much as ever, but with a healthy caution crossing streets. I slavishly wait for the light to change (I can usually see that) even if there is no traffic, and I have taken to crossing alongside other pedestrians-especially women with baby carriages, next to whom I feel safe. …",

In the absence of these interactions, alone in my flat, I've been thinking of the comfort that comes from not having my ideas challenged, although we continue our learning digitally, it feels stunted. Without our community we must travel a road upon which our own ideas are absolute and this I believe limits the learning experience.

In this chapter, we offer three themes that that emerged as means to resolve suffering or to protect themselves from experiencing suffering despite distress. They are: (1) having goals, (2) sharing the power of the family story and (3) maintaining friendships with other African-American men. The three themes were often interrelated in men’s accounts. Men interviewed for this research revealed the importance of looking toward the future with hope and plans in hand, keeping previous generations alive through reminiscence and, seeking friendship with other men, particularly during caregiving (Black, 2015; Mattis et al., 2001) and showed older African-American male caregivers to be involved in reciprocal friendships with other men, which one man described as “what keeps me going.”",

      "abstract": "When I first considered the role of silence in forming alliances, the idea of writing about silence was intriguing and freeing. As I pondered silence, my body overtook my usual controlled, linear, and deliberate writing process. It had something to say about silence that my mind couldn’t contain. The more I focused on thinking, the more belligerent my body became. I squirmed in my chair and my eyes glazed over as I stared at the computer screen. No matter how forcefully my academic mind struggled to identify the perfect theory or compelling moment that I might neatly insert into a linear essay, corporeality hounded me, pushing me into silence. Only through an unexpected blurring of boundaries brought on by the disruption of the Cartesian mind/body split, and after hours of sitting in the silence of my discomfort, did I realize that longings for silence and bringing silence into words is messy, confusing, contradictory. John R. Barrie (2008) states that “When all mental ruminations are at last exhausted, genuine silence emerges” (p. 10). So, after days and weeks of struggling through thoughts, I immersed myself in silence and turned to my body for the knowledge I sought. I closed my eyes, breathed deeply, and turned my attention to my physical and emotional bodies to learn what they might show me about the silence that resides there. I catapulted out of the here and now into a conflated momentum where past, future, and present merged. Time shifted and I lost my “self” ... floating between yesterday and today, here and there, wholeness and fragmentation. Feeling drove me. Rage and joy surged, washing over me, unexpectedly driving energy to the keyboard. Thoughts emerged: I found myself anxious that the privileged whining of a 40-something, middle-class, white academic would consume the coexisting cellular reality of a trans1 identified, gender queer, fat",

      "abstract": "enduring emotion of war, when else has faded, is comradeship. [. . .] Individual possessions and advantage count for nothing: group is everything. What you have is shared with your friends. It isn't a particularly selective process, but a love that needs no reasons, that transcends race and personality and education - those things that would make a difference in peace. It is, simply, brotherly love. (Broyles, Why Men Love War, 58)Standing naked taking a whiz in public was least of our atrocities; such were broad and generous permissions in field. A modern army does not want warriors, you understand, it wants killers, capable of berserk viciousness. And our shame there was a lot of ?looking other way.' (Heinemann, after All These Years, 10)In early 80s, Vietnam War veteran and writer William Broyles, Jr. received great gift that many vets long for years after their war has ended, when they have had innumerable hours reflect upon most pivotal event in their lives: he unexpectedly happened upon his closest war buddy. The two were simultaneously touring Vietnam War memorial when they met again over a decade after they parted on battlefield, swearing they would never lose track of one another, which they eventually did. The sentimentality and nostalgia evoked by chance meeting could have been played out in a cliched war movie, with audience wondering how two individuals, among thousands of veterans, unintentionally ended up at same spot at exact same time. Willing suspend their disbelief, audience overlooks odds and falls comfortably into scene's romance - specific and unmistakable romance that exists between two former combat soldiers. This reunion results in a visit war buddy's (Heirs') home in Vermont, a bed-and-breakfast that he runs with his wife. Amid snow-capped mountains and serene landscape, Broyles remembers how he and Heirs spent their first morning in his rustic barn trying save five newborn, motherless rabbits. Heirs had anxiously been monitoring creatures even before Broyles' arrival, and, Broyles noticed, had gingerly constructed a nest of rabbit fur and installed a heat lamp to provide warmth against bitter cold (Broyles 55). Broyles purposely highlights Heirs' peaceful (and arguably feminine) manner, as well as his own, rebut popular cliches of Vietnam veterans as disgruntled, hair-trigger Rambo-like men, capable of only brute force and outlandish behavior. Then, Broyles intentionally disrupts his carefully crafted scene with Heirs' startling admission. As he gently places each rabbit into his makeshift nest, he reveals Broyles what bothers him most about his war experience: ?What people can't understand, [. . .] is how much fun Vietnam was. I loved it. I loved it, and I can't tell anybody' (55).The surprising comment from his maddeningly insubordinate radio operator (55) turned picture-perfect family man prompted Broyles (Heirs' former lieutenant), write his now famous essay, Why Men Love War, in which he seeks explain man's purported love of war in once and for all fashion. He starts by confessing his own love for battle, despite fact that he would never want fight again, and would do everything in [his] power (56) prevent his son from experiencing horrors he endured. Supposing that his claim could be hotly contested, Broyles quickly rejects that he loves war for frivolous reasons, for romantic notion of combat, or the mindless bliss of martyrdom (56). He also assures reader that for him war was not an addiction, as it was for crazies mailing ears home their girlfriends, zoomies who couldn't get an erection unless they were cutting in afterburners on their F-4s (56). Broyles then offers his reasons for loving war (reasons he assumes are shared by men). Many of these assertions, however, prove problematic when juxtaposed with numerous narratives from other veterans, many of whom conceded that they were their worst possible selves during combat and remain traumatized due carnage they saw, or, in more troubling cases, incited. …",

It has been a struggle, in some ways, more than the previous year. We have had to deal with the pandemic numbers climbing, the indecisive leadership, the loss of colleagues and family members, the loss of jobs, more work and more barriers to getting that work done, stress and incivility, and on and on. Colleagues have experienced fear for their children. There are children (and adults) who are afraid to go out in public, afraid they may contract the virus or pass it on with disastrous results. Colleagues are experiencing combative students in the classroom who call them out for wearing a mask. Through it all is the uncertainty—of the future, the economy, having a job (still! Not just due to COVID but to changes in leadership and to political maneuvering). It sometimes gets to be too much. Then I saw a sign. Literally.",

      "abstract": "Fear From the beginning, they learned not to feel any. They're usually good people, praised by neighbors, Quick to shovel snow from the walkways. They're reliably cheerful, even with telemarketers, And their houses are clean from Monday to Sunday. But it's hard to picture them at night, unable to rest, Sick from the latest on Iraq and Afghanistan. Name a current war, and they imagine terrorists And despots, not toddlers who can't understand That they mustn't cry because everything depends on it. Ambiguity is all they can't tolerate. Stories without resolution, abstract portraiture- Why stir things up for the hell of it? They're willing to discuss the new counterculture, Even read a book you suggest, but as they see it, The past is over. If they were unloved by their mothers Or shouted into submission at every stage Of development, they're fully recovered. If others keep having kids they can't raise And quitting jobs, it's from lack of resolve, or bad culture. They're glad to explain their position: We overcame, too. Our parents used to be poor. One of them was violent. We were brought up on unspoken racism and junk food But turned out OK and not racist. Hey, we're resilient. We triumphed over rocky beginnings. And so can you. [End Page 99] Things Chinese Once, I tried to banish them all from my writing. This was America, after all, where everyone's at liberty To remake her person, her place, or her poetry, And I lived in a town a long way from everything Where discussions of \"diversity\" Centered mainly on sexuality. My policy, born of exhaustion with talk about race And the quintessentially American wish for antecedents, Eliminated most of my family, starting with the grandparents, Two of whom stayed Chinese to their final days, Two of whom were all but defined by their expertise On the food of the country I was trying to excise. It canceled out the expensive center Of an intense undergraduate curriculum And excluded the only foreign language I could talk in. It wiped out my parents' earliest years And converted them to 1950s Georgians Who'd always attended church and school, like anyone. My father had never paused at two water fountains And asked a white man which he should drink from, And never told his children what the answer had been. My mother had never arranged a migration, Solo at seventeen, from Taipei to wherever, But had simply appeared in Gainesville out of ether, [End Page 100] And nothing about their original languages Had brought them together. Their children Had never needed to explain to anyone Why distinctness and mystery were not advantages When they were not optional, and never wondered If particular features had caused particular failures. For months I couldn't write anything decent Because banned information kept trying to enter Like bungled idioms in the speech of a foreigner. I was my own totalitarian government Or an HMO that wouldn't pay for a specialist, And I was the dissident or patient who perished. The hope was to transcend the profanity of being Through the dissolution of description and story, Which I thought might turn out to be secondary To a semi-mystical state of unseeing, But everywhere I went there was circumstance, All of it strangely tainted by my very presence. Creation All those months I tried to save sleep like money, and reread the manuals. Who did I think I was? [End Page 101] So many before me had never turned back, surely it was paradise - or a black hole. When I was seventeen I knew the fight was for art or nothing, and while I surely knew something, it wasn't the meaning of nothing. Everyone's mother could have been someone. Now that it's happened, I no longer fear my middle name, woman under a roof. Here on earth, a complete escape from abstraction. Either you're there or you aren't. The...",

The beginning of the twenty-first century has been marked by multiple financial crises, a pandemic, in addition to new and endless wars. Above and beyond it all, the ecological crisis has changed the way humans think of themselves, the world, and the future. How do we live and live on when the very prospect of a future is uncertain? How do we raise new generations to become independent citizens of the world if we cannot promise a future where such a world exists? Drawing on an ethnographic and interview-based study of young climate activists in The Green Youth Movement (Den grønne ungdomsbevægelse) in Denmark, this article explores the role of hope for our dealings with the ecological crises in general, and for young climate activists in particular. I argue that genuine hope—distinguished from naïve optimism, presupposes a confrontation with limitations, and is intimately related to grief, action and care.",

      "abstract": "Most of us don't seek advice or reach out to others for help very easily. In part, it's because we're conditioned to see life as an individual endeavor rather than a team sport. Or because we believe that asking for help makes us look weak or incapable. We regard self-help as by-yourself-help. News flash: no one in the history of the world has ever achieved any level of happiness or success totally by themselves. In his 1976 book The Long Run Solution, Joe Henderson suggested that becoming truly accomplished at running (or at anything) doesn't typically require us to perform superhuman feats. In fact, success is frequently realized by those who simply do the things anyone can do that most of us never will. In What Anyone Can Do, with the help of Leo Bottary's Year of the Peer podcasts guests (and playful illustrations by Ryan Foland), you'll discover that if you surround yourself with the right people, you'll do the things anyone can do far more often. And when you do that, you and the people around you will realize more of what you want out of business and life. It's that simple. The Power of Peers (2016) made a strong case for how and why formal peer groups are so effective. This book steps outside the formal peer group arena to examine all the important relationships we have in our lives (parents, teachers, spouses, mentors, children, mentees, etc.) and provides a practical approach and specific framework for harnessing their power for your benefit (and theirs). It's what anyone can do. You're anyone, right?",

War and violence are for sure two of the most serious traumatic events, as they are long-termed, cause different kinds of injuries, fear, unsafety, and hopelessness – and this is the first stress migrants are faced with. By being concerned for their own or the lives of their families, many migrants agree to be smuggled. But smugglers offer inhumane and often intolerable conditions, placing more migrants in their vehicle or boat than it can receive, and this leads to many migrants' lives being lost. In situations of fear, hopelessness, and uncertainty, which migrants running away from, they are vulnerable to many risks, and one of them is human trafficking, which can occur during their trip, illegal migration, or even when they get the final destination. It is important to understand the difference between smuggling and human trafficking.",

That why, our ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn can be hindered by the images that feed these patterns. The ability to approach a positive stimulus (e.g., a pleasant food) and retreat from a negative stimulus (e.g., fleeing from danger) is of considerable importance in the survival of the individual . However, it is sometimes necessary to resist these natural tendencies in order to resolve difficult situations (e.g., approaching a fire for a firefighter) or to stay away from temptation (e.g., staying away from a pack of candy).

      "title": "Living Above Average",
      "abstract": "The Christian walk is never a straight course, it has challenges and obstacles that try to stop one from attaining the dream that God has placed before them.So many times as humans we allow our minds to be dominated with doubt and discouragement because of the disadvantages our life seems to bring. It all comes through shortness of revelation and through a misunderstanding of the infinite grace of God, and of the God of all grace, who is willing to give to all who will reach out the hand of faith. However,these disadvantages serve only to spur us on to greater victories if we refuse to be discouraged by them. This book intends to be an encouragement and a source of Inspiration to all who may encounter different obstacles in their Christian walk, who will not settle for less than what Christ has prepared for them. It seeks to show that when you stretch, you become more flexible. Becoming more flexible allows you to do some things you were never able to do before, the kind of faith you never had before. It seeks to encourage us that we can never be ordinary from the day we receive this life from above!",

      "title": "Open Letter on Empowerment and Queer Pron",
      "abstract": "There is nothing inherently empowering about making porn or showing the naked female (or any gendered) body on stage. The empowering part I believe, is primarily based in our freedom to explore what we are actually interested in, asking ourselves about life, and what we love to do. This could include, but is not limited to, discovering that we are exhibitionists or artists and/or that we enjoy exploring our sexuality with lots of different kinds of people. The freedom to explore these things – without feeling pressure from speculations about our gender or sexual orientation and without feeling shame about what we are publicly “allowed” to do or express out loud as those genders and orientations – deflates the imagined magnitude of what it is to show our bodies’ sexuality in public.",

      "abstract": "Abstract While Abby fails to communicate, I examine her language with all my attention. As soon as minimal communication occurs, I ignore her language and all my attention slides through it, past it, to the meaning, to the nonlinguistic reality, to the question of whether to call the hospital. When the glass is fogged up, we look at the glass. The glass is all we can see. As soon as it gets unfogged, we ignore it and see through it to the scene outside. You will help your writing if you can find occasions when the job you are doing matters a lot but the quality of the writing doesn’t matter at all-occasions when you pay no attention to the glass and look only at the scene beyond it. A good example is if you are trying to make up your mind about which of two jobs to take and after sitting and stewing and not getting anywhere for a few days, you finally decide to spend a couple of hours writing out all your thoughts and feelings. You don’t try to make an orderly presentation or argument, you just write and write until your thoughts and",

      "title": "Icons and Glory",
      "abstract": "Name your three best friends, and then name the three nations that you most admire. This test for self-knowledge generally reveals the discrepancy between the truly significant others in our lives and what we esteem as the great and glorious nations. Generally, the three most significant and dear persons in our lives are not particularly wealthy, or powerful or prestigious, or from ‘superior’ ethnic backgrounds. Yet still we persist in identifying glory with manifest power, a fact which underscores the urgent need for Christians to recapture a proper understanding of “glory’, now almost obscured by the modem secular notion of power. For surely it is our Christian conviction that the glory of God has been revealed in the poverty of Christ? God speaks his word of hope and love in human images (in Greek eikones —‘icons’), sacraments or ‘efficacious signs’ which move our hearts and enlighten our minds. We cannot do what we cannot at least in some way imagine or envision. We cannot believe, hope and love—our most significant ‘doing’—without enabling images (’icons’, in other words) or sacraments. We cannot perform the deeds of faith and hope and love without the living icons that constitute orientations to action. The Eternal Word of God became flesh in the perfect image of God that is Jesus Christ, in order to transform all human hearts and minds, enabling us through the gift of his Spirit to love God above all and our neighbour as ourselves. Jesus Christ and his Church are the sacrament or efficacious sign of God’s creative and sustaining and predestining activity in the universal, human story, making possible our responding love and faith and hope in God. The Christian community affirms that it has seen or experienced the ‘glory’ of God in his perfect image Jesus Christ, for the glory is the impact of God’s active presence transforming our lives.",

Famine and war evoke strong emotional reactions, and for most people there is a limited amount they can do. But the relief worker has to convert emotional responses into practical action and difficult choices - whom to help and how. Their own feelings have to motivate action for others. But can they separate out their own selfish feelings and prejudices in such an emotive climate? How do they avoid being partial among those they are helping? Are they motivated by altruistic concern, or the power they experience or the attention they receive? Tony Vaux brings over 20 years experience as one of Oxfam's leading emergency managers to the exploration of the conflicts between subjective impulses and objective judgements and the dilemmas relief workers contend with.",

      "title": "The Book of Beginnings",
      "abstract": "This is a book of beginnings. It consists of twelve individual stories, each of which is re-begun multiple times, and a handful of beginnings that have no ties to anything that come before them or after. A number of the threads have beginnings told at different times from different perspectives; others begin again and again from the same perspective each time. A few of the threads overlap with one another; many remain distinct. The thesis explores in the way in which stories, ideas, and concepts change as we go about writing pieces of fiction. Those ideas and concepts merge and depart so that what starts as an individual story or concept feeds in to another, or what is part of a larger story leads off into a life of its own. The thesis also plays with the way a story begins. A story can begin anywhere, so what constitutes a beginning and how does a beginning influence the way we read or the way we write? How much is a story dependent upon a beginning? How does the beginning introduce us to a story and therefore color our perception of what the story will be? If the beginning changes, how does that affect the characters or the ideas? And, can a story be told through only beginnings? Do you in fact learn things about these characters? Do you come to know them and their desires? Finally, the thesis explores yearning and what happens when yearning becomes pathological – what effect that pathology has on the mental states of those yearning and on others.",

      "abstract": "One, No One and One Hundred Thousand is a continuation of The Late Mattia Pascal in the way that it also revolves around the central theme of Pirandello’s vision—crisis of individual identity. The protagonist of the novel, Vitangello Moscarda, accidentally discovers that others have a different vision of him than the one he has created for himself. This strikes him deeply and a true obsession in him is born that uproots his life and makes him commit all kinds of nonsense. He realises that there are numerous ‘Moscardas’, each one being different, that come to life depending on the vision of numerous people around him, especially his wife. In that way, a terror arises in him defying the prison of ‘form’into which others are forcing him but he also discovers that he is a ‘nobody’ to his own self as well, which further creates a disturbing sensation of absolute solitude. By means of his own insanity he is trying to rebel against the rigid system of social conventions but is defeated.Although he strived to destroy all the imposed forms, he is now to accept and suffer through the one cast upon him by the society, i.e. that of an adulterer, although he is innocent. It is in this very defeat that he finds a way to heal from the agitation that irked him. The original state of mind that he is a ‘nobody’tormented him and fed in him a sense of grave solitude. Now, he readily accepts an alienation from his own self and irrevocably rejects any form of personal identity, even his own name, and willingly accepts the changeable flow of life to carry him, alternately dying and being born a blank slate and without reminiscence. He no longer fixates to a single form but identifies himself with all that is outside in a complete alienation from the society and the prison of form that it imposes.",

Nobly gifted, deeply afflicted and unfortunate though he was, was Tasso indeed injured, as implied, by his fellow man?

To any one coming with even a moderate knowledge of mental disease to the study of this sad life, it will surely seem one in which the tendency to, and at length declaration of, this malady can be most clearly traced out from the very early days of Tasso down to the very last hour of his life. This is not to disturb the shade of Tasso, rather to yield it the desired rest; for who would not rather think of him as bowed beneath the weight of a sad inscrutable affliction sent by no mortal hand, than as the victim of cruelty and injustice, which would indeed have been scarcely human in their refinement, but of which we must consider Alfonso d'Este may have been most unjustly accused?",

      "title": "The Big Question",
      "abstract": "Photo: Andreas FusserWith the world gripped by fear of the unknown—the next tragedy, the next crisis, the next terrorist attack, financial or societal meltdown—we thought it would be illuminating to ask our panel of global experts, who weigh in from four continents, what their fear is for the future of their nations, their respective corners of our planet.France is afraid of decline, and the specter of our own demise has brought about countless predictions of the country’s suicide. A sense of the looming twilight of a once great nation lingers in our hearts and minds. It discourages individual projects and collective ambitions, and fosters distrust and anger.We look to the future with angst and see ourselves turning into a zero-sum society, where one man’s loss is another’s gain. In this nation of reduced opportunities, we worry that our future may not be one of enlightened self-interest helping us build more together, but rather one where defiance governs the sharing of an ever-shrinking pie. We distrust the Other—be it the insider who gamed the system; the political opponent who won’t compromise, for fear of being cheated; or the immigrant, as though his finding a job could only mean “one of us” losing it to him. We suspect the super-rich whose wealth must have been stolen, and the poor, bound to be leeching benefits off hard-working people.The French populace is afraid of itself, of its collective inability to form a mutually beneficial social compact. We have known such troubled times before, when the French Revolution redefined our belonging to a common body politic. As Tocqueville, reflecting on these events, encouraged us at the very end of his Democracy in America, “let us, then look forward to the future with that salutary fear which makes men keep watch and ward for freedom, not with that faint and idle terror which depresses and enervates the heart.”Despite rising optimism for the economic future of Egypt, there remain some important warning signs for policymakers, particularly the youth bulge. In 2012, 25 percent of Egypt’s population was aged 18 to 29. Half live in poverty, with unemployment reaching 25 percent. They represent an enormous unused and untapped potential. Most youths enter the market unprepared for the skills required in a constantly changing labor market. They end up in unproductive jobs that fail to meet their aspirations for better living standards.Egypt won’t be able to grow and develop without this untapped potential, which is unemployed, underemployed, or leaving the country in search of a better life. If the basic education system is not reformed by 2018, one million young Egyptians will have entered the labor market without basic skills for productive jobs. Policymakers must devise a clear and strong education policy—focusing on quality education. Enhancing students’ creative and analytical skills is essential for them to enter the labor market productively. A quality education will not only strengthen the Egyptian education system, but will also help the labor market absorb youths who will turn out to be skilled and prepared to work.Bangladesh is one of the world’s most densely populated countries. Situated in a low-lying delta, it is vulnerable to flooding and cyclones, and each year suffers significant human and infrastructure losses from natural disasters. The South Asian nation is at the forefront of the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures associated with global warming are melting glaciers and ice caps, and the extra water is raising sea levels. Fifteen percent of the Southern coastline of Bangladesh will be underwater if the sea level rises just 18 inches by 2050.Though most think Bangladesh’s main problem is poverty, I would argue it is population. It’s remarkable the country’s economy is growing 6 percent per year since 1996, given its perpetual challenge to feed its 166 million people. But the country has an uncertain future, with 25 million Bangladeshis facing loss of their homes and farms as sea levels rise. This is more than the entire population of Australia whose landmass is more than 50 times Bangladesh’s. Bangladesh simply cannot accommodate all its people on a shrinking landmass. Centuries ago people would migrate from one continent to another in search of a better life. From 1815 to 1932, some 60 million left Europe for other continents. Today, visas and economic deterrents prevent climate refugees from moving freely to another country they can call home. Where will these 25 million climate refugees go?Kazakhstan’s biggest fear is the next devaluation. Our country, like many others, is facing a crisis that will continue for many years. Kazakhstan has experienced three devaluations. The first was in 1999, the second in 2009, and the last was in February 2014. People expect the next in 2015. There is a general decline in the growth rate and household incomes within Kazakhstan, and increased tensions abroad, particularly the military-political conflict in Ukraine.In 2014, political conflicts and mutual sanctions between Russia and the West, led by the United States, resulted in a decline of Russia’s economic growth, and destabilization of the macroeconomic environment. All this will negatively affect Russia —a leading trading and political partner of Kazakhstan. Today, the crisis is reflected in a sharp drop in oil prices—below $50 a barrel—and low prices of non-ferrous and ferrous metals and other commodities.Kazakhstan is a developing, open, but small economy, which supplies raw materials to the world market, and thus depends largely on the global market situation. However, the collapse of oil prices, devaluation of the Russian ruble, falling export prices, and the overall geopolitical and economic crisis have had a negative impact on the trade balance and economy of Kazakhstan. In these circumstances, the expectation of devaluation and deterioration of the socio-economic development of the country are legitimate and immediate fears.Italians are getting old. In 2000, people in their thirties represented the largest demographic group, but in 2050, the record will go to Italians in their seventies. Aging Italians should thus fear for the future stability of their generous public pension system. The financial and organizational challenges faced by their public and comprehensive health care system, and any change in immigration policies, may undermine long term care. Elderly Italians are largely cared for at home, with substantial help from female immigrants known as badanti (caretakers).Still, the future of elderly Italians may seem rosy compared to the present and future of the younger generation. Economic growth has been stagnating since 2000, and Italy has yet to exit the worldwide economic crisis. While elderly workers are protected against the risk of dismissal, youth unemployment has skyrocketed. A brain drain—emigration of highly educated younger Italians—is also surging. In a very family-based society like Italy, elderly parents will have more to fear about the future of their children and grandchildren than about themselves.Asians, including Koreans, have traditionally equated “calamities” with “natural disasters” that bring psychological and economic damage. In fact, empirical evidence tells us that the Asia-Pacific region in the last century accounted for 91 percent of the world’s total deaths and 49 percent of the world’s total damage due to natural disasters.The sinking of the ferry, Sewol, last year aroused unprecedented fear among Koreans of man-made calamities. That tragic accident could have been prevented, and a better response would most certainly have saved many more lives. So Koreans have come to believe that existing laws, institutions, and social infrastructure cannot guarantee their personal safety. Korea has attained the kind of economic growth that no other country has been able to achieve in modern history, and the economic overdrive often overshadows the importance of safety. Now, we are paying a social price. The government’s response system is not on a par with Koreans’ increased awareness about personal safety. That naturally resulted in a loss of faith in the government, creating social fissures. Koreans’ hysterical, groundless fear of mad cow disease in 2008, for example, engendered a serious conflict.Indeed, the Korean people harbor a wide range of fears, including neighboring North Korea’s nuclear program, the ongoing economic recession, and natural disasters resulting from climate change. The fear that the state and government may not be able to ensure personal security and safety in times of crisis could continue to grow.Russia’s growing military involvement in the region is the biggest threat to Moldova. While the nation’s ruling pro-European politicians try to move Moldova closer to the European Union, Russian policymakers perceive the rapprochement as a threat to their foreign policy goals. Since Russia is not willing to let Moldova join the European Union or NATO, it spends a significant amount of resources and effort to block Moldova’s European aspirations. It actively supports anti-EU political players, who have on their agenda integration with the Eurasian Union.A political and economic organization modeled after the EU, the Eurasian Union is Russia’s attempt to recreate the Soviet Union. In Moldova, this tug-of-war between a pro-European right-wing and a pro-Russian left polarizes the Moldovan political establishment and population. In this context, the hybrid warfare initiated by Russia in neighboring Ukraine only inflates the threat perceptions of many Moldovan politicians. They see the unfolding of some form of hybrid warfare in their own country as a plausible scenario. The potential unfreezing of the Transnistrian conflict coupled with intense Gagauz activism in the southern part of Moldova provide Russia with opportunities to push the nation to the brink of a violent civil conflict. Such an attempt was already thwarted in November 2014 before the parliamentary elections, so it is not surprising that Moldovan policymakers closely follow the events in Ukraine for lessons about their own future.Israel was founded in 1948, touching off a war against its Arab neighbors. The war ended in statehood for the Jews and catastrophe for the Palestinians, who became either refugees or a powerless minority within Israel. Since then, several major wars were fought against different collections of Arab states, usually with overwhelming Israeli victories. More elusive were the outcomes of military operations against nationalists and, since the 1980s, radical Islamic organizations in the Occupied Territories or beyond the nation’s borders. In between, there were also several rounds of negotiations, most notably peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and the Oslo accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Yet, neither arms nor negotiations have brought any relief. The security problem looms large, and peace eludes Israel more than ever.Thus, Israel, or more accurately its Jewish society, is afraid for its existence. The threat today is felt to reside less in the Arab states, and more in the rising force of Islamic radicalism, whether of the Iranian statist type and its nuclear program, or the fanatical brutal type of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Jewish society is even more afraid of the Arab-Muslim Israeli citizens who live in its midst, imagining them as a potential fifth column. Here, like in Europe, lies the roots of the growing attraction of the Israeli right-wing since the collapse of Oslo, and the exceptionally long incumbency of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, whose policy echoes and cultivates these fears.Over the past four years, Brazil’s economy grew at an average yearly rate of 1.5 percent—the worst performance among the major emerging economies. It is tempting to attribute these results to the slow growth of the global economy. But Brazil’s performance lags behind the corresponding performance of its neighbors in Latin America, the emerging Asian countries, and three fellow BRICS—China, India, and Russia. The administration believed this paralysis of growth rested on insufficient domestic demand. Accordingly, the economic policy took a Keynesian route to stimulate the economy—expanding public expenditures and financing the private sector by state banks at below-market interest rates. After four years of this policy, the result was a deteriorating balance of payments and increasing inflationary pressures.A new economic team now has the task of reversing this situation. A more orthodox policy includes reduction of subsidies, cuts in current expenditures, and rising taxes—to produce a minimum primary budget surplus required to stabilize the growth of public debt. President Dilma Rousseff correctly opted for a conservative economic policy in her second term. In so doing, she faces a big challenge—persist with the orthodox policy mix until positive results appear and protect the economic team from expected pressures from vested interests that were thriving under the previous system.After the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, Germany has revived its conversation on data retention, while beginning a new and expanded discussion of access to encrypted communication for state authorities. Since the uproar about mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and other services has ebbed, this renewed discussion of further surveillance measures no longer causes any substantial outrage. At most, there is a desperate head-shaking going through some Twitter hashtags. Certainly, there are activists and journalists who try to keep the issue on the agenda, but it no longer attracts widespread discussion. The fact that total surveillance will lead to an erosion of our basic rights seems to be forgotten. The right to privacy is virtually non-existent. If we choose to fight for our privacy, we need to implement uncomfortable solutions that require efforts many people are not willing to undertake.A study published by PEN International shows that the behavior of journalists and other media workers has changed dramatically. Even in countries believed to be free, where free speech is a core principle, media workers self-censor their communications. Total surveillance of communications in Germany undermines the rights to privacy, perhaps society itself. But one of the biggest threats to Germany is that total surveillance as a discussion is sliding into obscurity, or simply ignored.Armenia is ranked as a middle-income country, but the weakened economic performance in recent years places the country at risk of finding itself in the pool of low-income countries. Growing inequalities and poverty polarize society. The poor are increasingly isolated from the rich, and the two segments behave as distinct societies with little interaction. The same goods, services, or art products are created and sold for the poor and rich in different spaces and at different prices.Armenia is finding it difficult to sustain national security. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan, and a rather hostile relationship with Turkey going back to the early 20th century make the security issue of paramount importance. Armenian society needs to be unified to pursue a favorable resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and grow prosperity in Armenia. Increasing social disruption has left different social segments with little to share. The big question for the Armenian elite is how to reverse the processes of disruption in the society.The Euromaidan revolution and regime change, the economic and financial meltdown, two elections, the Russian annexation of Crimea, the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, and Russia’s intransigence returned the world to the Cold War and forced Ukrainians to wonder whether their nation would survive as an independent state.Implementing reforms and fighting corruption have been long overdue, and even in a different environment, pro-Western leaders would only have accomplished some of these goals. Even with the election of a pro-European president and parliament, Ukraine’s complete reliance on international assistance to prevent its default and ongoing conflict with Russia make structural reforms more difficult. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s foreign policy goals of NATO and EU membership are opposed by Russia and hardly welcomed by Western European member states.Ukraine’s biggest fear is Russia’s desire to destroy it as an independent state, using nearly all means at its disposal. Russia’s determination to bend Ukraine to its will overrides the sanctions that damage its economy and finances, brings untold civilian suffering, high numbers of military casualties, war crimes, and destruction of property. Russia’s new imperialism rejects the very existence of Ukraine as a separate nation, in a similar throwback to Germany’s relationship toward Austria the 1930s. Ukraine is the first country to experience the deadly nature of the Putin Doctrine, but it surely will not be the last.Estonia, a small and liberal country, is petrified of being lost between West and East, between liberal small and big countries of Europe and its illiberal giant neighbor, Russia. European states are going to be overwhelmingly occupied with terrorism, and each country’s economic problems will have to be solved. Estonia’s Western partners are far from Russia and are self-centered—their own domestic problems coming first.In this situation, an aggressive eastern neighbor with authoritarian leadership can easily overlay military activities in some modern form with a new pretext, as happened in Crimea in 2014. Estonia, in this situation, will be left suspended between the larger countries of the West and Russia. Besides being a member of the EU, Estonia is also a NATO member country. NATO is often assumed to be a security guarantor and a defense against military action by any other state. However, beyond the fifth article of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, the fourth one also means that the members must first consult before taking action. Thus, Estonia’s biggest fear is to be disregarded by the West in its relations with the East.Whether it is seismic, political, religious, ethnic, or regional, Turkey’s greatest fear concerns the activation of fault lines, and subsequent domestic and regional instability. On the domestic scene, a devastating earthquake could destroy Istanbul, Turkey’s bustling commercial center. The polarization between secularists and religious conservatives may lead to significant domestic strife, accentuated by the challenges of reconciling the country’s myriad identities. A potential failure of the current peace process with the Kurdish minority, along with intensifying regional conflicts, may once again spark ethnic separatism.Regionally, major challenges include deepening sectarian lines, the instability caused by the Syrian conflict, the refugee crisis, and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Moreover, Ankara must preserve a precarious balance between its Western allies and an increasingly assertive Russia, on which Turkey depends for energy. Despite a seemingly positive turn, the outcome of nuclear negotiations with Iran remains unclear. Globally, the intensifying threat from religious extremist terrorist networks, on the one hand, and Islamophobia and extreme nationalism, on the other, indicate a deepening, potentially explosive rift.So Turkey contends with multiple domestic, regional, and global fault lines, as well as the serious danger that one break will trigger another. Turkey’s location between Europe and Asia, its proximity to the Caucasus, the Balkans, and Africa, bestows significant opportunities. Some 1.5 billion people from 39 countries can reach Istanbul with a four-hour flight. But with opportunities come serious risks. As a crucial power in this turbulent region, Turkey plays a critical role for peace and stability. However, Turkey can be more constructive and avoid being engulfed by multiple fault lines, if it masters three challenges—consolidating its democracy, maintaining good neighborly relations, and operating within a predominantly European framework while simultaneously pursuing a multilateral foreign policy with extensive Eurasian ties.Namibia’s biggest problem is arguably unemployment. Since independence from South Africa in 1990, unemployment has risen at an alarming rate to a current level of 34 percent to 49 percent. Two fundamental problems arise from such high-level unemployment. The first relates to migration patterns as a result of unemployment. We are witnessing a steady increase in rural-urban migration, placing significant pressure on urban authorities, but this has also led to a significant increase in the price of urban land.The second issue relates to youth unemployment, which in parallel with overall jobless rates has risen from 38 percent in 2012 to 42 percent in 2013. This continued increase in youth unemployment has led to a rise in alcoholism and an increase in HIV prevalence. Recently, and partly in response to the demand for land, young people embarked on a campaign called “affirmative repositioning.” This campaign, if left unaddressed, has the potential to pose a huge challenge to the Namibian government.",

      "abstract": "burnout: burnoutFigureFigureLao Tzu once said, “If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present.” The simple concept of being present is an overwhelmingly common theme among self-help books. The barrier to being present for many of us is either that we are consumed by the stories of our past or by anxiety about what lies ahead in our future. Reflection is an essential skill for emergency physicians. We must strive more specifically for reflection-in-action, which is our ability to pause during moments when critical, high-stakes decisions must be made. Being present and aware of our thinking in real time prevents cognitive errors. Similarly, metacognition, or thinking about our thinking, is essential for maintaining our well-being and for being mentally and emotionally prepared for each shift. Emergency medicine is a field with inherent challenges to being present during a shift and in our lives outside of the ED. Our work is stressful, with many decisions made per shift and per patient. We often go home with our minds racing, still in overdrive, pondering our thought processes or concerned about a patient we just treated. Shift work, which requires fighting against our natural circadian rhythm, does not make this easier. We easily fall into the trap of dwelling on the past or being anxious about the future. Even one bad case can affect our relationships at home, our self-worth, and our ability to do our jobs well when we return for our next shift. None of us is immune to burnout as a result of a bad case or the stressors in our work environment. As a specialty, we must acknowledge the high levels of burnout (more than 65% burnout rate among emergency physicians) and depression in emergency medicine, and work to build systems to reduce both. (Ann Emerg Med 2013;61[3]:A17.) As individuals, we can prepare ourselves by understanding and practicing habits that help us become more present, so that we have coping strategies when we need them. Many of the approaches to dealing with burnout and depression focus on strategies that force us to be present. Here are a few tips that we can all use in our lives to achieve this goal. Foster an Attitude of Gratitude: Be grateful for everything you have, and remind yourself of those things at least once a day. Make a Happy List: Do you know what makes you happy? Going for a run or taking a long walk? Doing the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle? It's important to take a few moments to list the things you like to do and try your best to do some of them every day. Meditate/Do Yoga: Many studies have shown the benefits of yoga and meditation, such as ensuring that you are living in the present, calming your mind, decreasing stress and anxiety, and promoting overall health. Spending time reflecting in nature or while exercising is equally effective. Unplug your Phone: Technology helps us, but it's important to limit the time we spend on our devices. There is no need to check social media a hundred times a day, nor is there a benefit to checking your email every two minutes. If you can cut back, you can enjoy the present and be more fulfilled. Be Kind: Multiple studies have found that being compassionate and engaged, smiling, giving sincere compliments, volunteering your time, and giving to charity make you feel present and increase your overall health, happiness, and well-being. Write in a Journal: The best way to ensure that you are constantly aware of the present is to know that later that night you'll be writing about it. This makes you take in the details of your surroundings and pay closer attention to the people with whom you interact. It makes you more cognizant of the decisions you make during the day, how you spend your time, and what you choose to think about. Try New Things: Variety is truly the spice of life. As hectic, chaotic, unpredictable, and random our work lives may be, we need to be stimulated to try different things in our private life. Try new foods, travel somewhere off the beaten path, take a class, learn a new language, or connect with someone you haven't heard from in a while. Small acts like these connect you with the present by making the present unique, memorable, and distinct from other moments. If you have any other strategies that work for you, please send them to us. To prevent burnout, we must strive to work together and help each other improve the quality of our lives—for our own mental health and for the welfare of our patients.

      "title": "Psychology of Forgiveness Impl ications for Psychotherapy",
      "abstract": "We live in a world fraught with hostility and alienation at both interpersonal and societal levels. The media barrage us with reports of ethnic wars growing out of centuries of hatred and distrust, political terrorism, random violence in the streets, domestic violence, child abuse of various sorts-the list seems endless. Clearly, there is a tremendous amount of hurt in our lives-both personal and cultural. What is the impact of injury on our lives? How can we heal from it? These were questions we and our fellow researchers had over a decade ago when we embarked on the study of forgiveness. Partly because of the complexity of the phenomenon, we decided to focus on forgiveness in everyday life as opposed to more dramatic social or political contexts. Even so, forgiveness turned out to be a challenging topic to research. For example, while people were willing to share their experience of forgiveness on deep and personal levels, their doing so often involved a great deal of emotional pain. On another level, conducting this research was not only a difficult but also a ground­ breaking enterprise, because in Western culture forgiveness is a word with religious con­ notations, and many people are uncomfortable with it as a topic of dialogue. Moreover, forgiveness is spoken of more often as an abstract ideal than as central to one's experience. We have come to wonder whether this confusion concerning the experience of forgiveness may not be an expression of specific contemporary cultural values that run counter to the attitudes necessary for forgiveness: openness to oneself and others, to the metaphorical or mysterious in living, and to mercy. Instead, justice has become synonymous with punish­ ment, mercy with weakness, strength with power over others. Given this situation, it is no",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT When do the many become one? Why does one join with others? In his political writings of self-government, Rousseau proposes “when the obstacles to their self-preservation in the state of nature are too great to be overcome by the forces each individual is capable of exerting to maintain himself in that state.” Few obstacles are more threatening to an individual than disease and death, and our response as a civilization is the institution of healthcare. The impetus for this perspective piece budded from personal experience and a resultant sentiment that emerged from more deliberate contemplation. It is purposed to conjure in the reader a certain joy of that which can be accomplished through collaboration, but concomitantly, to offer perspective as to characteristics opined to be vital to creating and maintaining a great team.",

The characters in these stories are utterly human; they are pushed, pulled, and often fall victim to circumstance. A woman grapples between her love of roadside attractions and her boyfriend's grief. A son is forced to decide whether or not to honor his mother's final wishes. A college student is blind to her brother's evolution beyond their family. A woman discovers new possibilities while stalking graveyards to escape the memory of a man who left her behind. A teenager on the run finds' and loses' her first love. As desperately as they struggle to control their situations, their love lives, their families, and their emotions, they are often faced with simply having to come to terms with their realities. These eleven stories are intended to examine the ways people are capable of treating each other, both good and bad, and how people deal with the inevitably of being forced to move beyond what seems permanent, to create new identities, to laugh, and to learn from their mistakes.",

I tell people that I am an artist, a nice thing to label myself because it implies a lifestyle of indeterminate work hours and an indeterminate income. In short, no one can tell just by looking how successful or unsuccessful an artist is. And because artists are stereotyped as being a bit odd or fey, the eccentricities of a schizophrenic personality are attributed to a creative, rather than diseased, mind. If a stranger is kindhearted, then they imagine the best and are comfortable in conversation, treating me as an equal. Needling questions about my lifestyle are usually passed by for more exciting topics—the immediate favorite is always “What do you paint?” Few try to ascertain my productivity or scale of talent. Because of my illness, I can only make 4 or 5 paintings a year. And because of my reclusive nature, promoting myself socially is a difficult and almost abhorrent task. I do make a little money as an artist. But most of the money needed to buy paint, brushes, canvass, and frames is donated by family members.",

      "abstract": "Without being properly exiled, forced for political, ideological or religious reasons to leave their “matrie”, the protagonists (parents and children) of the novels from Maghrebian immigration all live a painful, sometimes exhausting, exile experience. Far from their home country or the land of their origin, they generally relate to it in two ways. On the one hand, there are those who remain strongly attached to their homeland or who carry it in their hearts as unalterable inheritance transmitted by their parents; they dream of the great return, which they succeed in accomplishing (sometimes only after their death) or not; they so venerate this distant land that they end up becoming unaware of the passing of time and the transformations (even alterations) that all that has remained there (objects, people) suffered. On the other hand, there are those who, for different reasons, want to erase their memories, who are striving (at all costs) to detach themselves from a stormy past, a hostile country (even enemy) to which nothing connects them except contempt, fear or disgust. To illustrate these two possible resolutions in the face of “exilience” - bledophilia and “bledophobia” - we rely on the novels Méchamment berbère by Minna Sif (1997), Mohand, le harki by Hadjila Kemoum (2003), Kiffe kiffe demain by Faïza Guène (2004), Pieds-Blancs by Houda Rouane (2006) and Un homme, ça ne pleure pas by Faïza Guène (2014).",

      "abstract": "The identity of an animated character means who he really is, or what are the characteristics that would never change? How the character sees himself and how others see him? It includes shape, color, race, beliefs, and choices in life.The more the storyteller gives identity to his animated character, the more it is sound and convincing. In that sense, it touches the audiences’ hearts as they feel its pain or happiness. In other words, they are involved in the story and united with the character.As the story begins, characters and settings are presented before the audience to get an overview of the characters’ identity. Then, more elements are to show up, like the conflict, the problem that needs to be solved and the rising actions, which are series of events that lead to the high main point or the climax. It is considered as a turning point of the story after which the falling actions come. The falling actions are events and complications that start to loosen the plot. Gradually, the solution shows up as the story ends either happily or tragically.Throughout the story line, these groups of events that form the story sometimes account for the appearance of an identity crisis that impact the character. It means that he is uncertain of his feelings about himself; he gets confused about what type of person he is or what is the true purpose of his life. It always takes making an existential that plays a big role in the story line.The identity crisis appear in Toy Story 1995 to Buzz light-year when he discovers the truth of himself; that he is a toy, not a space ranger as he thought before. This made him give up hope of returning anywhere. It took him sometime to accept the fact of himself after seeing how Woody struggles to return them both to Andy. He tries his best to save his friend and return home safely, as being dictated by the role’s vision.In Toy Story 2 1999, the identity crisis appear to Woody when Buzz strikes him with the fact that he is not a collector’s item. He is a child’s play thing, he is a toy. Then, a decision has to be made to return to Andy, and the struggles start with the Prospector.In Toy Story 3, 2010, the identity crisis appear to Woody at the end of the story. He was suffering to be away from all his toy family that will be left in the attic, so he wrote on the box to be donated and he attached himself in, with them hoping that Andy gives him a very warm goodbye and leaves him with the rest of the toys in good hands.In Finding Nemo 2003, the identity crisis for Nemo is when he chooses to touch the boat, even though it is a dangerous thing, just to prove to his father and his friends that he is brave. It led him to fall in the capture and to meet other fish.",

      "abstract": "kindness, caring: kindness, caringIt was a busy night (as usual) in the emergency department. I was in the final hours of my shift when I knocked on the door to see my next patient. She was a young woman in her 30s on opiates to treat chronic pain. She presented with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and constipation. Depending on your perspective, this chief complaint can conjure up different thoughts and emotions about this patient's presentation. We may prejudge this patient based on our past experiences: “Chronic pain, really, in a 30-year-old? Possible fecal disimpaction at the end of my shift? Drug seeking?” It can be so easy to get sucked into a vortex of preconceptions about a person we have never met before, and these presumptions can affect our attitudes, words, body language, and even the energy we project. Admittedly, many times our assumptions will be correct. But not always. So what do we do? How should we address this person? Is she truly suffering, or does she have ulterior motives that have compelled her to feign illness? Sometimes it is obvious, but other times it is difficult to differentiate between the two. How should we treat this patient? I believe the answer to this question may be found in the reason that we decided to become health care providers in the first place. Do you remember back when you filled out your medical/PA/nursing school application? What was the principal reason you wanted to get into the medical field? For all of us (hopefully), it was because we wanted to help people. We wanted to do something good in the service of others. I believe that the absolute most effective way to accomplish this is through kindness. Of course, having a solid and ever-growing fund of medical knowledge as well as excellent technical skills are mandatory. Kindness, however, is the icing on the cake. The doctor-patient relationship, the interaction between two human beings, is such an important aspect of healing. Being kind to others creates a bond of warmth and openness that will reassure them. It can help our patients better comprehend and accept the treatments we offer. Our kindness will make it more likely that our patients will ask questions to clarify things that they do not understand. Our compassion will help our patients feel a bit better. I work in a busy ED, and I understand all too well the time constraints that are imposed upon us. We need to see our patients quickly so that we can move on to the next thing. Thinking about it, being kind doesn't take much more time than being curt. We can be kind even when we are in a hurry (which is most of the time). In a few extra seconds, we can provide a smile, an expression of caring, or a gentle touch on our patient's shoulder. Sometimes we can choose to take an extra moment that we don't have to be sincere and give a little more of ourselves to the person lying on the stretcher in front of us. Isn't this the reason we come to work every day? Occasionally, we are given the luxury of a few extra minutes. This can be a wonderful healing experience for the patient and the provider. Not only does our patient feel that we care, but our genuine kindness has emotional benefits for us as well. Even during encounters with those individuals who we know have hidden motives, we can still be kind. We should always exercise sound medical judgment, but that does not necessarily preclude acting in a compassionate manner. Returning to my patient, I entered the room and saw the young lady standing hunched over the bedside table. I did not know what her motives were. I chose to act the way I normally would, in a considerate manner. I introduced myself, and she told me what was bothering her. I thought that her chronic opiate use was likely a contributing factor. Following this line of thought, I began to ask more questions. I formulated a plan, and she agreed. A few minutes later, she came up to the nurse's station and wanted to leave AMA. I went back into the room with her to understand why she had a change of heart. Apparently, she had been seen for this same recurring problem a few times, and all her treating providers had questioned her opiate use. She felt that I was blaming her. It was busy, and I still had many things to wrap up, but I sat down and explained that my motivation for inquiring about the opiates was driven by a desire to figure out how to best address her problem. She understood and agreed to stay. I could have just as easily let her leave AMA, but that would not have been the right thing to do. I genuinely cared about her, and wanted to do what was in my power to help her. We ended up speaking for a short time, and I learned a bit about her. She was a pleasant young lady who had unfortunately been experiencing some tough times. She appreciated the fact that I listened to her. I felt content, knowing that I was able to improve her life in a small way. Oh, and she declined any offer of pain medicine. There is an abundance of diagnostic and therapeutic tests, procedures, and pharmaceuticals in modern medicine that have helped heal countless people. These are the tangibles. But we must never forget the equally important intangibles — the kindness, empathy, caring, and sincerity that play such a vital role in healing the body, mind, and spirit.",

      "title": "A History of &amp;quot;Ludicrous&amp;quot;",
      "abstract": "A History of \"Ludicrous\" Matthew Kaiser I. What \"Ludicrous\" Means lu*di*crous (l—oo´di kres), adj. causing laughter because of absurdity; provoking or deserving derision; ridiculous; laughable: a ludicrous lack of efficiency. —Webster's Unabridged Dictionary The English word \"ludicrous\" is synonymous with \"ridiculous,\" \"absurd,\" and \"laughable.\" \"Be ludicrous!\" is invariably preceded by \"don't.\" To have the misfortune of being perceived as ludicrous, or to utter a statement deemed ludicrous, means that one's words or actions have inadvertently aroused in one's audience either contemptuous, skeptical, or condescending laughter. Although sometimes audible, more often than not this laughter takes the form of a sensation of superiority and elevation, delight in witnessing the sweeping vista of another's vulnerability, his or her paucity of insight, skill, or common sense. We do not call statements or actions which knowingly solicit laughter \"ludicrous\": instead, we categorize them as either witty, clever, funny, or ironic. On the other hand, statements or actions which solicit laughter in contexts not conducive to laughter—tableaux of funeral and deathbed come to mind—are painfully ludicrous. Likewise, we perceive failed or artless attempts at soliciting laughter as ludicrous. Although we might smirk or chuckle in these scenarios, we do so at the expense of the speaker or actor: laughter, in this case, functions as rebuke, derision rather than acceptance of a tactless or ineffective invitation to laugh. To accuse another of being ludicrous, then, means to question not so much that individual's truthfulness or integrity, although this might be a secondary or indirect motive, but rather his or her capacity to perceive and to assess with requisite competence a given set of facts. This incompetence is either constitutional, that is, caused by lack of acuity or subtlety, a perceptual defect, or, more likely, it is circumstantial, [End Page 631] the result of ignorance, lack of access to a given set of facts, a body of knowledge. \"Ludicrous\" is wielded by those in the know, by those who wish to appear in the know. The frequency with which \"ludicrous\" is used in the media has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Contrary to the predictions of information-age enthusiasts, the proliferation of twenty-four-hour news networks, the advent of the Internet, and the metastasis of talk radio have only superficially democratized and decentralized the dissemination of information. Nevertheless, for individuals in search of the word \"ludicrous,\" the information-communication industry's perpetual chatter, the dueling pundits and political gossips, constitutes a veritable El Dorado. Indeed, in the endless procession of prefabricated debates—about politics and law, culture and sex—that fill American airwaves and newspapers, \"ludicrous\" makes a regular appearance, proving one of the more popular rhetorical devices with which partisans discredit the opinions and philosophies of their opponents. Political commentator Spencer Ackerman, for instance, dismisses as \"ludicrous\" former House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt's prediction that Democrats would \"pick up 30 to 40 seats\" in the 2002 midterm elections.1 One hears former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich complain: \"The concept of the American secretary of state going to Damascus to meet with a terrorist-supporting, secret-police-wielding dictator is ludicrous.\"2 About Democrat Bill McBride's failed effort to unseat Florida governor Jeb Bush, CNN pundit Tucker Carlson concludes: \"It was a ludicrous campaign to begin with.\"3 In an attempt to deflate the heroic image of former NATO supreme commander General Wesley Clark, who, in the summer of 2003, was pondering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination, conservative columnist George Will preemptively snapped: \"Comparisons of Clark to Dwight Eisenhower are ludicrous.\"4 The political right, of course, does not own the word. In August 2002, in a New York Times op-ed enumerating the Republican party's history of anti-internationalism, Democratic strategist Ted Widmer proclaims: \"[Senator Joseph] McCarthy's accusations [against Democratic policymakers] were ludicrous.\"5 Skeptical about reports that Americans desire war with Iraq, Arianna Huffington ponders \"the ludicrousness of basing our national security policy on the shoot-from-the-lip responses of a person who has been interrupted in the middle of dinner . . . by a pollster.\"6 New York Times columnist Paul Krugman...",

      "title": "Opening Remarks at the Dahrendorf Symposium 2016",
      "abstract": "It is not just in the West that we are seeing this rejection of rights and liberalism. There is the emergence of strongmen, an odd term because it often is a product of weakness that people like Erdoğan in Turkey, Putin in Russia, al-Sisi in Egypt, or even going a bit further afield Xi Jinping in China resort to these authoritarian methods. These are extraordinarily challenging times. We are seeing the rise of the far right in the West, with leaders such as Orbán or Kaczyński in Hungary and in Poland, a narrow miss in Austria, politicians like Trump or Marine Le Pen, who easily could win in their respective countries. This phenomenon is very much bred by different types of insecurity. Economic insecurity, with much of the working class left with the feeling that they are being left behind, that their lives are not improving or indeed are getting worse economically; physical insecurity, with people fearing that going out with friends to a restaurant or attending a concert could lead to them being shot; and cultural insecurity, where people trying to respond to the big cultural shifts represented by large-scale migration, perhaps mythically think back to a moment when our nation states were more ethnically homogeneous. But it is not just in the West that we are seeing this rejection of rights and liberalism. There is the emergence of strongmen, an odd term because it often is a product of weakness that leads people like Erdoğan in Turkey, Putin in Russia, al-Sisi in Egypt, or even going a bit further afield Xi Jinping in China to resort to these authoritarian methods. We are seeing a disregard for rights standards even in the way that wars are fought these days, epitomised by Assad's decision to fight in Syria not simply by targeting combatants in the way laid down under the Geneva Conventions, but rather by deliberately targeting civilians who happen to live in opposition-held areas. We see the emergence of groups like Daesh (IS) that are openly, proudly flouting the most basic standards of Western democracy, of Western rights, of liberalism. Now bad as this sounds, I think it is important to stress that these trends, though real, are not inevitable. And their success, if you want to use that term, depends very much on our response to them. They thrive when the response is weak, when there is little resistance. And sadly, that has represented much of the Western response to these trends. We see this in the new European Union states with the virtually non-response to Orbán's openly articulated illiberal democracy. There has been a slightly greater response with respect to the developments in Poland. The rule of law mechanism has been invoked. But a poor precedent was set with Hungary of little if any response. You contrast this, for example, with the active ostracisation that Haider encountered at the turn of the century when he joined the Austrian government. You see a similarly weak response in what might be referred to as the heart of Europe. There is, frankly, a tendency on the part of mainstream political parties to mimic rather than to oppose much of the agenda of the far right. I was just in France earlier this week, where the supposedly temporary emergency in response to the terrorist attacks in November has now been extended for the third time, even though the government has yet to make any showing of why the police cannot just go to a judge for an order before they knock down somebody's door or impose control orders on a person. You see this in the new infatuation with American style mass surveillance, even though with every terrorist incident we hear over and over again how the suspects were known to the police, but the police do not have the capacity to follow up. Yet the police want this avalanche of additional data thrown at them from mass surveillance. We see in the response to the migrant and refugee crisis, with rising xenophobia, rising Islamophobia, far few people playing the leadership role that we have seen here in Angela Merkel or, for example, Justin Trudeau in Canada. Speaking about the refugee deal that the EU has struck with Turkey, it is a mixed bag. There are good elements to it because, frankly, one solution to the refugee problem that would be consistent with the rights of asylum seekers would be to invest big time in the country as a first refuge. This could be Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, with investments that make it possible for refugees to envision a life there, to see their kids going to school, to have a job, to build a house, to get medical care. And so the proposed spending of 6 billion euro in Turkey is good. It is a way of helping to meet these needs of refugees. There is an urgent need for something comparable in Lebanon, where 25 per cent of the population is Syrian refugees. Where the refugee deal goes completely wrong is in its lip service paid to the right of people who reach Greece, and therefore the European Union, to seek asylum in the European Union. The deal was premised on the doctrine that, if you pass through a safe third country on the way, you should have applied for asylum there. And then the fiction is put forth that Turkey is a safe place to forcibly return asylum seekers. A Greek appellate tribunal has put the kibosh on this idea. But I suspect it is going to return to the agenda. It is a fiction because Turkey has ratified the Refugee Convention in a very idiosyncratic way so that it applies only to Europeans. It does not apply to the people who are actually the refugees, the Syrians, the Iraqis, the Afghans. All of them are there simply as a matter of Erdoğan's discretion. Now he has exercised his discretion generously for the most part with Syrians. Except that same discretionary approach, that same disregard for international law as a binding obligation, is why today there are 100,000 Syrians on the Syrian side of the Turkish border being shot at by the police and, in some cases, killed when they try to cross the border. This is part of Erdoğan's effort to use the refugees as a buffer to prevent the Syrian Kurds from linking up territory they control. Because of this discretion, the Syrians inside Turkey tend to be treated reasonably generously, but the Iraqis and Afghans who together compromise roughly the same percentage as the Syrians arriving in Greece, they are being sent back to Iraq and Afghanistan. Extra discretion is not being exercised for their benefit. And without ratifying the Refugee Convention unconditionally, Erdoğan considers himself not legally prohibited from doing that. Let us look at the EU response to the broader region, where there is obviously rising illiberalism. Protests to Erdoğan's gradual decimation of the checks and balances on Turkish democracy has been muted because the EU is dependent on Erdoğan to enforce this misguided refugee deal. If we look at al-Sisi in Egypt, there is a tendency to just accept him. John Kerry cannot show up in Egypt without the words ‘transition to democracy’ coming out of his mouth, even though nobody thinks that that is what is going on. Al-Sisi has been crushing not just the Muslim Brotherhood, but any organised opposition to his rule. And there is this tendency to say, ‘Oh, well, Egypt is a bastion of stability. Let us just leave it alone’. But al-Sisi is IS's best friend because what al-Sisi has done is to preclude the possibility of political Islam by election. He basically has sent the message that, if you want political Islam, IS is your only choice because, if you want the electoral approach, I'm going to put you in prison along with 40,000 others of your fellow Muslim Brotherhood members. This is a dream for IS recruiters, yet Egypt is the main Western ally in the region right now. Or look at the EU response to the way Saudi Arabia is operating in Yemen, where with the finest precision weapons that money can buy, Saudi Arabia has been indiscriminately bombing Yemeni civilians. Sixty per cent of the civilian deaths in Yemen have been due to Saudi-led bombing, and roughly half of the casualties in that conflict have been civilian. But the US, the UK and France have been eager to sell their arms and so have not put serious pressure on Saudi Arabia to rein in its indiscriminate form of warfare. In Syria, the first mistake being made is that everybody is prioritising IS over Assad, which at a certain level is understandable. IS is a horrible entity. It represents a terrorist threat to Europe. But from a Syrian perspective, IS is small potatoes compared to the killing being done by Assad, who is probably responsible for 80 to 90 per cent of civilian deaths in Syria. That has been a secondary priority for the West. Now the deal being negotiated in Geneva is going very slowly. It is dependent on the opposition accepting an interim role for Assad, some kind of transitional period. And it is not an irrational condition in the sense that nobody is interested in the state collapsing. Nobody wants to replicate Iraq or Libya in Syria. But the opposition will never agree to a managed transition with Assad in power so long as he is targeting their family members, their friends, and their neighbours. There is a way to stop this targeting of civilians, the barrel bombs on Aleppo, this besieging of civilian neighbourhoods, the execution of prisoners and that is to use the obvious leverage of Russia. Assad maintains power today only because of Russian military backing. But John Kerry, who is leading the Syria portfolio, is unwilling to put public pressure on Russia because Russia, in his view, is a partner in peace, not an accomplice in mass murder. And there is no other European nation, including this one [Germany], that is standing up and publicly trying to link Assad's atrocities to Putin's support. That is the only way to rein Assad in. And it is not as if Putin is beyond shaming because Putin cares desperately, particularly about European public opinion, given that he wants the Ukrainian sanctions lifted. And more broadly, he wants a divided Europe because Russia would then be relatively more powerful with respect to Europe. This obviously does not leave a pretty picture. But my takeaway from all of this is that we are not powerless in the face of these trends. The rise in these various threats to rights, which I have had to rush over very quickly I realise, it exists largely because it has not been effectively or systematically countered. The field has been left open to these illiberal trends. I do not pretend it is easy to fight back. It can be politically difficult. There is an economic cost if you do not sell your arms to Saudi Arabia. There is a political cost if you stand up for the rights of asylum seekers. The demagogues on the right will profit. But these values, the values of liberalism, the values of rights and democracy that we are here to discuss today, are values that are worth defending. And if we do not, we may well wake up to a world or to societies where these values are no longer as vibrant as we assume they should be. We may find that these are the values of a historical era, of a period, rather than the foundation that we have always assumed them to be for our societies.

      "abstract": "A lo largo de los años, nuestra cultura occidental ha apartado el tema de la muerte a través de su evitación o incluso negación. Por lo tanto, creemos necesaria una intervención educativa con mayores para eliminar el tema de la muerte como un tabú, y referirnos a ella como parte de nuestra vida y que como tal ha de llegar sin tener que sufrir cuando pensamos en ella. Este artículo muestra el relato de las personas mayores acerca de las actitudes tanto positivas como negativas hacia la finitud propia y ajena, poniendo de manifiesto la importancia y la necesidad de crear diversos puntos de encuentro y reflexión educativa, por ejemplo, en el Aula Permanente de Formación Abierta. Para ello, se seleccionó un diseño metodológico cualitativo utilizando como técnicas de recogida de información la entrevista semiestructurada y en profundidad. Los resultados señalan una actitud predominantemente positiva de la muerte propia pero no tanto de la muerte ajena, relatando el miedo o la ansiedad hacia la finitud de un ser querido. Explican su desconcierto al hablar de la finitud, pero afirman tenerla muy presente debido a que se trata de un tema muy relevante a su edad. Resaltamos la importancia de crear espacios educativos para poder tratar dichas actitudes negativas y reforzar las positivas. La finalidad de una educación para muerte es que los profesionales de la educación fundamenten y reflexionen acerca de su enseñanza, el aprender y desaprender y reaprender en la auto-formación donde la muerte ocupe su lugar natural.",

      "abstract": "You have bought a bag of candy to keep yourself entertained while watching movies in the comfort of your home. Your intention is to keep the candy bag in your cabinet for several weeks, and to only treat yourself with some candy when watching movies. However, you somehow find the bag emptied while watching your first movie. And although eating the delicious candy by the handful was certainly enjoyable, you also feel guilty for finishing the entire bag at once. This is only one example of many dilemmas we encounter in everyday life. In this thesis, dilemmas are defined as experiences with three main ingredients: (1) mutually exclusive choices, (2) conflicting concerns, and (3) mixed emotions. Figure 1 shows the framework of dilemmas, which illustrates these ingredients related to the conflict between enjoying candy while watching a movie versus eating moderately to maintain good health (see Chapter 5). The articulation of these three ingredients enables us to provide a more elaborate definition of dilemmas: People experience a dilemma when they are faced with two mutually exclusive choices, both of which touch upon their personal concerns, and the simultaneous fulfillment of both choices is challenging, if not impossible, to obtain or achieve. Because of this challenge, people experience both positive and negative emotions toward each alternative.",

      "abstract": "This article responds to the two replies, published in this issue, to my article “Ultimate Meaning: We Don’t Have It, We Can’t Get It, and We Should Be Very, Very Sad,” published in the first issue of this journal. In the first reply, Turp, Hollinshead, and Rowe present an internalist challenge to my account of value, and a relational conception of the self as a challenge to my premise that leading a life includes everything you do and aim at within the project, effort, or enterprise of living and leading a life. I respond to the internalist challenge by showing it does not succeed in inserting values into acts. I respond to the relational conception of the self by noting that, regardless of the nature of the self, the project of leading a life includes all the things you do and aim at within that project, effort, or enterprise. Thus, we can accept a relational account of the self and allow for other-regarding values but that does not change the location of our pursuit of those values: they remain located within the meta-project of leading a life, leaving the meta-project of leading and living a life with nowhere to reach for a point. In the second reply, Cowan argues against feeling sad about life’s pointlessness. In response, I argue that sad facts warrant sadness. I further argue that there are reasons other than happiness to value truth, including the very, very sad truth about the ultimate pointlessness of our lives.",

      "title": "Insurance Looks Ahead",
      "abstract": "Scarcely any adult American can be oblivious of insurance. In one way or another it touches us in every facet of our daily living. By the very fact of our being we are subject to many hazards. In order to appreciate the place that insurance occupies in our economic order, it may be well to note the personal risks and the business risks which each of us runs. Personal risks are of two kinds—the risk of loss of income and of loss of property. Loss of income to an individual or family may result from death, from permanent or temporary disability, from unemployment or superannuation. With the exception of unemployment, this category of risks is the field of life, health and accident insurance. It protects against the financial consequences of dying too soon, of living too long, or of loss of earning capacity through disability. In addition to these loss-of-income risks, to greater or lesser degree each of us runs the risk of property loss through destruction or damage by fire or lightning, water leakage, earthquake, explosion, riot and civil commotion, burglary, theft or robbery and forgery. We run the risk of property loss due to liability for injury caused to the person or property of another by our own negligence or that of our agent where the injury is to the person of an employee or of a stranger or where the injury is to the property of another. In addition to these loss-of-income and properly risks which we run as individuals, we may be subject to the business risk of loss of capital or income from several other causes such as the peril of transportation of goods on land and sea or in the air; hail, frost or other cause of crop failure; defalcation or other misconduct of employees; failure of contractors to fulfill contracts; failure of depositories or unusual credit losses on sales. All of these property risks are the field of the fire, causalty, marine and fidelity insurance companies.",

      "abstract": "The mask or persona will be discussed in the first subchapter. Gintoki and Hijikata both have a mask that they wear to show to other people or society. Gintoki's persona is lazy, childish, and cowardly since his motivation is to live a carefree life, free of obligations, and to project an image that others will not hold high expectations of him. Behind every façade is their genuine personality, which they prefer not to project. The shadow will be discussed in the second subchapter. Their repressed feelings and flaws are contained in the shadow. I will also go through how each character's shadow works. Gintoki's shadow is his guilt about killing his own teacher as a result of being forced to make some difficult decisions. Whereas Hijikata’s shadow is regret of being unable to save his brother. The findings are that a human psyche is complex, and each has his different causes and outcomes.Keywords: samurai, persona, shadow, anima, animus, personality",

      "title": "Unveiling the Identity through the Circuitous Path of Concealment in Long Day's Journey into Night",
      "abstract": "Long Day's Journey into Night portrays a small family who is isolated from the world outside. The members of the family are entangled in their own relationships and the more they discuss the problems the less they are able to solve them, the more they are dragged into the quicksand of failure and the more they get far from reality. The interactions among these characters lead them to the untenable situation in which they have no other choice than being bad or mad. The immediate algorithm of interpersonal perception of I that you know is perceived at first glance but probing more deeply into the interactions, one encounters a more complex algorithm. This play is full of love-hate relationships, paradoxical relationships, syncopations, deceits and concealments which paradoxically lead to the revelation of the identities. Two characters are in one-up position and cunningly manipulate the game of deceit which the other two characters, who are in one-down position, are completely unaware of. It is towards the end of the play that the weaker characters, Mary and Edmund, dare to face the reality and understand that they have been defeated in a chess-like power game set by wiser characters, Tyrone and Jamie. This paper applies the communication theories of Watzlawick and Laing to this play to explore the pathological interactions among the family members and to investigate how the identities are revealed through the circuitous path of concealment.",

Many are new to the school; all are learning disabled. What does that mean to them? Are they damaged by the label, have they failed to learn so often that they no longer believe it possible? They are almost always emotionally scarred; they have been thought of as stupid, lazy, or deliberately inattentive by other students, other teachers, well meaning but uninformed family members, and, most importantly, by themselves. They have known frequent failure. Perhaps they miscue on the sounds that form words, perhaps they can't remember details in stories, or perhaps their writing is illegible.

Some people think that fear affects decisions by changing people’s probability judgements about the outcomes that might be experienced upon choosing one of the available alternatives from the problem space. Fear affects decisions because fear makes people want to run and hide from the problem space. Information economics needs a straightforward way to deal with this. To show how fear affects the decision-making process without changing expectations about outcomes or probabilities, we imagine a haunted house where the new owner must decide (1) which rooms are safe to sleep in; and (2) which rooms must be sealed off to prevent the haunting from spreading throughout the house. We show how Weitzman’s (1979) solution to the “Pandora’s Box” problem can be adapted to this purpose.",

Studying these reactions enables us to explore how predominantly young men traversed the difficult territory between expressions of public and private grief in the Second World War and its aftermath. Awareness of societal demands favouring the ‘stiff upper lip’—the ultimate masculine display of self-restraint—was insufficient to staunch passions. Men showed an acute awareness of the need to demonstrate emotional mastery by restricting their displays of emotion to private spaces and through their readiness to prioritize military and familial obligations over their own personal grief. Despite these conventions, for some men, their determination to mark the feelings they felt for their dead siblings and their memories of childhood companions overcame any reluctance to expose their grief.",

Indeed, most ordinary artists only partially or occasionally reach consecration in its various facets. Yet, while pleasure of practising one’s art is generally the main reason for satisfaction at work, the long-term lack of recognition—or of credible prospects of recognition—is frequently a source of frustration. How do these artists of often humble origins manage to keep their careers going even though the symbolic rewards meant to make up for their precarious conditions escape them? This paper’s central hypothesis holds that the careers of ordinary artists are largely shaped by very unequal faculties to play with their aspirations: some lower them to ensure that the goal of making their childhood dreams come true isn’t immediately an insurmountable obstacle; others adjust them so that their expectations better fit the objective chances of success during their careers; yet others convert them into a new career plan when sustaining their artistic careers no longer appears possible.",

Or at least that’s how it feels when obstacle after unforeseen obstacle hampers your own snail-like progress. We all experience both aspects of this phenomenon at one point or another. Independent research can be extremely satisfying when things are going well, and we can share our excitement with friends, family and colleagues. When things aren’t going so well, however, working on a PhD can become very isolating. Although it may seem like no one else is experiencing problem-x, odds are someone else has, or is, or very soon will be. Discovering that person changes everything. The problems remain but you have renewed energy for unraveling them. The aim of this blog is to explore and reflect on the often difficult or bewildering choices, as well as those exciting and exhilarating moments, that we encountered while completing our recently submitted theses. Some of these issues introduced challenging obstacles to the PhD process, whilst others became excellent learning experiences. We hope that the entries to come will provide solace and inspiration to other new researchers.",

Losses generally bring about fragmentation of routines, of relationships, and of expectations, and frequently imply an alteration in the world of physically available objects and spatially oriented action.

      "abstract": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is extraordinary in the depth of his faith in non-violence and in the simplicity of his mode of resistance. He stands apart because of the nature of his faith, from which accrues its depth, in non-violence. He rejects as illusory the pervasive human faith in the efficacy of violence. Violence, he sees, only breeds more violence and can resolve nothing. Humans always have freshly cobbled or well-worn justifications for violence. The violence they resort to is always 'just' or 'necessary' or 'unavoidable' or pre-emptive. Violence is unlikely to be abolished through violence. Whatever little chance there is of arresting the fast acceleration of violence is solely through non-violence. Non-violence can at best be only aspirational, awaiting progressive realisation in the future. Gandhi's kind of faith in non-violence must for long remain beyond average humans. One of them had promised to provide what he called 'African Replies' to practices of violence and non-violence.",

      "abstract": "“You must forget him/her,” “turn the page,” “move forward,” “say goodbye”... These sayings all epitomize prevalent discourses on mourning. They suggest that what makes grief painful is the fact that one belongs too much, that we cannot grow apart from lost ones and untangle ourselves from distressing bonds. Yet Folk Psychology shows that many people mourn by engaging wholeheartedly in their relationship with the lost one. It is precisely the maintaining of this relationship that proves helpful, rather than the disintegration of such a bond. Narrative therapy considers the process of grief as an opportunity to say “hello again” rather than the obligation of saying “goodbye.”",

La Rochefoucauld says that as a general matter it is harder to disguise emotions we have than to pretend to have those we do not. The truth of this matter seems to require a big qualifying \"it depends.\" It depends on which feelings we are trying to cover up and which we are trying to feign. It is much easier to disguise what Hume called the calm passions than to disguise the violent ones. I can cover up benevolence more easily than my sense of disgust, my sense of satisfaction in a beautiful object more easily than my grief. And though it is not hard to feign interest, concern, amusement, and other emotions that are commonly feigned in routine conversation, one can almost choke at times trying to feign delight in the unexpected arrival of a visitor or in a colleague's big raise.",

It is a loss that reaches far beyond the bounds of the individual. This is clear from the interviews so elegantly conducted by Dr. Shneidman. Rather than putting an end to emotional suffering, it has transformed itself into something different, a new brand of suffering or psychache— a legacy of pain and loss. After reading the interviews, one can have little doubt that suffering persists. We see this in the persistent questions of the relatives and their efforts to explain the loss; it is even evident in the suicide note, with its numerous apologies and reassurances.",

Sin embargo, me desconcertaba el hecho de no saber lo que me impedia materializar lo vivido. ?Seria, acaso, el temor de todo ser humano de exteriorizar sus pensamientos y forma de ser? ?El miedo por exponerse a la critica certera del amigo, conocido, o de sus mas intimos familiares? ?El preocuparse por el que diran...?

Salah satu fobia yang paling umum terjadi di masyarakat adalah Fobia Sosial, atau ‘Social Anxiety Disorder’. Pada karya tugas akhir ini, penulis menyampaikan perasaan mengenai pengalaman sebagai seseorang yang pernah mempunyai fobia sosial. Perasaan tersebut divisualisasikan dalam sebuah ruangan yang diisi dengan objek mata di sekeliling dindingnya. Ruangan yang dibuat gelap, mata yang dibuat dengan teknik cukil kayu yang bersifat keras dan di dominasi warna hitam dan merah juga mendukung munculnya suasana mencekam sehingga apresiator dapat merasakan ketakutan seperti yang penulis rasakan. Perasaan ini ingin penulis sampaikan dengan tujuan untuk berbagi kepada orang banyak, dan meningkatkan kesadaran orang lain akan adanya fobia ini. Karena penulis meyakini bahwa tidak hanya dirinya sendiri yang merasakan hal ini, tetapi banyak juga orang lain di luar sana yang merasakan hal yang sama.",

They can bring them in to the coaching session, where we can celebrate the accomplishments and their consistency, and work with some of the specific critic comments. With some clients, the critics can be relentless at first, and their sessions can involve about 80% critical mutterings.

There are, indeed, many times when it is a matter of the knock at the door, the uninvited presence, the demand for admission: the social workers descending upon those suspected of abusing their children, the industrial consultant 'enriching' the working routines of labourers in factories and offices, the psychiatrist assessing the defendant before charge, verdict or sentence or running 'therapeutic groups' in prison or reformatory; the doctor evaluating a disturbed individual with a view to compelling them to receive psychiatric treatment. But, eagerly or reluctantly, we all too often ask them in, seek out their knowledge in books and magazine articles, listen to them on radio phonein programmes and confessional television talk shows, take ourselves to counsellors, therapists and marriage guidance. And the presence of psy in our contemporary experience is not limited to our encounters with the experts. When we speak to our friends and acquaintances about the ills that trouble us or the hopes that animate us, our conversations will be studded with psychological terms-stress, anxiety, motivation, personality, self-esteem and so on. Even when we are alone, in our most intimate experiences of ourselves, psy allows us to understand the actions of those around us, to describe our personality, passions and hopes, to understand our sorrows and calibrate our disappointments, to project and embark upon a future for ourselves. In being acted upon and acting upon ourselves in these ways, modern human beings (in different ways for women and for men, for the young and the old, for the rich and the poor) have become psychological selves.",

A great way to increase self-confidence and promote a positive attitude, getting out of your comfort zone is sometimes the only way you dig deep enough to get rid of negative thinking.

People may choose to work off their stress in a gym, or relax it all away during meditation or prayer, but for those people with a love of the extreme, the more sedate methods simply won’t work, and will lead to a further build-up of stress and frustration that needs to be worked out.

      "abstract": "Meeting with the wounded body in the therapeutic encounter introduces us to intricate challenges. Physical injury or serious illness may be visible at times and invisible at others. In a society which prioritizes beauty, perfection, and health we find it difficult to be fully present and compassionate for the disabled, diseased or otherwise unusual body. We are caught with unconscious fears, deepening the split within us and leading us to denial and objectification of the wounded body. People coping with serious illness and disability are confronted with physical pain, fear, shame, humiliation, frustration, and social alienation. They crave an accepting attendance and recognition for their wounded body as a whole. As psychotherapists, our presence has a decisive impact on the therapeutic process. Moments of genuine meeting, in which we allow ourselves to surrender to the pain and suffering, and let them move through us, touching and affecting us, when we carry those unbearable feelings with our patients, those precious moments potentiate healing. In this paper, I describe and examine the obstacles preventing us from fully attending the wounded body, and the ways in which we can overcome those challenges and create moments of human interconnectedness leading to mutual growth. I will interweave those issues with sharing my experience with two clients, each coping with a significant physical damage, and my own personal perspectives and experience around illness and disability.

Visitors who travel outside of their permanent residence also encounter similar situations. When a tourist who goes to the hotel is constantly exposed to similar local dishes, he becomes unfamiliar with local dishes.

If we know we shouldn’t do something, for the sake of our health, our pockets or our reputation, why is it often so very hard to do the right thing? </JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Anyone who has ever wondered why they never seem to be able to stick to their diet, anyone to whom the world seems more vain and self-obsessed than ever, anyone who can't understand why love-cheats pursue their extra-marital affairs, anyone who struggles to resist the lure of the comfy sofa, or anyone who makes themselves bitter through endless comparison with other people – this book is for you.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>The Science of Sin brings together the latest findings from neuroscience research to shed light on the universally fascinating subject of temptation – where it comes from, how to resist it and why we all tend to succumb from time to time. With each chapter inspired by one of the seven deadly sins, neurobiologist Jack Lewis illuminates the neural battles between temptation and restraint that take place within our brains suggesting strategies to help us better manage our most troublesome impulses with the explicit goal of improving our health, our happiness and our productivity – helping us to say ‘no!’ more often, especially when it really counts.</JATS1:p>",

      "title": "Extreme Overvalued Beliefs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Just as a delusion, or rarely an obsession, can lead to violence, so can an extreme overvalued belief. Such a belief is often binary, simplistic, and absolute; and it is often more difficult to disprove than a delusion. The forensic cases of Anders Breivik, Dylann Roof, Timothy McVeigh (Oklahoma City bombing), Fort Hood attack (Army Major Malik Hasan), and Cesar Sayoc (mail bombs) are discussed, as well as implications for the insanity defense and death penalty. Carl Wernicke argued that it was possible for any belief to become overvalued, and that an affect‐laden (very emotional) experience often triggers or reinforces the belief. For instance, a depressed or grieving individual, feeling slighted by the government or by society, might convert to a new religion or begin exploring new ideologies. Harvard psychiatrist Oliver Freudenreich stated that those with overvalued ideas (fanatics) may be secretly regarded as heroes, but might not jeopardize themselves.",

Egotism studies can turn out that people who live in places like Catford (London) or Dogtown (California) are more likely to get themselves a pet; that people living in Drogen (Germany) are more likely to use drugs, or that people living on Chopin lane or Mozart street are more inclined to listen to classical music. None of this would show that our choices aren't free in the relevant sense or that we are massively self-deceived about why we do what we do. We are far from omniscient when it comes to knowing our own mental states, and we probably credit ourselves with too much agency in making decisions on numerous occasions.

It is difficult to differentiate between what appears to be a rite of passage and wanting to protect the younger ones from being exposed to violence. Examining the part violence plays in children’s lives means looking into its origin and its place in our culture. We should not try and prevent children from playing what we see as a violent game that reminds us of war, as it means something completely different to them. Playing allows children to absorb their own aggressiveness. But neither can we allow them to be fascinated by violence; we must therefore find the right words and create a distance.",

This article examines the commonalities in the backgrounds of people who take heroic action on behalf of others to theorize the ways in which our society can encourage citizens to prepare themselves to act heroically. In looking closely at a variety of people who have acted heroically, in a single moment or over time, we argue they have at least four crucial commonalities: They imagined situations where help was needed and considered how they would act; they had an expansive sense of empathy, not simply with those who might be considered \"like them\" but also those who might be thought of as \"other\" in some decisive respect; they regularly took action to help people, often in small ways; and they had some experience or skill that made them confident about undertaking the heroic action in question.",

This period as can notice never passes. Even though in the spirit of development at some point begin to separate from the object, begin to acquire our own individuality, as said, Donald Winnicott (1971), never become fully independent, we aim (only) towards independence. This psychoanalytical truth appears in our analysis, in our daily lives. And whether want or not to face the truth, are always dependent on someone or something. In every situation find some aspect of early childhood object. Sometimes it can be aspect of the loss (caregiver, love), and sometimes can be fixated in some aspect of object, for example: strict parent, whose role takes then the religion and its doctrine and dogma. The analysis of this song, so far, does not develop psychoanalytic theory, but it shows its ability to explain the hidden transformations and phenomena that are not only found in the life of dreams, neurotic life, and psychotic products. These wonderful formations can be found in the life of each of us. As has been said elsewhere, by surrendering to the deep psychoanalysis find poetry in our own lives. Each of us has own poetry.",

      "abstract": "For as long as I can remember I have ‘pictured’ the problems solved, the concepts \nunderstood, or the histories read, because for me ‘to see is to think.’ Information \nreceived, situations encountered, or systems experienced, are always being felt as \nmuch as framed because there is always another way to look at something. Reflecting \non these curiosities and capacities raises important questions about what we do as \nindividuals in the various roles we take on as researchers, academics, teachers, and \nartists. What guides these motives and actions are seamless connections that link \nthese roles and responsibilities, perceptions and representations. What glues them \ntogether is an unwavering belief in the pervasive power of creative and critical \ninsight. Yet there is a general misunderstanding about what it means to ‘see’ as a way \nof thinking, acting and making, and how artistic cognition can give rise to powerful \nforms of human understanding. After all, the thoughtful practice of making art and the thought-provoking process of encountering art makes an impact on individuals and \ncommunities through the insights offered and perspectives opened up. This intensive \nactivity is imaginative, sometimes troubling, but it is hard to ignore because it adds to \nthe store of human understanding in profound ways.",

In fact, to project such qualities in a privileged register of categories is a part of a quasi-generalized imagologic strategy meant to valorize the positive character of some traits ethnic, national or belonging to a group. Each country needs a favorable mythology, luxuriant in fairytales, heroes, acts of bravery, one in which to be able to project its obsessions and nostalgias, composing a self image as good as possible.

They also enable us to use our strengths, provide experiences which are more or less challenging, give us the opportunity to get together with friends and make new ones, and can provide choice, positive emotions and a sense of meaning that might otherwise be missing from our lives. But do we all have time for leisure, and are all leisure activities equally beneficial? In this chapter we consider how leisure and wellbeing are linked, the difference between active and passive leisure and explore the characteristics of activities that can promote wellbeing. We end the chapter by considering the role that governments, communities and individuals might play in creating more opportunities for more people to engage in leisure activities which have a positive impact on their wellbeing.",

Suicide causes mortality (and morbidity if suicide attempt) in an individual leading to (a) physical suffering to others by injuring them during-and-after the act, (b) psychological toll on the next-of-kin, and (c) isolation of society due to its suicide-statistics and economic losses with overall loss of spirit to pursue happiness potentially resulting more mortality if morbidity becomes too severe for the affected. What is the story (myth) instigating an individual to commit (or think of committing) the act of self-directed violence? And what is the story (myth) in the society that is allowing the act in some instances while prohibiting and sometimes even punishing the act in other instances? We believe that Switzerland can provide an apt example to understand suicide. Swiss ideology may inspire societies around the world to recognize their stories (myths) when they scientifically decipher prevalence of self-directed violence “suicide” even in nonhuman animals. Consequently, astounding statistics of physician suicide call for action from physicians’ community to understand peers when none can remain untouched by harsh reality of unique stress which physicians’ workspace entails. One of the possible remedies may be thoughtlessness (a form of meditation) which may require strenuous practicing; however, the first step towards achieving it may possibly involve mindfulness (another form of meditation) inspiring peers to learn the need to refocus onto whatever good there is over whatever better there could have been. Essentially, the conception of birth and the birth itself is always planned to be joyful; and the embrace of death itself and the life after death is always purported to be peaceful.",

Por eso permanece fuera y no conoce mas que la fachada. No vive en ella. Esa casa, albergue de sus recuerdos mas olvidados, mas rechazados, es su cuerpo. “Si las paredes oyesen...” En la casa que es su cuerpo, si oyen. Las paredes que lo han oido todo y no olvidado nada son sus musculos. En el envaramiento, en las crispaciones, en la debilidad y en los dolores de los musculos de la espalda, del cuello, de las piernas, de los brazos, y tambien en los de la cara y en los del sexo, se revela toda su historia, desde el nacimiento hasta el dia de hoy. Sin siquiera darse cuenta, desde el primer mes de vida reacciono a las presiones familiares, sociales, morales. “Ponte asi, o asa. No toques eso. No te toques. Portate bien. iPero, vamos, muevete! Date prisa. ?A donde vas tan de prisa...?” Confundido, se plegaba a todo como podia. Para conformarse, tuvo que deformarse. Su verdadero cuerpo, naturalmente armonioso, dinamico, alegre, se vio sustituido por un cuerpo extrano al que acepta mal, que en el fondo de si rechaza. “Es la vida –dice-. iQue le vamos a hacer!” Pues yo le digo que si, que se puede hacer algo y que solo ud. Puede hacerlo. Aun no es demasiado tarde para librarse de las programacion del pasado, para hacerse cargo del propio cuerpo, para descubrir posibilidades todavia insospechadas. Existir significa nacer continuamente. Pero, cuantos hay que se dejan morir un poco cada dia, integrandose tan bien a las estructuras de la vida contemporanea que pierden su vida al perderse de vista a si mismos? Dejamos a los medicos, psiquiatras, a los arquitectos, a los politicos, patronos, esposos, amantes, a nuestros hijos el cuidado de nuestra salud, nuestro bienestar, nuestra seguridad, nuestros placeres. Confiamos la responsabilidad de nuestra vida, de nuestro cuerpo a los otros, a veces a personas que no reclaman esa responsabilidad, que les abruma, y con frecuencia a quienes forman parte de instituciones cuyo primer objetivo consiste en tranquilizarnos y, en consecuencia, reprimirnos. (Y cuantas personas de toda edad existen cuyo cuerpo pertenece todavia a sus padres? Hijos sumisos, esperan en vano a lo largo de su vida el permiso para vivirla. Menores psicologicamente, se prohiben incluso del espectaculo de la vida de los demas, lo que no les impide convertirse en sus censores mas estrictos.) Al renunciar a la autonomia, abdicamos de nuestra soberania individual. Pertenecemos asi a los poderes, a los seres que nos han recuperado. Reivindicamos tanto la libertad precisamente porque nos sentimos esclavos; y los mas lucidos nos reconocemos como esclavos-c{omplices. ?Y como podria ocurrir de otro modo puesto que ni siquiera somos duenos de nuestra primera casa, la casa de nuestro cuerpo?...",

Does this mean that God planned, ordained, or designed the pain (or cancer) to be instrumental in my life for some sort of higher spiritual purpose? If so, why? Why does God allow cancer to invade and interrupt one’s life? There are no theologically sound or definitive answers to these questions. Although asking such questions is basic to our humanity, as we will observe in various passages of Scripture, the answers will always remain elusive. Instead of seeking to answer the question “why?”, I will suggest two areas for theological and pastoral reflection with respect to those facing cancer: humility and hope. Enduring cancer, from diagnosis through treatment, requires humility in mind and body before our Creator and before our caregivers. Cancer also provides an opportunity for Christians to embed themselves in the hope of resurrection and new creation. Resurrection hope is also not reduced to hope beyond death but hope that is manifested now through embodied resurrection “signs” and actions of human sacrificial love, both received and practiced by the patient undergoing illness and by the patient’s caregivers, family, and friends.",

This appears to me to be a very unsafe view. I do not attach much importance to the fact that we cannot always clearly identify our mental experiences as memories, as when we say, 'Do I remember or did I dream that so and so? ' Nor do I regard as crucial the fact that some mental events which do clearly present themselves as memories are none the less deceptive. In cognition we expect exceptions. It would suffice for the intuitive theory if in the great majority of cases when we deem ourselves to be remembering we are in fact in direct awareness of past events.",

      "abstract": "We live amidst an interminable clatter and jostle of discourse; of endlessly proliferating texts; of seemingly infinite regressions wherein to understand A you must first understand B, and to understand B you must first understand c, etc. And yet we muddle along somehow. Most of what we 'know' is there for us because of what we have read or been told; and we make commitments because of it—buy this stereo system rather than that; sign a petition about nuclear disarmament; vote in such-and-such a way at a meeting; see a movie we wouldn't have seen otherwise (and later recommend it to someone else). I am interested here in the grounding of such commitments: in how we can and do achieve a measure of stability; in how we have at times what we think is a reasonable trust in the discourse of others; so that when we in our turn seek to influence others we are not being merely random or arbitrary. I am especially concerned with the groundings that are appropriate to a university community. If I were a preacher, my text might be 'The spirit killeth, the letter giveth life.'",

      "abstract": "Studies • volume 106 • number 422 183 The Rise of Fundamentalisms and the Concept of Sin1 Megan Loumagne Where are we? Conceptual artist Barbara Kruger’s piece entitled ‘You Are Not Yourself’ was created in 1982.2 The piece depicts the face of a woman in distress reflected in a shattered mirror, the accusation ‘you are not yourself’ overlaid on top. Kruger’s work has been highly acclaimed and heavily awarded, with installations in prominent art galleries around the world, and this image in particular captures something significant about the experience of life in an age of posts – post-modern, post-religion, post-structuralist, post-colonial, posteverything . It connotes pain, fragmentation, loss, disorientation, violence, uncertainty about identity, and more specifically, uncertainty about even the possibility of being able to understand one’s identity. Perhaps an even more apt slogan for this image would be, ‘You can’t know if you are yourself’. The anxiety evoked in the viewer mirrors the anxiety of the contemporary mind that cannot find anything reliable upon which to ground hope rather than despair as a fundamental orientation to existence. Thisinteriorfragmentationanddisorientation,causedbyavarietyofseismic shifts in philosophical, economic, sociological and scientific factors leads manyinourtimeto‘profoundfeelingsofalienationandnon-belonging’.3 Even though we live in the era of globalisation and electronic inter-connectedness, this has, it seems, paradoxically heightened rather than ameliorated feelings of loneliness and isolation. This pervasive sense of alienation, the lack of belonging and identity, the uncertainty and disorientation, are significant both for the consideration of the rise of fundamentalisms, as well as of contemporary developments in doctrines of sin. If Kruger’s image captures something significant about where we are, how did we get here? What does it have to do with doctrines of sin and with the Church more broadly? And how can we understand the rise of fundamentalisms? While there may be significant overlap among various fundamentalist The Rise of Fundamentalisms and the Concept of Sin 184 Studies • volume 106 • number 422 movements around the world, I focus on the example of fundamentalism within North American Protestantism because of its significant visibility in the media and the general public through figures like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, and the extreme fundamentalist activities of Westboro Baptist Church.4 There are certainly important connections to be made between North American Protestant fundamentalism and other fundamentalisms, but that task lies beyond the scope of this essay. Due to limitations of time and space, and because of my desire to avoid caricaturing fundamentalisms as one monolithic category, which wouldn’t reflect the complexities of reality, I primarily focus on North American Protestant fundamentalism. Additionally, this article does not pretend to present an exhaustive study of as controversial and complex a topic as fundamentalism. It simply seeks to illuminate some of the complexities of the relationship between fundamentalism and Christian reflection on sin, and to propose some considerations for contemporary theological reflection on sin in a time when fundamentalist movements are perhaps gaining renewed momentum. Relevant philosophical developments Understanding the rise of fundamentalism within North American Protestantism in all of its complexity would require a detailed analysis of the myriad factors – including wars, social movements, economic issues – that led to it. However, for the purposes of this paper, I focus mainly on philosophical and theological developments. To begin, I distinguish the term ‘fundamentalist’ from ‘conservative’ or ‘traditionalist’, following a similar move made by Martin Marty and R Scott Appleby in their encyclopedic eight-year study of various fundamentalisms around the world.5 While both conservatives and fundamentalists have a concern for orthodoxy, the term ‘fundamentalists’ refers to those who view themselves and their religious beliefs as under attack by the broader culture around them, and who are willing to engage in battle in a variety of different ways to defend what they perceive as religious truth. As Marty and Appleby describe, ‘Fundamentalists see themselves as militants . . . [they] begin as traditionalists who perceive some challenge or threat to their core identity, both social and personal. They react, they fight back with great innovative power’.6 This is not meant to imply that fundamentalists or religious people more broadly are not ‘under attack’ in some legitimate ways in our time, and Megan Loumagne...",

The contradiction between its potential, subjective being – its inner aim and life – and its actual being is removed; it has attained full reality, has itself objectively present to it. But this having been attained, the activity displayed by the Spirit of the people in question is no longer needed; is has its desire. The Nation can still accomplish much in war and peace at home and abroad; but the living substantial soul itself may be said to have ceased its activity. The essential, supreme interest has consequently vanished from its life, for interest is present only where there is opposition. The nation lives the same kind of life as the individual when passing from maturity to old age – in the enjoyment of itself – in the satisfaction of being exactly what it desired and was able to attain … In order that a truly universal interest may arise, the Spirit of a People must advance to the adoption of some new purpose; but whence can this new purpose originate? It would be a higher, more comprehensive conception of itself – a transcending of its principle – but this very act would involve a principle of a new order, a new National Spirit.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As we live our lives, we make decisions that shape our future selves and circumstances. When making such choices, such as whether to start a family, or which career to pursue, we often try to assess our options by imagining what different futures would be like. This book argues that, for choices involving dramatically new, life-changing experiences, we are confronted by the brute fact that we can know very little about our subjective futures. If we make major life choices, choices that can even change who we will become, in the way we naturally and intuitively want to—by considering what we care about, and what our future selves will be like if we choose to have the experience—we only learn what we really need to know after we have already committed ourselves. If we try to escape the dilemma by avoiding an experience, we have still made a choice. Choosing rationally, then, may require us to regard big life decisions as choices to make discoveries, small and large, about the nature of experience, and to recognize that living authentically involves experiencing one's life and preferences as they evolve from the choices you make. Using classic philosophical examples about the nature of consciousness, and drawing on recent work in normative decision theory, cognitive science, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind, this book develops a rigorous account of transformative experience that sheds light on how we should understand real-world experience and our capacity to rationally map our subjective futures.",

      "abstract": "and hegemonic, absorbing our own story, so that we measure our lives by an objective standard—narrative though, not dogmatic— rather than by our sense of the spirit in our present life, out of which the narrative of encounter has come and on the basis of which it is sustained. We, in fact, are living several stories at once; the particulars of our life can be ordered in various patterns. The big Story takes elements of our story and puts them into a certain pattern. If this pattern becomes hegemonic, we lose sight of the various elements in our life that do not fit and thus obscure the transformative efforts of the whole-making as well as holy-making spirit—who is bigger and deeper than any story, who “searches everything, even the depths of God” (1 Cor. 2:10; RSV)—who seeks ever to expand and deepen our being to include these alien particulars. We may also be living the same story by telling it differently. What then constitutes it as the same? Is it the same telling, the same words recounting the same events, or the same spirit in relation to whom we render it in different words illuminated by different moments of experience? Our need for theology is evident in the telling of our stories— which Miller embraces—and in making us aware of the dangers in that story-telling. It is evident as well in thinking about the meaning and realities encountered in the practice of waiting in silence—which Miller and I are suggesting Read consider. And, it is evident in the effort to find a commonality among Friends, for to think about the meaning of our meeting together is to ask after the ultimate significance of human being with each other, as part of our being in the world, which is what Quaker theology reflects on—through the language of our Quaker, biblical, and secular heritage. If the search for commonality is a theological undertaking, how can theological reflection help us along? It can investigate both our practice and our faith. We can describe our different practices— whether as waiting in silence or praising Christ—and look for the common spirit at work within it. We can tell our own stories and the bigger Story we see it as part of, and listen to the different contents and styles of others’ stories, and through these seek for the common holy spirit. I do not think we can find our unity on the explicit level. I agree with Read that we do not find it in belief; but Miller would agree. I do not think we can find it in looking for a uniformity of plot or of narration. Our unity, I believe, is rather in God and in relatedness to creation beneath all explicitness in our tacit commitments and 14 Quaker Religious Thought, Vol. 88 [1997], Art. 3 http://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/qrt/vol88/iss1/3 THE QUAKER VISION AND THE DOING OF THEOLOGY • 35 connectedness. We do approach these within the Quaker context, present and past. However little or much is known, and however differently it is understood, we have chosen to join or to continue as part of this particular conversation on faith and practice rather than some other Christian or non-Christian one. What I am suggesting is that our unity is ultimately found through the “spirit of God” in “the hidden unity in the Eternal Being,” which “opens all things” to us, within us, whose “wonderful depths” are, however, “beyond what can by words be declared.” (Fox, Journal 28) Penultimately, our unity is in dialogue amidst our Quaker context. The theological question then becomes what will facilitate such dialogue? Then need for theology becomes evident in finding a way to speak and to listen to our stories, beliefs, practices, and understandings of our Quaker, biblical, and secular contexts, that sustain, enrich, illuminate, and make problematic this dialogue. Such dialogue can be life-giving, edifying, and community-building if we approach one another knowing that our meeting is in this hidden unity beneath words, which enables us to accept, and even to learn from, our differences. Drawing upon the more inclusive, caring elements in our diverse practice, faith, and stories—as the spirit opens us—we can be graced by otherness. Then we can live in the “love and unity” of which Isaac Penington speaks: For this is the true ground of love and unity, not that such a man walks and does just as I do, but because I feel the same Spirit and life in him, and that he walks in his rank, in his order, in his proper way and place of subjection to that; and this is far more pleasing to me than if we walked just in that track wherein I walk....The great error of the ages of the apostacy hath been to set up an outward order and uniformity, and to make men’s conscience bend thereto, either by arguments of wisdom, or by force; but the property of the true church government is, to leave the conscience to its full liberty in the Lord, to preserve it single and entire for the Lord to exercise, and to seek unity in the light and in the Spirit, walking sweetly and harmoniously together in the midst of different practices. (Renfer 213) 15 Keiser: The Quaker Vision and the Doing of Theology Published by Digital Commons @ George Fox University, 1997 36 • R. MELVIN KEISER THE QUAKER VISION’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD OF THEOLOGY What can we say, then, in conclusion, to the question of the conference, in what ways has the Quaker vision contributed to the discipline of theology? The answer is “Not a wit,” judging by the Protestant scholar’s remark. There was a vigorous theological exchange between Quakers and other Protestants in the seventeenth century. Samuel Fisher, in his eight-hundred-page Rusticus Ad Academicos, answers point by point the written attacks on Quakers by such leading Puritan theologians as John Owen and Richard Baxter, and contributes to the beginnings of higher biblical criticism through extensive arguments about the sources and formation of the biblical canon, with the purpose of refuting their identification of scripture with the Word of God. But his efforts are forgotten in biblical scholarly history with the passage of time. Significant writings of Penn and Barclay also exhibit this Puritan-Quaker dispute, but Penn is remembered for his contributions to the making of modern government rather than to outcomes but without the unnecessary baggage of theological thinking. Yet such effects in the world were incubated within the minds and hearts of Quakers seeking, as they understood it, to sink down into the measure of the life and to manifest that life as led into both word and deed. To the degree that liberal Friends do not reflect on their commitments in doing good, and to the degree that evangelical Friends do reflect on their commitments but do so not in the life but adhering to objective forms, the scope of action is curtailed and the depths of spirituality are restricted in energizing, sustaining, and imagining such ways of being in the world. If our theology has in fact been so potent in its impact on social life, even though having no noticeable effect on others’ theology, perhaps there is further socially transformative potential in Quaker theology. In any case, there are contemporary theologies that, like Quaker theology, are focused on doing theology so as to overcome social oppression. From these Quakers can learn—such as how to do systemic analysis of social oppression—but can also contribute insofar as our theology is grounded in a spirituality of divine presence—in a sinking down into the measure of life from which comes both action and words, and their integration. 16 Quaker Religious Thought, Vol. 88 [1997], Art. 3 http://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/qrt/vol88/iss1/3 THE QUAKER VISION AND THE DOING OF THEOLOGY • 37",

Twenty-six pictures, created by LGBTQ + migrants (ages 19-39), were analyzed with their accompanying narratives to document participants’ experiences. Thematic and narrative analyses starting with the sensitizing concepts of hope, uncertainty, and disillusionment yielded three themes: (a) Yearning for freedom and acceptance before and after migration; (b) Dealing with uncertainty, disillusionment, and the grim realities of being an LGBTQ + migrant; and (c) Retaining hope for the future amid pain and struggle. Feeling isolated, participants yearned for societal acceptance and freedom to be themselves. This motivated their migration, but once in South Africa, they faced many social-structural challenges and developed feelings of disillusionment. Still, several retained hope, imagining safety and freedom not as an unreachable destination but as a future yet to come. Research and practice implications are discussed.",

Each situation is a good opportunity to make the receiver associated with the subject matter. However, the way of its presentation makes a lot of objections in many scientific environments. The subject to death is given very rarely in mass media deepen by philosophical-religious reflection which is so important to proper human’s development. It is rather presented in violence images, murders, catastrophes, wars, conflicts or lately numerous terroristic attacks, which on the one hand arouses fear, on the other hand because of high mass media frequency makes the receiver accustomed to the view of death. And it leads to the receiver’s becoming indifferent.

The author analyzes descriptions of experience and qualitative unstructured interviews with commentaries, conducted especially for the purposes of this study, as well as her own experiences, which is typical for the method of phenomenological research. Various experiences of gift giving that did not take place are presented in the article. The first one can be defined as refusing of the gift – when an individual bringing a whiskey bottle in gratitude for his boss’s help was kicked out from the latter’s office. The second case comprises instances of memory loss from the perspective of the gift giver and the receivers. Numerous interviewees were not able to remember any gifts received from their spouses, although the gift exchange in the family was practiced during holidays every year. However, the gifts that some close persons had forgotten to give, or that were repeatedly given, present quite another matter from the point of view of the giver that still remembers them. The third case comprises the gift that was meant yet not given – a work of art dedicated to a well-known musician, but staying in the interviewee’s home. The fourth case centers on a dramatic story of a woman who abnormally accumulated stuff in her house during her whole life, but has not once given anything to her family. After her tragical demise in a fire, her family members found various things at her home and reshaped their personal attitude towards her, making the author to reconsider her attitude as well.The analysis reveals ways in which the ungiven gifts both reflect and affect the interpersonal relationships, and possible meaning and place of these experiences in people’s memory. The impossibility of the gift giving is recognized in every story as a state of uneasiness, as a certain lapse in time. It indicates a shift in perception of the interpersonal relationship and highlights the necessity of re-evaluation of the relationship that was supposed to be established by the ungiven gift.The ungiven gift puts people off their stride, depriving them of the possibility of time for a while: it makes them understand that the Other is actually different from that Other, who the subject imagined existing in their mutual relationship. The rational consciousness feels lost, and until it finds another “I” in relation to the Other, the only possible relationship is the one between “I” and “Myself”, which is separated from the world, time, and existence. However, the individual can move from the state of passive helplessness and adopt an active role in the mastership game. The concept of the mastership game presupposes an objective to influence the world that does not belong to the individual like the Other, but can be appropriated as a masterfully created game instead, subsumed by way of recognizing the meaning.The mastership game is a creative movement that presupposes searching for a new meaningful form. Thus, the gift is also a creative act: while being unable to influence the Other, the subject becomes engaged in a game and replaces the intersubjective relationship with a connection between the subject and the object (gift). Therefore, two mutually immanent subjects are related by the gift that makes their interrelationship meaningful; or, likewise, become separated, when the gift is not given.",

This will sometimes happen after a long period of indecision or when things are extremely difficult, as they have long been for the country, in most homes and among ordinary individuals. Watching one's life savings dwindle away, the nest‐egg laid down for security in an uncertain world, is a frightening process. This has happened to the nation, once the richest in the world, and ot its elderly people, most of them taught the habit of saving in early youth. We are also taught that what has been is past changing; the clock cannot be put back, and the largesse—much of it going to unprincipled spongers—distributed by a spendthrift Government as token relief is no answer, not even to present difficulties. The response can only come by a change of heart in those whose brutal selfishness have caused it all; and this may be a long time in coming. In the meantime, it is a useful exercise to consider our assets, to recognize those which must be protected at all costs and upon which, when sanity returns, the future depends.",

In a country like South Africa, and many other postcolonial societies, this is a question which demands address, as religious and spiritual discourses pervade public and private life in ways that they may not in more secularized European contexts. In particular, how do we write credibly, sympathetically, and yet critically, about beliefs which we may not share (in the case of this article belief systems referred to in official discourse as “traditional African”, and often more colloquially as “witchcraft”), but which constitute the day-to-day realities of life for so many people – in which issues ranging from love relationships, to employment, housing, families, sport, health and security are mediated through a complex system of spiritual practices, which often emerge in public discourse generally only in their negative or sensational aspects. And in so doing, how do we rethink, reread and rewrite the larger issue of the place of the religious or spiritual in postcolonial modernities. I take as my case study two fascinating texts by Adam Ashforth on the subject of “witchcraft” in Soweto: Madumo: a man bewitched (2000); and Witchcraft, violence and democracy in South Africa (2005).",

      "title": "When the Joy of the Mother Is Missing - an Organic Perspective on Postpartum Depression",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: An adaptive lens widens the exploration of postpartum depression to include the consideration of a mother's own primal history and its resurgence through the initiation of childbirth, her preparedness to thus meet herself and be seen by her baby, her experience of labor, birth, and the postpartum period; implications for a healthy attachment with her child and thus that child's lifelong development; and a call to recognize postpartum non-separation as an essential protective factor against postpartum depression. KEY WORDS: Postpartum depression, attachment, mirroring, infant mental health, interpersonal neurobiology, postpartum separation, malattachment, disconnection, anhedonia, depression, parenting, motherhood, mothering, childbirth. INTRODUCTION Postpartum depression is one of those terms like love-it trips off our tongues, we assume we know what it means, we do know that it is important and serious, but it remains quite abstract. What does it really look like (and feel like)? A web search easily turns up a list of symptoms: extreme fatigue, loss of interest in activities, sleeplessness, sadness, tearfulness, anxiety, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, irritability, appetite change, poor concentration. However, postpartum depression can almost always be detected by a single, simple screening question: Is the mother feeling joy? If she is suffering from any form of postpartum depression, the answer may be a straightforward No. But more likely it will be, Well, I know I'm supposed to feel joy... and sometimes... occasionally... there are brief hints of joy... kind of... (Brooke Shields' (2006) self-portrait of postpartum depression, Down Came The Rain, articulates the experience in a raw, immediate and brilliant way.) THE BABY SHE ONCE WAS Is AWAKENED Many new mothers experience what I call Chronic Covert Postpartum Depression (CCPD). They suffer behind a facade of frantic perfectionism that effectively obscures the possibility of even considering that there might be something wrong. As a result, all the helpful information available about postpartum depression doesn't even get near their radar screens. Years ago I wrote (1995) about my own struggles with a CCPD that I didn't truly recognize until very recently. I described my ... vague but persistent fears of incompetence, an intangible but relentless drive running deep inside me to always be trying to do it better, or at least do it right. Do what right, I couldn't define. I just knew that I rarely felt a respite from this steady pressure that seemed to define my life after becoming a mother. And it seemed that I was angry, silently resentful, most of the time. When there were no specific tasks to accomplish, like diapering or feeding or driving us somewhere, I felt deep discomfort at simply being with my baby. I had learned from my RIE parent/infant class that babies and children thrive on this wants-nothing time, that it's as nourishing to their psyches as food is to their bodies. But as soon as I would sit down on the family room carpet with my baby, to just be there while he explored and played, the resistance would rise up and I would quell it by suddenly thinking Oh, I've got to jump up right now and call about those slipcovers, or Maybe I should plan tomorrow's dinner, or I'd better go wipe the water spots off that table. The refuge of life's droning busywork. We had planned for Ian to sleep in a cradle in our room during the early weeks, but on our first night home his snuffling baby noises kept me so on edge, his closeness so chafed at me, that he was alone in his own room beginning the following night. Then I could feel tense and guilty from safely down the hall. My first years of mothering were thus: my need to escape Ian's crushing dependency on me, and the guilt, the anger, and the ever-present gnashing conflict of my two deepest impulses-to attach, and to pull away (not necessarily in that order. …",

      "abstract": "It is clear that we cannot distinguish the sane from the insane in psychiatric hospitals. The hospital itself imposes a special environment in which the meanings of behavior can easily be misunderstood. The consequences to patients hospitalized in such an environment-the powerlessness, depersonalization, segregation, mortification, and self-labeling-seem undoubtedly countertherapeutic. I do not, even now, understand this problem well enough to perceive solutions. But two matters seem to have some promise. The first concerns the proliferation of community mental health facilities, of crisis intervention centers, of the human potential movement, and of behavior therapies that, for all of their own problems, tend to avoid psychiatric labels, to focus on specific problems and behaviors, and to retain the individual in a relatively non-pejorative environment. Clearly, to the extent that we refrain from sending the distressed to insane places, our impressions of them are less likely to be distorted. (The risk of distorted perceptions, it seems to me, is always present, since we are much more sensitive to an individual's behaviors and verbalizations than we are to the subtle contextual stimuli that often promote them. At issue here is a matter of magnitude. And, as I have shown, the magnitude of distortion is exceedingly high in the extreme context that is a psychiatric hospital.) The second matter that might prove promising speaks to the need to increase the sensitivity of mental health workers and researchers to the Catch 22 position of psychiatric patients. Simply reading materials in this area will be of help to some such workers and researchers. For others, directly experiencing the impact of psychiatric hospitalization will be of enormous use. Clearly, further research into the social psychology of such total institutions will both facilitate treatment and deepen understanding.

Both fieldsites are brimming with ‘ghosts’ (Tsing et al. 2017) of past digital infrastructure projects, partially patched up, left incomplete or in precarious almost-readiness. Some infrastructures bite back, becoming risky companions, causing conflicting moral obligations. While not striving to get ready, grow or move on, leaving things as they are requires much. Our fieldsites are not careless or malicious by waiting or hesitating, and yet doing nothing is uneasy.

      "title": "Some Affective Bases for Guilt: Tomkins, Freud, Object Relations",
      "abstract": "Some Affective Bases for Guilt:Tomkins, Freud, Object Relations Adam Frank (bio) My contribution to this special issue begins by retreating slightly from the topic and turning quickly to the intimately related one of shame. I do this, no doubt somewhat guiltily, because I find it easier to think about shame than guilt. In fact, I dislike thinking about guilt for many reasons, the most salient being: I am made uncomfortable by the proximity between the legal meanings of guilt and the psychic ones as explicated by the great moderns (Nietzsche, Freud); the felt need to accommodate their ideas on the subject in my own writing; the impossible virtuosity demanded by such debt dynamics, payback, making equivalent, and so on. It seems like a hopeless, discouraging situation, a particular kind of hopelessness or malaise which these writers would precisely identify as the symptoms of a guilty conscience: there are promises I must keep, contributions to civilization I must make. Thinking about guilt, they (and you) might say, makes me feel guilty. And this would be true, as far as it goes, but to leave it at that would be both more self-aggrandizing and less precise than I would like. I find it more useful to say that thinking about guilt makes me angry, or perhaps contemptuous, or frightened, or excited, or ashamed—or combinations of some or all of these affects held together differently to compose distinct [End Page 11] emotions; that is, what goes under the name \"guilt\" may include a number of different ways of feeling and ways of thinking about feeling. In classical psychoanalytic theory guilt can appear to be less a substantive emotion with a shape, texture, and movement of its own than a symptom of a structure: the conscience-constituting relation between super-ego and ego in Freud's later structural model of the psyche. But according to Silvan Tomkins, whose affect theory I will be working within this essay, guilt names several distinct feelings that have tended to be collapsed together: the core affect of shame when interpreted in a specifically moral field, a punitive contempt directed toward the self, and a feeling often following on anger and violence that accompanies an intention to atone or repair that which has been damaged. This essay will bring Tomkins's understanding of these affective bases of guilt into relation both to Freud's writing and the less normative approaches of object relations theory. My goal here is to unfold aspects of Tomkins's affect theory as it offers greater descriptive and theoretical scope and variety for the difficult task of understanding socio-psychic formation than the classical psychoanalytic assumptions about repression; my sense is that these latter may continue to be serving as silent operating assumptions for much literary and cultural criticism. * * * Guilt has not played much of a role in the turns to affect in literary and cultural criticism of the last ten years. As very different as the writing that falls under this loose rubric has been, much of it shares a couple of important characteristics: an active interest in thinking about relations between psychic and social domains that are not exclusively linguistic, and a shyness about, or a more staunch rejection of, the category of \"the subject,\" although often this may come with a marked interest in subjectivity or subjective experience. In bringing Silvan Tomkins's affect theory into my own critical writing, I have been wanting to make use of his acute phenomenological accounts of feeling, his broad grounding in twentieth-century empirical psychology, social science, and philosophy, and his specific revision of the psychoanalytic theory of the drives. Informed by mid-twentieth-century cybernetics and systems theory, Tomkins steered a course between the two prevailing psychological theories of his moment, behaviourism and psychoanalysis, both of which tend to undertheorize the role that consciousness plays in human behaviour and experience.1 Like Freud, Tomkins wanted a theory that included the possibility of motivational error, or the idea that we may be wrong about our own desires or [End Page 12] wishes. But where Freud located this possibility in the relation between conscious and unconscious processes as they record and realize the...",

      "abstract": "Chairman Kanner: Every day of man's life constitutes a transition between yesterday and tomorrow, converging in the intrinsic values of the moment. The past and present continue to shape and modify directions and goals, mostly through quiet evolution, sometimes in lively spurts. One of the liveliest spurts occurs during adolescence, at a time when a person is no longer a child and not yet an adult. Many incisive changes take place in that period. Body growth, in a remarkable upward surge, attains its maximum for the individual. The physique assumes its characteristic configuration. Sexual development reaches procreative capacity. There is striving after emancipation from sheltered existence, a trend toward increasing self-dependence in thought and action. The sphere of interest and participation expands from the confines of home, neighborhood and school to the community at large. The choice of vocation, until then a playfully considered matter, becomes a real issue. Current standards and precepts are submitted to criticism not as yet leavened by the tests of experience. The established order is challenged boldly and then, after some struggle, appropriated gradually with more or less reservation. Adolescence, in our culture, is a great translator. It translates the language of parental direction, attitudes and behavior into an individualized idiom. This is much less evident in primitive cultures. One might go so far as to say that in primitive societies there is no conceptual equivalent for that which we call adolescence. Childhood ceases abruptly when, through a set of elaborate rites, it is transported into full-fledged adulthood. Tribal ritualism, rather than personal spontaneity determines status and function. In our social structure, a child is given several years in which he is to find his way from a more or less manipulated and regimented existence to the acquisition of initiative in a loosely competitive environment in which the taboos are blurred, the semantics are equivocal, and the variety of occupational, political and theologic choices offers opportunities for perplexities. The adolescent translator's dictionary is full of confusing synonyms and antonyms. A combination of inner soundness, wholesome parent-child relationship, and guidance from understanding adults, helps most adolescents to emerge safely from the groping and floundering which precede maturing stabilization.",

      "title": "Bisexual and Gay Husbands: Their Stories, Their Words,",
      "abstract": "What happens when married men face their gay/bisexual needs?This astonishing volume offers an intimate look into the lives and thoughts of bisexual men. Already married to women, these men are undeniably attracted to other men. Their struggle with conflicting needs, desires, and loyalties is not filtered through theories or evoked in brief interviews. It comes straight from their own keyboards. The stories told in Bisexual and Gay Husbands are taken from an Internet mailing list, which allows people to speak freely and in anonymity, yet also encourages the development of a tightly knit community. Men at all stages of the coming-out process share their experiences, their secrets, their pain, shame, anger, and hope.One man writes, “I have found the answer to my bisexual needs and am afraid to embrace it. I need help and advice to know what to do. What you people have done in your lives may hold the key to helping me decide on a course of action. I am either going to create a dream come true or hell on earth as I destroy my marriage. I can’t tell which, and of course you can’t either. But you CAN tell me how you are handling the problems I am facing.”Bisexual and Gay Husbands includes advice and information on the issues that touch these men most deeply, including: how do I tell my wife and kids? what does it mean to self-identify as bisexual or gay? what kinds of relationships do I want with men? can triads work? how do I deal with my children’s reaction? do I have to leave my wife?The insight, intelligence, and honesty revealed in Bisexual and Gay Husbands make it a riveting read, but it also has great clinical and historic value for therapists, sex theorists, and bisexual men and their families.",

For example, you are aware of your environment, your breathing, or the chair that you are sitting on. The subconscious mind or the preconscious mind consists of accessible information. You can become aware of this information once your direct your attention to it. Think of this as memory recall. You walk down the street to your house without consciously needing to be alert to your surroundings. You can talk on the cell phone and still arrive home safely. You can easily bring to consciousness the subconscious information about the path to your home. You can also easily remember phone numbers that you frequently use. It is possible that some of what might be perceived to be unconscious becomes subconscious, and then conscious (e.g. a long-forgotten childhood memory suddenly emerges after decades). We can assume that some unconscious memories need a strong, specific trigger to bring them to consciousness; whereas, a subconscious memory can be brought to consciousness more easily. The unconscious mind, consisting of the primitive, instinctual wishes as well as the information that we cannot access. Although our behaviors might indicate the unconscious forces that drive them, we donâ€˜t have easy access to the information stored in the unconscious mind. During our childhood, we acquired countless memories and experiences that formed who we are today. However, we cannot recall most of those memories. They are unconscious forces (beliefs, patterns, subjective maps of reality) that drive our behaviors.",

      "abstract": "As an education scholar and poet, I investigate experiences of fearfulness in order to promote learning how to live with a commitment to love. I have lived my life in fear, full of fears. Now I am practicing accepting myself, acknowledging the hollow in my heart, acknowledging the holes that sometimes look like gaping wounds but are really integral to my search for wholeness. And as I learn to know myself as a subject-in-process, a person under construction, I also learn to live in relationship with others in daily experiences written with words of patience, hope, and affection, for giving each other and all of us possibilities for living with love. Love is a commitment and a practice. Love involves a daily devotion. In order to love others, we must first love ourselves. We cannot learn to love by attending to the abstract and universal. We need to begin with small acts of love. We can begin with the person we are drinking coffee with. If we are going to change the world, if we are going to undo the damage and destruction of prejudice, hatred, and fear, we need to start with love. We need a curriculum of love. In order to learn the wisdom, philosophy, and practice of love, we need to acknowledge that we are not alone, independent, autonomous. We are part of a vast network of connections and interconnections, all ecologically sustained in rhythms and memories and hopes.",

These days it's easy to work harder and harder, constantly pushing ourselves and those around us so that we and our congregations can be \"successful.\" We forget that our drive to succeed can prevent us from taking the time to stop and listen for what God is calling us and our congregations to be. This book is one pastor's story of his journey from a success-oriented drivenness to a significance-oriented, meandering style of life. What you will find are reflections from a fellow traveler who is now less desirous of doing something spectacular for God and is instead committed to doing something significant with God--who is discovering a more grace-filled, Spirit-led way.",

As they see the end approaching, as they perform techniques for the last few times (techniques they may have performed hundreds of times before), they grow more and more restless, more and more impatient. Even recalling what they have been through-the stress, the hurdles, the physical work-is exhausting. These students are weary of the whole graduate school thing, weary even of the projects that once held their interest. In short, they have reached the point where they can no longer stand being students. They picture what life will be like at the next, perhaps postdoctoral, stage of their careers; they seek a fresh start on exciting new research in some other lab, perhaps in some other part of the country. The work they are doing now is holding them back; every little delay at this point, such as the need to do another analysis, an experiment that has to be repeated, an error that has to be rectified, is irksome and intolerable. They have reached the breaking point. They want out.",

      "title": "What<i>Kind</i>of Person Will<i>Your</i>Child Be?",
      "abstract": "THERE IS A wIDE-SPREAD MYTH ABOUT children-the kind of human beings they are and how they grow-that certainly needs to be investigated. The myth is that adults are very different from children-that in the process of growing up the characteristics of childhood gradually drop off and different characteristics, those of adulthood, are taken on. Most of us parents act as though we believe this myth. We enjoy the funny little things they do and say, we discipline their naughtiness, and we endure many hours of fretting and fussing and no cooperation-all in the faith that these things will be dropped by the wayside as time goes on. We find ourselves saying as we look back on one of those days filled with trying experiences, “Oh well, he’s only a child. We must give him time. He won’t be like this when he grows up.” Unfortunately, that may be only partly true. He probably won’t write on the walls when he grows up, and he probably will come to learn some manners. But his emotional response to the world -how he acts when frustrated, how he gets what he wants, how he responds to strange adults and plays with other children--these things change very little. The spoiled little girl of three is often a spoiled wife at twenty-three and the boy who is the bully on the play-ground is usually the domineering ruler in his family. True, most adults don’t throw tantrums but “sick headaches” are often just as useful. The traits of personality that make each of us an individual, different from every other person in the world, find their beginnings in the experiences of the child long before he goes to kindergarten. His home and his parents, whether they are aware of it or not, start him out on the kind of person he will be. Is your family composed of persons? What else could it be composed of? You are probably thinking of the word persons as meaning people, and it does mean that. But it also has another meaning, something like what we mean when we say “He’s a real person!” That’s the meaning I want to talk with you about. If you know a family that is composed of real persons, you can tell it in a minute. There’s a distinctive flavor about the way they live together. You experience something in their home that makes you glad you know them, and you wish to be like them. These families that are made up of real persons have some very definite qualities. For the most part these qualities are simple and almost obvious and, yet, not many families have them. The reason they don’t is that these qualities are attitudes, and attitudes are not easy",

The latter, it may be argued, inevitably entail a problematic distance from everyday reality and may thus be said to embody life “on holiday.” On one level, this is surely true: big stories, insofar as they entail a significant measure of reflection on either an episode, a portion of a life, or the whole of it, are a step removed from those everyday goings-on that are the focus of small stories. Far from necessarily being a liability, however, the distance that is intrinsic to big story narrative reflection creates opportunities for understanding that are largely unavailable in the immediacy of the moment. Big stories and small stories thus complement one another; taken together, they represent a promising integrative direction for narrative inquiry.",

Are we concerned for freedom from constraints, interferences, manipulations? Or are we, rather, concerned for freedom as an ongoing achievement, freedom for choosing and acting on our own initiatives? Are we born free, or do we become by means of learning, questioning, acting on shared commitments? Is active participation in public life essence of freedom? (Foner, 1996, p. 7). Benjamin Barber (1992), like many other American commentators on our heritage, tells us that the fundamental task of education is apprenticeship of liberty learning to be free (p. 4). There are few who would disagree that possibility of freedom is an aspect of our individuality. Like all possibilities, however, it must be actualized to be meaningful; and actualization depends upon surrounding circumstances and, crucially, upon conscious involvement with other human beings in world. As I view it, it has much to do with spaces: public spaces and private spaces and, yes, inner spaces that imagination can open up when it discloses untapped possibilities.

The process of analysis harnesses the remarkable power of the psyche to encounter, engage, unlock, survive, transform and heal. However, even though a meaningful relationship with another human being may feel unthinkably dangerous, the psyche will prod with nightmare, symptom or psychic pain until we listen to its voice within. One solution to the pain of uroboric identification is to create and control an \"other\". Some people may produce \"others\" in the form of children, whose birth might, sometimes catastrophically, crack the defensive ring. Or, if creating one's own flesh and blood feels impossible, creativity might find another outlet. Producing a company of \"others\", as self-objects in the form of artwork was the way Amanda had coped with her difficulties before she arrived in my consulting room.",

The worker who attempts to achieve communication with the child's inner world is therefore operating in highly sensitive territory; here, timing, patience and an ability to demonstrate real empathy are essential.",

There is no writer whose obsessions do not begin from the “reality” (which I put in quotes) or life itself, which are also thoughts and images condensed from outside- in, this is, from an outer world towards an inner world, wherefrom a whole imaginary structure is arisen. A writer is within himself and in his surroundings. He is the inside and the outside. The frustrating character of his writing is derived from this awareness. It goes from tradition to the rupture and chooses the ways they are defined. He chooses and develops, every single literary style is being made, undone and rebuilt. Only apparently we write in our oddity: some pieces of the puzzle remain lost in the first book and return as the one who returns on his path; the wish of being someone else promotes a leap forward, which takes by surprise those who never expect the writer not to wear masks, although it happens that the writer is a mask : person. It is imperative to mimic, to be something different, or to be only a bridge leading to who we are not. Novel is this: mediation and mask.",

      "title": "Waiting for Godot",
      "abstract": "This chapter takes the form of a journey in pursuit of an answer, exploring several layered forms of impairment that have punctuated, and sometimes shaped, an academic life. Some were, unbeknownst to the author at the time, self-inflicted. Others were reactive to exogenous and critical events or experiences that sometimes abruptly, even dramatically, impacted upon the journey. Samuel Beckett's play 'Waiting for Godot' is used as a metaphor encapsulating some aspects of the journey, especially its start and ending. Three figures who both challenge and support the author shape the journey – an academic supervisor, a close teaching colleague, and a research collaborator. The narrative opens by discussing a search for clarity that never came and culminated in a breakdown. It moves on to subsequent morbidity, as suppression and negation shape an original perspective on reflexivity as a limit experience. Distance and relocation present a new form of estrangement while establishing a career in another country and the final movement addresses the experience of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and alienated from one's own body. While this segment is unresolved, the author nevertheless endures and remains.",

      "abstract": "Courage is dangerous. If it is defined in traditional ways, as a set of dispositions to overcome fear, to oppose obstacles, to perform difficult or dangerous actions, its claim to be a virtue is questionable. Unlike the virtue of justice, or a sense of proportion, traditional courage does not itself determine what is to be done, let alone assure that it is worth doing. If we retain the traditional conception of courage and its military connotations–overcoming and combat–we should be suspicious of it. Instead of automatically classifying it as a virtue, attempting to develop and exercise it, we should become alert to its dangers. And yet and yet. There is an aspect of traditional courage that serves us: we require the capacities and traits that enable us to persist in acting well under stress, to endure hardships when following our judgments about what is best is difficult or dangerous. If courage is checked, redefined as the virtue that enables virtue–the various sets of dispositions, whatever they may be, that make us resolute in worthy, difficult action–then we need not fear the dangers of courage. We need rather to reform it by diversifying it, as a heterogeneous variety of traits that enable us to act well under stress, against the natural movements of self-protection.",

      "title": "Accomplishments of the Frail‐Old",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—The frail-old are the minority of those over 65 who are dependent and unable to perform activities of daily living. They do not accomplish the same tasks in the same way the rest of us do. To think of the accomplishments of the frail-old, one must expand the common definition of accomplishment, at once relaxing and refocusing it within a different context. The frail-old may accomplish for themselves. They may close ancient wounds and come to grips with their lives as lived. They may find friends, happiness, and love, and come to peace with their role in life. The frail-old also accomplish for others. They are faced with the situation of coming to terms with death while weakened and dependent, but with a lifetime of experience to draw on. It is this unique perspective of the frail-old that allows them, while alive, to make their inestimable contribution to the rest of us. My grandfather was a stout, certain, demanding man straight from old Germany. I remember his long period as frail-old. When he was too weak to go outside, he canned applesauce by the hour; when he could no longer do this, he wrote poetry; and at last he sat in his room and listened to the television. Once when my mother was away he became incontinent of stool. He thanked me, a boy of 14, when I cleaned the mess: “I know it is a bad job.” Perhaps I am a geriatrician because of him, or because of this one grudging remark. He taught me reality, commitment, and, at the last, some of the spectrum of love. My grandfather's words and manner taught me the problems he had labored against and often beaten. More, he taught me about my difficult father: how far my father had come, how progress is made from generation to generation, the hope that the next generation will be a little wiser. A little while ago I happened on a scrapbook my grandfather made; he had made it when I thought he was able only to watch television. It consisted of decades of pictures glued onto its leaves. The glue was so thick the individual pictures had to be cut out to make copies of them. The book was made to last, to be a present to my generation, and the next. The world of the frail-old does not consist of waiting to die. It is, if one looks, an unpublished series of accomplishments, and the accomplishments are not small. I would not have argued if my grandfather had chosen suicide rather than face the long decline. Instead, he gave me gifts of the richest kind.",

      "title": "Temper Tantrums in Young Children",
      "abstract": "A temper tantrum is a violent outburst of anger. An­ ger is a basic human emotion that is manifested early in infancy and continues throughout the life span. Anger is a normal reaction to frustration, fear, or other stress. Some children seem more angry than others early on, but their anger should diminish as they learn to cope with the world. During early childhood, children often have fits of anger that seem volcanic in intensity. Their rage may include behaviors such as screaming, cursing, breaking things, rolling on the floor, crying loudly, hit­ ting, or running around the room. They may even vomit, hold their breath, hit their head, or run off to hide. Tantrums seem to appear in stages, with an early warning of “clouds on the horizon.” This is followed by the actual tantrum, which usually lasts minutes and may seem an eternity to the adult in charge. Finally, after the tantrum is a period of “hangover,” when the child is tired, red-faced, runny-nosed, and needing to be held. Often after this last stage children are ready to continue on as if nothing has happened! There are ways to prevent tantrums, and there are ways to deal with them when they occur. One of the most important things for the adult to know is not to get caught up in the child’s anger—this will make the prob­ lem last longer into childhood. Providing the model of proper human emotions is very important to the child. If you spot the storm signals, such as increased noise level, red face, and brow-lowering, try to change the situation before the tantrum occurs. During the tantrum, it is suggested that adults remain nearby and provide neutral or warm support to the child. That is, ignore the tantrum behaviors, but let the child know by your pres­ ence that you are available for help. During the tantrum is not a time for discipline, for this is an emotional outburst that does not leave much energy for learning. After the tantrum, however, adults can provide words to the child to help learn why there was anger and how it felt. If the tantrum occurs in pub­ lic, and the parent is embarrassed, it works to sit or re­ main near the child, smile to passers-by, and let others know you are in control even though the child is not. Lack of reinforcement usually shortens the tantrum. After the tantrum, continue on with the public activity. If the tantrum occurs at home, it is possible for the adult to move away out of sight of the child yet remain nearby. Some psychologists recommend isolation or “time out” as a consequence of a tantrum. Provide rewards for non-angry behavior. Try to fig­ ure out the causes of the child’s anger. Sometimes ill­ ness, hunger, and fatigue may be causes. Frustration is a common reason for tantrums, so try to reduce the causes of frustration. Providing language is an important tool for children to use for managing their emotions. Know that tantrums peak at age four and may occur to age six before they diminish. Some tantrums may be expected of all children. Our goal as parents and caretakers is to help children learn to recognize and deal with their emo­ tions so that tantrums become a behavior only found in young children—never in adults.",

We are thrilled when our national team wins the World Cup against stiff competition, angry when protesters in another country burn our flag, excited as the party we voted for wins the election, and disgusted when local college students brawl drunkenly with a neighboring school. Despite the obvious impetus that intergroup behavior is to emotions, the idea that emotions may actually be intergroup phenomena is not so much controversial as it is, at least in social psychology, unconsidered. Emotion is typically assumed to be an individual phenomenon, triggered when an individual interprets events as either favoring or harming his or her personal goals or desires in the context of whether he or she has the personal resources to cope or not. Yet such approaches do not seem to fully capture the kinds of emotions evoked by our examples. Unless we are a member of the national team, caught by mistake in the demonstration, up for election, or one of those actually involved in the brawl, none of these events may impact us directly or personally. Yet because these events touch those we are close to, those we identity with, those we feel part of or one with, we, too, experience emotion.",

      "abstract": "Overthinking merupakan sebuah kecenderungan pada seseorang dalam memikirkan suatu skenario, permasalahan, atau kejadian dengan durasi yang berlebihan dan tanpa henti. Orang yang mengalami overthinking sering kali terperangkap dalam siklus berpikir yang berulang, fokus pada setiap detail, menganalisa skenario tentang kemungkinan terburuk, meragukan keputusan sendiri, dan kesulitan menghentikan atau mengalihkan isi pikiran mereka kepada hal lain. Dalam buku self healing “Overthinking is my hobby, and I hate it” karya Alvi Syahrin membahas berbagai hal yang sering kali dipikirkan secara berlebihan oleh orang-orang terlebih remaja akhir yang memasuki masa transisi menuju dewasa. Hal-hal seperti hubungan dengan orang lain, pendidikan, karir, dan sebagainya merupakan persoalan umum yang dipikirkan dan dibahas dengan cukup baik dalam buku ini. Namun tidak semua orang menikmati kegiatan membaca buku terutama dengan perkembangan sosial media yang semakin pesat, orang-orang cenderung lebih menyukai media visual seperti gambar dan video yang bisa dilihat dengan waktu yang singkat. Setelah dilakukan pengamatan untuk mendapatkan kesimpulan dan solusi berkaitan dengan upaya penyebaran informasi dari buku self healing tersebut menggunakan metode 5W+2H, bisa ditarik kesimpulan bahwa komik merupakan media yang belakangan ini mengalami peningkatan pada peminat yang terutama berasal dari kalangan anak muda, ditambah dengan semakin mudahnya penyebaran informasi di sosial media seperti Instagram, X atau Twitter, Tiktok, dan semacamnya. Solusi yang pada akhirnya diputuskan untuk dipergunakan adalah komik strip. Komik strip merupakan solusi yang dipilih karena merupakan media visual yang simpel, menarik perhatian, juga bisa dilihat dengan waktu yang singkat. Dengan menggunakan Instagram sebagai media penyebaran informasi, diharapkan informasi tersebut bisa menjangkau target secara lebih luas dari sebelumnya.Kata kunci: Overthinking, self-healing, Informasi, Komik strip",

We live in an America where we doubt the sincerity of our closest friends, family, and mentors, where we assume that all our politicians have ulterior motives.

      "abstract": "Self-expression is one of the most basic needs of human beings and one of the seminal ways in which self can be expressed is through the articulation of one's deepest desires, fears and feelings. Often, this expression is at odds with surrounding society and this necessitates courage to still be oneself unmindul of the consequence. Else, the urge to live life true to one's inner reality precipitates an escape from the environs that constrain one's individuality. It is further, true that expressing the self does not predicate the realizacion to the self in psychological or philosophical terms. It only implies the urge within a person to be able to asseverate the feeling, the thought, the moment, no matter how bewildering or tenuous. Besides finding an identity through place and the past, a person also establishes identity through expression-functional and creative. Therefore, together with the continuous process of finding a place, the unceasing endeavours to be heard, seen, acknowledged and articulated are important to human beings. This aspect of voicing is particularly pronounced in people who have either been silenced or who have never found an opportunity for self-espression.",

It is not uncommon for the arts to leave us somehow ill at ease, or for them to prod us beyond acquiescence. They may, now and then, move us into spaces where we can create visions of other ways of being and ponder what it might signify to realize them.",

Enabling a presence to be commemorated, and by extension in some way perpetuated, at a special place or site appears to have become increasingly important – even when such commemoration might be deemed intrusive and inappropriate by others (including local councils and custodians of national parks).\r\nKeywords: memorial benches; special place; trees; commemoration; Loch Lomond.",

Observing Sao Paulo – a completely different capital than Rio de Janeiro, which can't be compared to Porto Alegre, which in turn, contrasts with Belo Horizonte, and even more with Salvador or João Pessoa – is fascinating. The worlds each individual lives in become their scenery, their landscape. A scenery for their lives, to find singularity, for “soul-making,” according to a major line of archetypal psychology. In this sense, soul-making is based on the relationship each person establishes with internal and external objects. A few feelings walk hand-in-hand and are even confused for the accelerated demand of modern society. One accelerates to search something. Just as a search for deceleration carries a request from the soul, a search for acceleration carries it too. It teaches people that acceleration requires reflection, otherwise it becomes empty, compulsive, purely defense or escape.",

However, in the aftermath of grave wrongs it is sometimes appropriate for perpetrators to apologize even if it is impossible for survivors to forgive.

What can victims do when they cannot forgive? Grappling with these questions through a case study, Brudholm seeks to extend our concept of apology.",

Generally speaking, especially in our environment of constant hurry and distraction, we tend to be disconnected from the body, even when we are not in the midst of grief. Reconnecting to our most intimate somatic experience in safe, compassionate, and measured ways can ground us in a place of confidence, allowing us to move into and out of our felt emotions of bereavement, without being overwhelmed. With growing practice and self-awareness, this can allow for the safe and contained exploration of grief’s rough and raw terrain, and ultimately facilitate the release and relief from the most acute, and sometimes chronic, pains of loss.",

      "abstract": "A father is as important as a mother in mental development of a child. A father helps his child get into the world from being embedded into his mother. A father also gives his child a chance to modify harsh inner objects through playing, not competitions. However, some fathers have severe narcissism and castration anxiety to play this role. ‘Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2’ by James Gunn is a film about two fathers. One father is narcissistic and unable to lose; the other father is not so narcissistic and is able to lose. In the end, one father is killed by his own child and the other father just disappears by himself. It seems to symbolically show what is happening in the child’s inner world. A child’s father sometimes does, but sometimes does not agree to losing. The father of a child sometimes disappears by himself, but sometimes he disappears only after being killed by his child. When a father disappears, he leaves the child a legacy, which is the autonomy of the child and the courage to get into the world. The waning of his father begins from the oedipal phase until when father actually disappears, i.e. he is deceased in an external reality. Therefore, we could say a child acquires their knowledge about the world through his mother, but he gets the courage to go to the world through his father.",

Dating or developing friendships involve intricate narratives about one's self and requests for such narratives from the interlocutor – a matter of 'getting to know one another'. Meetings will start with a sequence in which everyone present tells his or her name and a couple of biographical and/or professional items sufficient to situate one's self in relation to the group and the occasion (when the meeting is professional, one is not likely to start off by saying 'Hi, I am so-and-so and my marriage is falling apart'). In highly bureaucratised societies we have to flash our identity every time we enter into contact with administrative bodies, and in the job market, a written genre called the CV together with several other modes of talking about one's self play a crucial role. When we go to watch a sports game, we are likely to shift into another identity gear and wear caps, T-shirts, and banners with 'our' team's logo or colours. On the day of our country's independence or of our king's birthday, we get the day off because we are citizens of that country. And when abroad, we discover ourselves talking a lot about that country, living up to its stereotypes, defending its values and virtues, and in return receiving flak because of the mistakes it made or makes.",

One of the characteristic romantic tropes related to this idea occurs often in The Prelude, where among the glories of the self is the ability of its faculties to expand outward in all directions (Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged), absorbing and thereby affecting more and more of what is outside itself. Wordsworth had a greedy soul that could nearly always enrich itself from whatever material was at hand. That, for some, was a kind of health, though perhaps it was no more than luck, the fortunate combination of a particular self and a special set of circumstances.

Yet, you can see, hear, and feel fear everywhere. And that, while there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Everything happens as it is supposed to: there is a season for everything. Instead of being fearful, we should enjoy the perfection in things and focus on the positive, trusting that there is a plan and a purpose for everything. Obtaining education, traveling, learning from the people we meet, but most of all, realizing that our attitude is the key to our perception of life, are crucial ways to help us make this world a better place for ourselves and others. Rejoicing in Being My license plate says ONERTH - we live on one planet, with one group of people, one group of animals, one group of trees and plants, all from the same source. In my life, I try to be an example (or a teacher) to all I meet: an example of health, happiness, peace and prosperity. I try, and have always tried, while in the business world, to present myself well. I believe in starting my day with an attitude of gratitude; we all have so many blessings, and yet, many of us are filled with fear. The Problems we Face Have you noticed how much fear there is in people today? Was this fear in our parents' and our grandparents' lives? From the moment we get up in the morning, we are bombarded with reports about economic downturns, schools that are doing poorly, the failing stock market, robberies, terrorist threats, natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, diseases... the list goes on and on, so as to make us want to pack up and leave. But where would we go, where would we hide? Hasn't there always been crime, greed, murder, didn't our parents and their parents experience the same things? The Power of Faith Here is what I believe about fear: There is nothing to fear but fear itself! Let us remember who we are - we are all children of God who created the earth and everything on it, who made us in His image and whose hand is over all things! Let me repeat: there is nothing to fear or be afraid of! As the saying goes This, too, shall pass. We must look within ourselves and realize that in Him, all things are perfect, beautiful, and complete. I believe that, if I have faith and work hard on myself, this truth will be made manifest. I believe that we don't NEED anything and that there is enough. I remind myself continually to take my eyes off of what I see and hear on television or on the radio or what I read in e-mails; there has always been news, good and bad, and there always will be! When we get up in the morning, let's remember that we are all whole, complete, and perfect - no matter if things APPEAR to be otherwise! (Yes, even when we look in the mirror and see a new wrinkle here and another bulge there.) As it says in the Bible, there is a season for everything; so let us instead see the perfection in things and focus on the positive, there is a plan and a purpose for everything! We need to remind ourselves of this and remember that there are no accidents and that everything happens for a reason. The Lessons that are All Around I have always felt strongly about educating the mind, body and spirit, which has taken me years of study to perfect. I have had an opportunity to travel the world, see some of the greatest art and hear the finest music, and have probably seen and experienced more than most. …",

Our work is about identifying needs, co-designing programmes of learning, reducing barriers and addressing power imbalances. To understand why what we do matters, as community workers we need empathy, something which arguably cannot be taught. The work we do is complex and we are frequently asked to step outside our comfort zone and engage across differences. The work we do is demanding as we seek to engage with communities at times and in places that reduce the barriers for them; can be heart-breaking as we see the discrimination faced by the communities we serve and the trauma that they carry with them; it is sometimes risky and we often find ourselves working against the desired outcome of our employer or funder.

      "title": "Teaching Singing Using a Dancer's Mentality",
      "abstract": "I AM CONVINCED THAT DANCERS are generally more mentally and physically disciplined than singers. Dancers usually stretch before attempting any choreography, whereas singers often dive into repertoire with cold muscles. Perhaps this is because dancers, like athletes, are taught from a very early age to warm up before intense physical activity and cool down after it, while often left to their own devices in early childhood, might only get those messages much later in life.Dancers also understand that learning to dance requires patience with initially low expectations, while singers expect quick results and have high expectations prematurely. Dancers learn that muscles take time to develop strength, coordination, flexibility, and endurance. They are comfortable with the message that clumsy precedes graceful, while singers want to sound good immediately and don't necessarily see clumsy as a means to an end.Gross generalizations? Unsubstantiated opinions? Perhaps, but after forty years of teaching singing, I continue to experience all of the above as true. Take a singer's fear of high notes, for example. Singers don't like to sound bad, especially on high notes, so they frequently back off in ascending note phrases and quit before the sounds turn sour. These vocal acrophobics sabotage themselves at every turn by not allowing the singing system to work through the process of muscular development.Dancers, on the other hand, working on a physically challenging exercise-say, a double pirouette after learning to do a single pirouette-might approach the task with the idea that a systematic working of the muscles necessary to accomplish the task would, over time, solve the problem. Dancers would accept the fact that they might be clumsy and awkward initially and are OK with failing at the beginning. They understand how to turn clumsy into graceful and ugly into beautiful.I like teaching dancers to sing. They get it. They understand the process, the journey. And, if they start behaving too much like singers, it's relatively easy to get them back on track by reminding them of their dancing experiences. So, perhaps we'd make more progress as teachers of singing if we included in our pedagogy a bit more of the dancer's mentality.For example, do we applaud ugly and clumsy singing in the studio when ugly and clumsy singing is the only way to get to a certain goal? For both amateur and professional alike, do we delineate between performance mode and training mode? Performance mode should be in the singer's physical, mental, and emotional comfort zone-predictable and secure. Training mode, however, should include many excursions into the uncomfortable zone-unpredictable and unsecure. In the studio and practice room, we need to safely and systematically stretch up to and then out of our comfort zone in order to eventually master certain techniques. Awkward is OK in the studio. Awkward is not OK at auditions and performances, unless, of course, the character breakdown demands it.What else might we learn from our dance colleagues? Dance teachers use a fact-based pedagogy that respects and obeys the laws of nature, while singing teachers often teach as if the laws of nature don't apply to the physical act of vocalization (Direct the sound so it bounces off your skull). Dancers make use of the most up-to-date information from a variety of disciplines such as kinesthesiology, biomechanics, and psychology to maximize training and performance. Walk into your local dance studio and tell the instructors that you want to work only on the left side of your body. After they recover from the shock, they might tell you that balance is necessary for a healthy, functional body, and that training only one half of it would not encourage such balance.Yet, how many singing teachers are still exercising their students' voices in one register and muscle group? What about the head voice teachers who have only female sopranos and no altos or belters in their studios because they are training only half a voice? …",

I was not aware of my emotional inexpressiveness until I saw myself in a video or heard myself on recordings. Now I feel emotions more, but this does not mean to say I express them. I sometimes exaggerate the expressivity to compensate. I still don't handle it well when I feel very sad but I can't cry. I found it a great relief to meet ABI survivors who experienced the same thing, even though it is a much more common side effect to have emotional lability, which is difficult to handle in social situations.

      "abstract": "G enerally speaking, when someone in our society is he assumes that he has a disease, but how he feels is ill. When a great many people in two different cultures (New York City and rural Jamaica, West Indies) were asked what the phrase ill meant to them, virtually all of them-little children, adults, the aged, and even physicians-responded by saying simply that it meant not being healthy. Being healthy was being fit, they said, being able to go or do when you want to. Being was being unfit or unable to do. No diseases were mentioned (except by very little children who talked about cuts and tummyaches and the like). On the other hand, if you do feel and someone asks you what is the matter, you will commonly respond with the name of a disease. You will say, have sinusitis; instead of, My head is clogged and I have a postnasal discharge. Or, rather than telling of the griping pains in your abdomen, you may say that your colitis is acting up. In other words, you will supply disease terms to explain the feelings of illness and assume that all such symptoms are caused by some disease or another, or that they are emotional in the sense of not being real. However, the assumption that illness and disease are the same is, I believe, culturally derived. The assumption may be based on what has been repeatedly and objectively demonstrated, but it has also become a part of the beliefs of the culture of the so-called Western societies. As such, the assumption no longer depends for its existence on continued proof. It is now an article of faith against which other assumptions can be tested. It can be used as a basis for",

      "abstract": "We experience some rapid and unexpected changes especially within the incoherent and asunder school policies and implementations that are unsuitable for the demands and expectations of school stakeholders. Furthermore, the internal and other external obstacles and non-ideal situations such as lack of resources, negative school climate, less motivation, organizational conflicts, cultural matters, depersonalization, or resist to change surround the schools today. All these tend to produce serious organizational stress and turn into organizational viruses at the school level. Exploring the non-ideal situations affecting today schools, the present study conceptualizes a resilient leadership model with reference to the school system in the face of chaos and complexity. Although describing the resilient leaders seems difficult we can say that resilient leaders do not seek pretext for struggling against difficulties, and when non-ideal situations occur they can shake but stand up. Such leaders that we expect like a tree which can withstand a storm run in downpour, like a dam which can hinder strong waves, or like a flower which can blossom in the snow. They may not be superman or supergirl but at least they are mentally, emotionally, socially, ethically, and physically strong humans who beat the odds. In turn, resilient leadership can be defined as displaying high level of endeavor to overcome the both internal and external obstacles that the organization faces, and generating different solutions despite the fact that many non-ideal situations affect the organization. At the end of the study, in the face of such situations, some potential characteristics of the resilient school leaders are suggested.",

Primary sources are those records that people in the past have themselves created. In each generation those who would learn about the past must go back to these records and examine them for themselves. This is not a privilege to be enjoyed merely by professional historians. Without access to primary evidence nobody can make contact with life as it has passed through time, nor become fully aware of the historically created community to which each of us belongs. The universal use of history or social studies texts in the nation's schools contradicts this rule. Textbook writers usually put together their material by relying upon secondary sources. They tell of events which too often they have only read about in the works of others but which they themselves have not examined at first hand. The result is a dull, lifeless narrative. The history text may serve a purpose as a work of reference where one may check a fact, an event or a date. It is not easy to give such a book the title of literature. It fails to capture the drama of human existence or to mirror its joy and its pain. Because they dehumanize the story of humanity the texts stunt the intellectual and spiritual development of students and teachers alike. Daily contact with these books generates boredom rather than curiosity. The judgment of numberless Americans is summed up in six words: I hated history in high school.",

      "title": "Vocal effort in situation",
      "abstract": "Oral communication is an interactive and situated activity. Vocal effort is strongly related to both interlocutors' situation. In natural situations, when no microphone or loudspeaker is used, the interlocutors are immersed in the same environment. They are aware of their mutual distance and location as well as of the ambient noise and reverberation. They can react either orally or visually toinform the other person about the success of the oral transmission. They may be able to move closer to each other. Some implicit rules apply: the talker routinely raises his or her voice when the interlocutor stands at a distance exceeding a few meters, or when the noise level is significant, or when the interlocutor is known to have hearing problems. Conversely, the talker lowers his/her voice when the interlocutor is close by, or in a silent environment, or in a reverberant room.\r\n In order to reach a distant listener, the talker has to articulate more distinctly or to speak louder, or both. Speaking more clearly means a cognitive effort, speaking louder provokes signal distortion, fatigue, loss of privacy. The talker's actual vocal effort is a tradeoff, specific to each situation, between the vocal effort to produce and the communication efficiency. In a given social group this tradeoff is known by everybody, as demonstrated by the fact that, when confronted with a new situation, one instantly adopts the appropriate level of voice to address the targeted listener. One may hypothesize the existence of an half conscious norm for the vocal effort, which defines, in most typical communication situations, the notion of a normal voice in terms of muscular commands, auditory voice control, and acoustic features to be received by the interlocutor.\r\n The purpose of oral communication may not be limited to the transmission of linguistic information. As with attitude, gesture or clothing, slight deviations from the norm may be used to transmit non-linguistic information, for instance to assert a dominant position, to convey acceptance or refusal, or to express anger or satisfaction.\r\n While the dynamic range of the human voice extends up to some 60 dB, its timbre changes widely from the whispered voice barely audible at a 10 cm distance, to the shout, which can be heard over a distance of several hundred meters. Even after level equalization, the timbre variations retain enough information to distinguish at least 3 voice categories: whispered, conversational, and shouted. Within each of those categories, it is not clear whether level perception is categorical or continuous, although the second category may easily be divided into soft, medium and loud.\r\n The acoustic cues associated to the vocal effort have been widely investigated. They include the sound level, the frequencies of F0 and F1, the average level of the middle and high parts of the spectrum, the level discrepancies between voiced and noisy parts of speech, the vowel lengthening, the fragmentation of the discourse into shorter utterances, and the tendency of hyperarticulation, all of which contribute to ensuring the correct reception of the oral information by the interlocutor. However, the way in which these cues are combined to yield the perception of a given degree of vocal effort has not been established yet.\r\n In the last century, systems allowing recording, amplifying, modifying and preserving the sound have invaded our lives. In some cases they allow to breaking the contextual link and interaction capability between speaker and listener. The implicit norm of voice strength evoked above hasevolved. New communication situations have appeared, which do not destroy the traditional ones but add up to them.\r\n Current speech synthesis and recognition systems, conceived as purely passive devices, do not take into account the contextual and interactive aspects of oral communication. This results in severe limitations for the user. This approach may change in the future, under the pressure of users requiring more efficient speech/voice human-machine communication tools.",

In this PechaKucha, we will explore how “user” and “researcher” perspectives echo each other as they interact. We acknowledge the delicate nature of these sensitive conversations, and we respect the difficulty of embracing vulnerability. This talk is a reflection on embracing the awkwardness of social taboo, and share more publicly about a sector that is highly regulated, competitive, and private. We will take the audience on a journey, from avoiding social friction – because the topic is taboo and uncomfortable, to letting social friction arise, and finally, feeling liberated by it.",

The story brings to life how invisible mental illness can feel, how hard it is to put a name to the struggle, and how therapy and support can slowly bring a sense of hope and healing. It also encourages free dialogue on mental health to foster compassion and reduce stigma. With the use of personal experience and global definitions of mental health, the article focuses on the fact that anxiety struggles are real, valid, and require attention. These reflections are meant to remind anyone walking a similar path to trust their healing, however slow or uneven it may feel. They are also an invitation to open up conversations about mental health, so that it becomes something we discuss with honesty and compassion, rather than silence and stigma.",

The unpredictable psychological feeling called grief is usually accompanied with emotional setbacks like; anxiety, depression, insomnia, anger, feeling of guilt, sadness, despair and yearning among others determines the level of attachment to the loss and so the likely period of bereavement. The unfortunate circumstances seem to manifest themselves even among animals particularly mammals for example; chimpanzees exhibit silence behavior around the dead member, gorillas use sign language and even expressing sadness about the deceased member, elephants display destructive unusual habit on seeing motionless member, some deer mostly sniff and poke while looking at their lifeless deceased among others. However, this paper attempts to define the concepts of grief, mourning, counselling and bereavement practices by various groups around the world, with much emphasis on Igbo people of South-Eastern Nigeria as well as its counselling implications.",

So the children “think a wonder thought” and start to fly. But they keep falling down. “What's the matter?,” asks Peter, “All it takes is faith and trust. Oh, and something I forgot, pixie dust.” Then Peter Pan sprinkles the children with pixie dust and they fly off into a wonderful childhood adventure. We sometimes get lost in the routine of our day-to-day business, programming hearing aids and resolving feedback and wax problems. But we are not in a product business. We are in the people business and, like Peter Pan, we need to know a lot about faith, trust, and pixie dust. FAITH It is human nature to misjudge and overestimate problems. Many patients believe nothing can help them hear better. They fear they are “falling apart” or they are too old to be helped. Fear can lead to fright and panic. But faith can conquer fear. When new patients seem apprehensive, I tell them, “Don't worry, your case is simple. I have been in this business for many years and have sold more than 10,000 hearing aids. This is easy. Let me show you.” I then take a high-quality BTE hearing aid and attach it to a listening scope. I adjust the aid to produce loud, clear sound and I have the patient and the spouse listen to the aid. Most patients are surprised and delighted when they hear loud, clear amplification. “Can you hear me?,” I ask. “Oh, yes,” they usually respond. Their fear starts to dissipate. The patient must have faith that I know what I am doing and that I am an honest, easy-to-work-with person. I help create trust by demonstrating my expertise and keeping everything ultra-simple from the patient's point of view. TRUST One of my referring physicians tells his patients, “You can trust Dr. Martin. He won't play games with you. I sent my father to him.” These 17 words instantly instill faith and trust in new patients and make my job easy. Most of my business comes from existing patients referring friends and family members. These new patients also tend to trust me since I have proven to be trustworthy to their friends. Trust must be earned. Do a good job. Be a decent person. Don't play games. People will recognize your professional strengths and abilities. Years of honest, straightforward work will translate into a public perception that you are a person of integrity, a professional to be trusted. PIXIE DUST Do you believe in magic? You should, because you need it in this business. Magic is created in many different ways. For example, consider cooking. Espie, one of my secretaries, told me, “I put love into my cooking. I tune the radio to a station that plays salsa and I sing and dance when I cook. When we eat, we always pray first, then I turn the radio on softly so the flavor of the music gets into the food.” Floyd, one of my patients, said, “Competence must always come first and there is no substitute. But people, especially people of our generation, are looking for much more. Compassion and sincerity are very important to us. A professional, a doctor, has to be able to listen well. He also must be a positive individual, motivated to make everything successful. When you have a problem, you want your doctor to say, ‘We will take care of that.’;” I asked Floyd, “Do you believe in magic?” “Well,” he answered, “I think what you are talking about are charisma and integrity. People shop for price and service, but they remember how they felt doing business with you.” Roy Bain, a hearing aid specialist and instructor, said, “Never see a patient without first putting sparkles into your eyes. Stand in front of the mirror and look into your eyes. Say to yourself, ‘I need to be at my best. This patient deserves my best.’; Turn yourself on. Throw away all negativism and turn on compassion.” As for me, I believe in magic and pixie dust. Three years and 6 months ago, I first saw my little boy via an ultrasound image. He was about 3 inches long. He is now 38 inches tall. When you see a child's mind and body grow from tiny cells you have no choice but to believe in magic. Helping people hear is a gift I have acquired over the years and a gift I enjoy. I have fun at work. I enjoy people. I pass around jokes. I make fun of the local baseball and football teams. And, when I need more help—more pixie dust—I call on the experts with whom I've developed working relationships. None of us stands alone. We can give each other magic. CONCLUSION It is impossible to work in this business for many years without using magic. The job is too tough. Magic cuts through the doldrums. Magic energizes compassion. Compassion binds people together. The next time you run into a really tough hearing aid fitting, remember, “All it takes is faith and trust and pixie dust.”",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article studies volunteerism through the phenomenon of dropping out. By ascertaining the achievements, difficulties, and dilemmas of volunteers at the Center for Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, we explored the process of dropping out as an encore to understanding the meaning of volunteerism that ends with abandoning a desired activity. On the basis of a longitudinal study, we argue that dropping out is not always a product of waning motivation—for many volunteers, dropping out was extremely difficult—but rather the outcome of unabridged discrepancies between “ought” and “actual” experiences. Volunteers expect to feel good about themselves. In contrast, the organization expects them to act as free agents who can independently manage feelings of pain and self‐doubt. When such discrepancies between expectations and reality occur, feelings of anger and disappointment set in. As a result, devoted volunteers drop out in order to preserve their positive self‐feeling. It is our contention that in order to understand the nature of volunteers' dropout and perseverance, close attention should be paid to processes of self‐regulation in the context of the specific relations between the volunteers and the organization.",

      "abstract": "What does it mean to regret? How do we react to our past deeds? This question may look simple: we did something wrong, and we regret it because now we know it to be wrong. We may have been wrong in doing something that we knew we should have not done. And the reason, for example, may be our lack of courage. Then in this case we regret our lack of courage and swear to be courageous the next time (or at least try to). In such case, the answer to the first question is simple at least in theory: to regret means to identify what precluded us from doing the right thing so as to be able to do right the next time. Regret in this case means to identify the correct answer and resolve to apply the correct answer in the future. However, there is another kind of regret. We may regret our past deed because it turns out to be wrong in retrospect while we judged our deed to be right at the moment. In this case, we may still swear not to make the same mistakes again. However, there is a critical difference between the first kind of regret and the second: the standards of right and wrong, which must be applied in the act of judging, have altered through the passage of time in the second case.",

      "title": "A Conversation for the Holidays",
      "abstract": "As we gather with family, friends, patients and their families this holiday season, it may be a wonderful time to have The Conversation, the one that allows us and the people we care about to talk about the last stage of life, while being firmly grounded in today. It's not easy to talk about how you want the end of your life to be, even more difficult, to ask others. But it's one of the most important conversations you can have with your loved ones.1 Talking to your loved ones about what you or they want for end-of-life care is a conversation, one that should happen with you at present. Each person is their own best expert on what he/she wants and needs. Medical and legal people may become a part of the discussion later, but it should begin with you. Cofounder of The Conversation Project,1 Ellen Goodman, began this work to provide a framework for this difficult discussion. The project is dedicated to helping people talk about their wishes for end-of-life care. Goodman realized that too many people die in ways they wouldn't choose, and too many of their loved ones are left feeling bereaved, guilty, and uncertain. These emotions impact grief and often affect survivors in ways we have not yet begun to understand. Goodman's goal is to help us begin to change how we think about this topic and to transform our culture so we shift from not talking about dying to talking about it. Using this framework, the conversation becomes about how we want to live at the end of our lives. It will be a time to communicate about the kind of care and options we want and don't want for ourselves. This is a step commonly lost between the \"getting your affairs in order\" and \"funeral arrangements.\" Many people draw up a will with legal guidance, attempting to provide for property and distribution of goods. Often, people plan the details of their postdeath arrangements with great precision. Family and friends are instructed about burial sites, clothing choices, and even music for the services. These plans seem to help everyone feel that their loved one's wishes are intact. However, conversations about what you would like while still alive may be just beginning. To help you get started, the IHI Open School and The Conversation Project created a free, 4-lesson online course.2 A starter kit provides a useful guide.1 This online tool provides tools such as a writing exercise that begins with a \"What Matters\" statement. Participants may talk about or write a statement that begins with \"What matters to me…,\" later extending it to \"What matters to me at the end of my life….\" Short survey-type questions are offered to encourage people to choose care settings and quality-of-life issues. The kit includes legal and medical documents to write down your wishes so they can be honored when the time comes. In addition, the kit defines terms that are commonly used in the conversation such as: advance care planning: the process of thinking about your preferences for care at the end of life—exactly what you have been working on here. advance directive: the document that describes your preferences for care in case you are unable to make health care decisions on your own; it is also known as a living will. health care proxy: identifies your health care agent (often called a \"proxy\"), the person you trust to act on your behalf if you are unable to make health care decisions or communicate your wishes; in some states, this is called the durable power of attorney for health care; this is probably the most important document.3 Other documents and services offer similar tools. Five Wishes is a booklet introduced in 1997 and originally distributed with support from a grant by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. This tool lets your family and doctors know whom you want to make health care decisions for you when you can't make them, the kind of medical treatment you want or don't want, how comfortable you want to be, how you want people to treat you, and what you want your loved ones to know. Since 2011, the materials are available online, allowing people to complete Five Wishes on screen and print out a personalized document immediately.4 This year, as we gather family and friends for the holidays, invite a conversation about the future, a different future, one that you may not be able to control or predict, but one you want to discuss. Everyone will die. It is a certainty. Unfortunately, we, and many of our patients cannot choose when, where, or how we will die, but we may change some of the conditions and experiences that will surround that period. When I was young, my Aunt Isabelle once told me about the best way to go, the 3-day death: one day to let everyone know your going, another to let friends come to say goodbye, and the last one to be with your family. Sounded great to me. My earliest memories were of some of these deaths. I have remote memories of a steady stream of caring people, carrying hot meals and home-baked pies as they came to my grandparent's house. There were no hospital beds, oxygen tubes, or suction machines. It was actually nice, not frightening to me as a child and somewhat comforting. Next there would be rituals, an Irish double header; a wake consisting of afternoon and evening viewings at the funeral home, followed by a high mass the next morning. The details had all been discussed over the last days, as family and friends prepared for the inevitable. As an intensive care unit nurse, I soon realized that a simple death was a gift; not everyone would have an opportunity to be together with family, talking and sharing stories, often mending fences and sharing prayers. In the intensive care unit, people are often robbed of the things they want to say and do. They may not be able to be with the people they love most. We know that people want to say things, usually centered on love, forgiveness, or gratitude. Sounds simple, but often we lose the chance to say or hear what the people we love most want or need, because we have not had this conversation. People have concerns beyond simply prolonging their lives. Professional and lay publications and presentations commonly tell us that patients with terminal illness find that their top priorities include, to avoiding suffering, being with family, having the touch of others, being mentally aware, and not becoming a burden to others. Dr Atul Gawande tells us, \"Spending one's final days in an ICU because of terminal illness is for most people a kind of failure. You lie on a ventilator, your every organ shutting down, your mind teetering on delirium, and permanently beyond realizing that you will never leave this borrowed, fluorescent place. The end comes with no chance for you to have said goodbye or \"it's OK\" or \"I'm sorry\" or \"I love you.\"5 Often at the end of life for our loved ones, we are unsure of what to do, where to be. My friend Joe was close to his last days, battling renal cancer. His nephew asked when he should come to see him. Joe's answer was great! \"If he wants to see me, he can come anytime… if he wants me to see him… he better come now!\" Joe was able to talk to his family, be cared for in a setting of his choice, and determine when medical intervention should transition to palliative care. Enjoy the holidays. Begin the conversation. Kathleen Ahern Gould, PhD, RN Editor in Chief Dimensions of Critical Care Nursing Adjunct Faculty William F.

      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety-Fright, Guilt, And Shame are existential emotions because the threats on which they are based have to do with meanings and ideas about who we are, our place in the world, life and death, and the quality of our existence. We have constructed these meanings for ourselves out of our life experience and the values of the culture in which we live, and we are committed to preserving them. What is specifically threatened in each of these emotions differs. In anxiety-fright the meaning centers on our personal security, our identity as individuals, as well as on issues of life and death, while in guilt it is about our moral lapses, and in shame it is about our failure to live up to our own and others’ ideals.",

      "abstract": "In education, schools, homes, families, institutions throughout the country and the world, the individual must be neat, punctual, orderly, hardworking, and disciplined. In my work, I analyze the impact of clutter during creation. Throughout history, we have been convinced that chance often defines the entire future of humanity, and great discoveries have not always been associated with the amount of work and dedication invested. Children are prone to clutter, waste, and unrestrained play. Rules do not burden children, and their world is open to all. Children do not know what is possible and what is not and do not understand our stereotypes and regulations. Without rules and laws, society cannot function, but progress and progress into the future always take place when someone deviates from the pattern. All institutions strive for obedience and typification of ways of thinking, which often suffocates the inventive mind. A man who is not trapped by stereotypes finds inspiration and freedom of mind and creation in disorder. In a mess, anything is possible, as in the imagination. Before any discovery in any area of creativity, a â€œeurekaâ€ and a â€œclickâ€ must occur. Materializations thrive after idea and vision. The way to reach these solutions is often inexplicable and unexpected. It requires courage and departure from the rules and boundaries of time and society. People who run the world have the burden of fighting stereotypes. They are often unsupported, misunderstood, ridiculed, and marginalized. Their genius, their freedom is revealed either after death or by a combination of circumstances.",

People have been led to remember nonexistent events from the recent past as well as non-existent events from their childhood. They can be led to falsely believe that they have had familiar experiences, but also rather bizarre or implausible ones (e.g., that they witnessed demonic possession as a child). They can be led to believe that they did things that would have been impossible (e.g., that they shook hands with Bugs Bunny during a trip to Disneyland). They can also be led to falsely believe that they had experiences that would have been highly traumatic had they actually happened. False beliefs have consequences for people, affecting later thoughts and behaviors. People who are led to believe that as children they got sick eating particular foods show avoidance of those foods later on. People who are led to believe they had a bad experience with Pluto at Disney want to pay less for a Pluto souvenir.

Some women who spoke about the inevitability of death described their preferred scenario; they were Hoping to Leave This World Like That. Knowing other older female friends who had &amp;ldquo;suffered something worse than death,&amp;rdquo; some women were Hoping Not to Linger Like She Did. Some women have shared both of these wishes and concerns.

      "abstract": "Those who attempt scholarly works about laughter or humor often begin with an apology responding to one of two sorts of complaints. The first is that laughter is trivial, unimportant, associated with children and with momentary diversions from the more serious, important business of (adult) human life; therefore, it hardly seems worth serious scholarly investigation. The second is that, even if one grants the potential importance of studying laughter, one kills the joy in the subject matter by analyzing something so natural and spontaneous, perhaps akin to dissecting fish in an attempt to understand the way they swim in streams. I will not begin this book by making such apologies. The defenses they might generate, however, are worth noting. Briefly, for those who might wonder, the following assertions underlie this study of human laughter in interaction. In its ability to display affiliation, friendliness, or even intimacy, laughter plays an important role in the creation and maintenance of interpersonal relationships. It can also serve to mock, deride, and belittle others, when it is the laughter of cruelty and triumph. We laugh accompanying and responsive to all sorts of talk and actions: often but not always as a response to humor, but also when we feel nervous or simply when others are laughing. Laughter has been part of the human communicative repertoire for a very long time, probably even predating speech, and our higher primate cousins also enact behaviors that look and sound like laughter and serve similar purposes.",

      "title": "Four: Calladita, Te Ves Más Bonita: Analyzing Silences and Erasures",
      "abstract": "A certain sense of satisfaction seeps through me as I get ready for the city's next appointment. We are now getting into the thick of things and uncovering the roots of her troubles. The past is bubbling up into the present, something I can tell the city is reluctant to disclose too much about. When the office door closes, muting the sounds of street vendors, children rushing to school, and the occasional bank alarm, the silence seems to expand. I feel her wanting to delete, delete even as she speaks; she is hesitant, terrified even, to allow her past to fully emerge. It is easy for her (or anyone else) to open up these tunnels into the past that has been sealed for so long. I have many questions now; however, I have to be careful to listen more than probe at this juncture. Within the sanctuary that psychoanalysis creates, will she speak more of the unspeakable? Will she talk more about this past that she has so carefully erased? Or will she remain silent? Either way, both the answers and the absence of answers will be telling.The act of writing (a manuscript or a self) is full of editings and erasures, silences and absences. While the standard advice to writers is what you know, there are some things, of course, that we know all too intimately yet do wish to recall, much less make public by writing about them. The city is no exception. Calladita, te ves mas bonita is a popular saying usually used with children or, all too frequently, from husband to wife. It is translated as quiet, you look more beautiful. Your most pleasing appearance coincides with your silence - the city almost seems to take this as a personal mantra. That which is not-beautiful or ambivalent must be edited out, sloughed off the city surface and deleted from the city's conscious like the trash-ticket. Indeed, the uglier events and darker side of the city are rarely spoken about, and people reiterate the phrase aqui no pasa nada (here nothing happens) to a carnivalesque degree, despite the fact that everyone is aware of cases of government corruption, the ever-nearing presence of narco-violence, and so on.In the city's process of editing and reediting, what else gets taken out and made to not happen? As the city stays quiet and resists symbolizing what ails her, I examine some of the themes she chooses to write about. This process of reflection - of reading between the lines of text she creates - reveals more of the deradicalization, purification, and repression that emerged in the previous session. These erasures also unveil a new theme (not written about) that will spur further questions about what lies beneath the city's physical and psychic surface. The need to narrate through these darker areas becomes increasingly urgent. Is silence a dead end or a fertile beginning?ESTAS RUINAS QUE (NO) VES I THESE RUINS YOU DO (NOT) SEEOne text that the city reads on a regular basis is Estas ruinas que ves, by Guanajuato-born Jorge Ibarguengoitia. If Don Quijote provides the first emblematic character for the city's subjectivity, this novel, published in 1975 and winner of the Premio Internacional Novela Mexico, constitutes a more recent identity text, although, again, among the well-educated parts of the population. While the full text of the novel is posted on the city's surface, the novel itself is immersed in the details of the city's physiognomy. It names many local sites, albeit in pseudonymic form, that are easily identified. The entire novel is transparently disguised as taking place in a fictional setting called Cuevano, and local readers can pick out which cafe, which church, which house, and probably to some extent which event certain scenes refer to. Academics in particular make frequent reference only to the book, author, and later film but also to the characters and places in the text. The name Cuevano also appears as the name of a local bus line and is written on the sides of these busses, and people refer to themselves as cuevanenses, residents of this (semi) fictional site. …",

Especially when the dead person was not close, a funeral service and an ensuing trip to the graveyard are often meditative times, providing powerful signals about our own future, stimulating fear or bringing hidden fear to the surface. They create, all too often, a volatile emotional condition in which we may be susceptible to some of fear’s less savory neighbors, other painful emotions (anger, envy, disgust) that may pollute our relationship with others. But the reminder of a shared fate might also have more benign consequences (as Rousseau thought), encouraging a kind of egalitarian compassion, an awareness of a common human condition that transcends class and wealth and even religion, bringing people together.",

The mechanical aspects of quality are those things which are visible or tactile: cleanliness, completeness, adequate numbers, smiling faces, quickly answered phones. All of these may be visible and present in a unit which offers a poor quality service. Behind the smiling faces, the efficiently answered phone, may lie a philosophy of total self-centredness, a value system based on clock watching and working strictly within a job description.

One not uncommon reason for this failure is if the child is a replacement for another child who has died and the parents have not been able to do the grief work required in mourning. This task is often more problematic in the case of a stillbirth. Examples are given of other creative people, such as Freud and Dali, where a previous death in the family may have been the spur to their finding a special identity through their creativity.",

As soon as our thinking has found words it ceases to be sincere or at bottom serious. When it begins to exist for others it ceases to live in us, just as the child severs itself from its mother when it enters into its own existence.—Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms When one lives alone, one neither speaks too loud nor writes too loud, for one fears the hollow echo—the criticism of the nymph Echo. And all voices sound different in solitude!—Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science Dream has its own time. While one is dreaming one does not know this of course; that it will end. In dreaming one assumes it will go on indefinitely, as in living—a reasonable delusion based on life experience: life goes on indefinitely until one is dead. Only dreams end. And in this respect loves and plays and stories are like dreams: they end. Books were better than dreams or life. A book ended not like life, abruptly; not like a dream, with a clumsy struggle and sense of deception; but gracefully and knowingly, preparing you for the final period. Between life and dream there was not much difference really, however the two wrangled, struggled, played tricks on each other. A book was something really different…. You can be dreaming and not know it. You can be awake and wonder if it’s a dream and not believe it. But a book is simply and always a book—you can be sure of that. And with a book, whether you’re reading it or writing it, you are awake.—Susan Taubes, Divorcing",

      "title": "#MeToo",
      "abstract": "#MeToo Jennifer L. Airey With the advent of the #MeToo movement, I have been reflecting on my good fortune to have encountered only some of the good men who populate our profession. I have had male mentors my entire career, wonderful men who have supported me academically and professionally and who I do not believe would ever sexualize, demean, or harass their students. This is less a function of my people skills or my professionalism than of sheer luck. Too many of us live with the deeply ingrained sexist belief that if we present ourselves a certain way, speak a certain way, behave a certain way, we will insulate ourselves from sexual advances in the workplace. Too many of us, even those of us who fight victim-blaming attitudes and rape culture in our scholarship and our classrooms, are apt to default to self-blame when we find ourselves in uncomfortable or demeaning situations: if only I had not said—worn—laughed at—been alone with—etc. But, of course, none of us is ever truly safe, not in our private lives, where the majority of assaults are committed by people we know and trust, and not in the academy, where we believe that a general awareness of and interest in gender theory should make people more informed, more understanding, more \"woke,\" as my students would say. When the Harvey Weinstein story first broke in the media, it felt, at least to me, like an inevitability, a confirmation of something I had already known. I am an academic living in Tulsa, Oklahoma; I have no contacts in Hollywood beyond one semester in 1999 when a college friend interned with a production company and sometimes brought back juicy tidbits of celebrity gossip. But even I had heard stories about Weinstein, stories that I, a feminist academic who literally wrote a book about rape, mentally dismissed as the casting couch, the price of doing business in Hollywood. I shake my head in retrospect; how could I have ever thought that sexual harassment was a normal part of the quest for fame? The greatest success of the #MeToo movement has been, in my opinion, the defamiliarization of such stories, the act of forcing us to confront and name as Not Okay experiences that we previously shrugged off as an inevitable part of being a woman. I am fortunate never to have encountered a Harvey Weinstein of my own, but I have been subject to lesser violations (here I was about to write that I have never been \"seriously\" assaulted, but what a problematic thing to say, how indicative of our cultural sickness that it is a relief to have been violated only a little bit): by the DMV employee who administered my driving test with his hand on my thigh when I was sixteen, the man who slapped my backside on the streets of Paris when I was seventeen, [End Page 7] the man who grabbed my crotch in a club when I was twenty-two, the man who gripped my arm in an elevator, laughed, and called me a bitch when I was a thirty-five-year-old tenured academic. I used to shrug off such experiences—\"well, it could have been worse\" or \"at least it will make a good story later\" or \"I should have known better than to get on the elevator with him\"—this from a woman who routinely teaches women's and gender studies and knows more than most about cultural conceptions of rape. But #MeToo has burned away those dismissals, leaving behind, for me as for so many of us, a deep anger at the culture in which we live. More recently, the #MeToo movement has hit home, transcending Hollywood and forcing us to look to our own academic backyard. In November 2017, Seo-Young Chu, now an Associate Professor at Queens College, CUNY, published a powerful, brave essay, \"A Refuge for Jae-In Doe: Fugues in the Key of English Major,\" in which she detailed coercion, harassment, and rape at the hands of her advisor, the late Jay Fliegelman: The story begins with my suicide attempt at age 21 and ends with Stanford's own...",

      "title": "Shadow Self: Bringing White Supremacy Into the Light",
      "abstract": "It happens all the time.I'm chatting with a friend, or in a meeting, or teaching, and I feel the whiteness within me stretch and grow hungry. It's this inexplicable need to take up space. Sometimes I can't swallow it down and it comes flooding out in \"I\" statements and \"oh my gosh I know what you mean's\" or \"yeah, that's awful, I'm impacted too's.\" I see it bubbling up within others, too, when discussions of racism and statements of anger or hurt from People of Color become quickly submerged under the white guilt, the white rage, the white tears.I didn't always know it was whiteness. I used to think it was just me. My right to engage and be seen. I thought all people deserved to be heard and valued, and that offering my own feelings into a space was just a good way to be cared for. Even when my speaking was to decry the racism and whiteness within me, I could leave vindicated. Even the discomfort felt good, because it was validated.I devoted myself to reading more about race and whiteness. The first book I chose, White Fragility, was written by a white woman (DiAngelo, 2018). As I read through it, it felt like a punch to the gut. There was a quote early on regarding how white progressives do the most harm to People of Color. I saw myself in those words. White progressive. The \"good\" one. I later learned that other Black authors expressed similar ideas long before they were packaged for me by a white woman (Helms, 1990; King, 1994). I still deeply value her book, but it took so much whitewashing for the message to reach me.I was committed. I was going to open my eyes and see things for how they were. I was not going to be performative to the detriment of my colleagues, friends, and clients. I was going to be better than a progressive white person. Better. Better. Better. Me. Me. Me.I had the language and the sincere motivations that helped People of Color trust me. I watched as the whiteness within me slid past, unannounced, catching me unaware. I saw the realization in their eyes when they first got confirmation that I wasn't as different as I pretended to be. In each of those moments, my first instinctual reaction was to think, \"I'm working so hard! None of my effort is seen!\" Me. Me. Me. Where did my students, colleagues, clients, and friends have to take their wounds while I remained lost in my guilt and pride?Over and over, I scolded my whiteness and began again. An endless dance to starve something that is so persistently hungry.I began to notice the patterns of white-centeredness in dialogues. It's always easier to see something in someone else before you can see it in yourself. Even the most fervent allies somehow still filled the space. Always, the white people were the ones doing the talking. I saw the frustration of the Black people in my life. They fought for space. They took the risk to say, \"Here is my pain,\" and they received \"Thank you for sharing, that was so impactful for me.\" There was no packaging up and caring for the voices most in need. Somehow it all circled back to white reactions. White voices. White space.Unpacking it in myself is even harder. I have some incredibly patient people of color in my life. I am trying to catch that yawning, waking whiteness within. There is a concept in counseling and psychology called the shadow self. It is the idea that the ugly, unacceptable things within each of us that we stuff down deep inside are the same things that spill over through our subconscious actions. The harder we stuff, the stronger they flood out. This is how I am coming to view whiteness (Reeves, 2000).The thing about the shadow self, though, is that if you take it out and examine it fully, and find a way to integrate it within yourself, it can become part of you in a way that is not destructive. These shadowy and unacceptable parts can be channeled for good. But it means doing the work of honest examination and coming to terms with the fact that they are a part of you.In Janet Helms's (1990) theory of white racial identity, she states that part of developing as a white person is finding and integrating a positive white identity. This does not mean loving the ugliness of white supremacy, but rather taking the inner whiteness out of the shadows and engaging with it. Resmaa Menakem (2017) also offers a powerful framework for tuning into and releasing the white supremacy deeply rooted in white bodies. The work lies in knowing why whiteness hungers so much to be seen and to take space, and understanding how it wounds, even when exercised through the arms and words of those of us with the \"best of intentions.\"Until white counselors can do this work, our clients of color will carry the burden of searching for light within our shadows. My hope is to pull my whiteness into the light, so that by knowing it and seeing it more clearly, I can learn to tame it. I invite other white counselors to take this journey with me. Begin with the texts cited here. Tune into the insatiable ways whiteness impacts your sense of self and your relationships. Notice how this shadow self impacts your ability to truly hear and connect with your clients, particularly those who are people of color. Maybe it will become second nature to stop with the \"I think …\" or \"I feel …\" at the tip of our tongues, and to look in the eyes of the Black people and other people of color in our lives to say \"I see you.\"",

      "title": "Understanding the misfit",
      "abstract": "I am an optimist and one of the most difficult aspects of my work in clinical psychiatry has been the number of people I see who do not seem to want to be helped. Their problems are obvious, solutions are clear, but the ability or will to find them is lacking. For whether by accident or through subterfuge of my other facilities, I have come to a differing interpretation that retains my optimism. It is that many people who are, in current parlance, “treatment-resistant” or “treatment-resisting”, are not so at all. They want to keep the essence of their personae, both assets and handicaps, and instead of change just want to feel more at home in the world in their own skins, not in a new one fashioned by others. This approach, which I call nidotherapy, is illustrated by this evocative novel by Tim Pears. The central character of Landed, Owen, is like so many of the dispossessed and homeless people I have seen in central London over the past 20 years. He is alcohol dependent and has had an acrimonious divorce that limits his access to his children. A car accident led to the death of his daughter and the loss of his right hand (from which he gets phantom limb pain); he is unemployed—if not unemployable. Owen does not seek psychiatric help, or indeed medical help of any sort, even though he is suicidal at times, because he does not see the point. He would expect to be told to stop drinking, to be more reasonable with the social workers who control access to his children, and asked to take treatment for depression, the state that seems to underlie many of his symptoms but that is almost certainly only a consequence. When he decides to abduct his children with no intention of returning them to their mother, he is behaving just like the antisocial psychopath we might have predicted, and before long will find himself in prison where he belongs. Pears paints a completely different picture. Owen has been well adjusted in the past when he grew up with his grandparents on a hill farm in Wales, learnt to know the comings and goings of the seasons for all the denizens of the countryside, both wild and tamed, and achieved a peace he had never experienced either before or since. The fact that subsequently he went to an alien environment, that of suburban Birmingham which could not be further removed from the Welsh hills, and did not fit in, would not have been detected by most health professionals, no matter how sophisticated and patient they were with Owen. He comes over as a deep feeling but largely inarticulate man who is capable of strong relationships but finds the life of an urban society totally alien. So when he abducts his children he is not engaged in spiteful revenge against his wife, but in taking them on a long journey back to the hills of his youth where he hopes he can find his bearings. He wants to show his children exactly what person he is—not an alcoholic layabout, but a resourceful countryman who can live off the land, catch rabbits, find shelter against the elements, and provide some comfort for his children despite the frequent inclemency of the elements. Milan Kundera wrote that the wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything, and Pears offers many of these for the reader to muse about in his book. But one resounds throughout the book, “why do we so often assume that misfits are perverse in failing to follow a logical way out of their difficulties?” Where Pears excels is in his ability to show that his main characters are far from stereotypical oddities with different belief systems from the rest of humanity, and that each has excellent reasons for doing as they do. He breathes warmth and dignity into Owen's monosyllabic angry grunting grandfather, who after failing with his son's upbringing, tries again with his grandson, showing him the woods and meadows as together they imitate bird calls, split logs, round up sheep, and look for a lost ewe in the snow. Pears gets the reader to share the puzzlement of Owen's wife, Mel, brought up in the suburbs of Birmingham, who is first attracted to the man in the pub “with no sense of fashion but who took pride in his appearance”. Later, after his accident, she loses contact with the man she once loved; “you don't know what lonely is till you're sharing your house with a ghost”. So she divorces him without properly understanding who he was and why he has lost his way. There are no easy messages in this book. It is an elegy of our times, a story of acceptance and loss leading to a Ulyssean journey to recapture the certainties and happiness of youth, and which ends without Owen finding Ithaca or his Penelope. But this story does not make me pessimistic. This novel promotes my belief that what we need more than ever now in the caring professions is the recognition and respect of diversity. In an age in danger of being stifled by bland conformity when we too often assume the particular is at variance with the needs of the throng, we must learn to be sensitive to the needs of those who are different but far from alien.",

Only in our fantasies are we anywhere near free to indulge our dramatic imaginings to their fullest; even then we are not entirely free, for we must dream within the historic experience of our life stories. In life, we are thrust into a work-in-progress. It is a sprawling performance that has countless acts and a profusion of scenes, often being performed simultaneously and repeatedly. Reality becomes congruent with these enactments of the habitual stories and stock tales of the community. To the extent that we get to write and enact our own lives, we must begin with and respond to the dramatic plot in which we find ourselves. The story of my life can never be disentangled from the community's story, in which my story develops and gains significance.

      "abstract": "Some inner-city youth have ducked bullet and built hope through their participation in neighborhood-based organizations that offer safety, support, guidance, companionship, opportunities for growth, and engagement. IN THE WORDS of one youth worker, daily goal of many young people in our nation's inner cities is to live, to duck bullet.(1) For these youth, seemingly simple task of making it through adolescence is a challenge. Success for them comes from surviving everyday urban threats to their future -- literal and figurative bullets of drugs, violence, crime, pregnancy, abuse, and neglect. Many inner-city youth express a hopeless view of their future, and their voices embody life in inner city for many who live inside and outside its borders: don't plan your future; you just take it as it comes. Life's a constant struggle 'cuz you can't count on anything. You don't know for sure what's even gonna happen next day. You could get shot walkin' down street.(2) get more respect for carryin' a Uzi than you do for goin' to school. Ain't nobody gonna cheer you on with 'I hope you do well, go to college.' Lyin' by, gettin' high, drinkin' beer, smokin' weed. Yeah, boy, that's our future. future be dead. Such despair no longer startles or surprises many Americans, for they, too, have lost hope for inner-city youth. When middle-class Americans hear that, by some estimates, more than one-quarter of U.S. young people confront a serious of never reaching productive maturity and that another one-quarter are at moderate risk,(3) they understand where despair comes from. When they hear that between 60% and 80% of today's young people judged seriously at risk live in this nation's inner cities and are unlikely to achieve healthy, constructive adulthood. they may well despair themselves.(4) Yet, despite all somber evidence, there are voices of hope -- hope among some special adults who work in organizations that support inner-city youth and hope among youth themselves: [People in this organization] push me to stay in there and work harder. They know I can go all way; I know I can go all way. It's just a choice of me doin' it, I'm gonna get there. I've decided in my mind that I can match anybody. . . . If you're smart and everything or you're tryin' to make somethin' out of yourself and you live in projects, that's good . . . because then you can encourage other people who live in bad neighborhoods. The [youth organization] is an opportunity to become people here, they'll help you become what you wanna become. They trust me. It makes me feel good. People here care, and I can become something. In many respects, these young people, whom we came to call the hopefuls, are no different from their peers. Every day they confront same vortex of gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty. Many contend with turbulent families, deficient and impersonal schools, and communities that seem to care little about them. Their interact ions with such helping institutions as service agencies or local police are often inadequate or degrading. What distinguishes hopefuls from other youth engaged in inner-city survival is their active involvement in some kind of neighborhood youth organization. These young people have ducked bullet and built hope through their participation in neighborhood-based organizations that offer safely, support, guidance, companionship, opportunities for growth, and engagement. Urban Sanctuaries Inner-city youth have a lot of time on their hands. For adolescents who are in school, some 40% of their waking hours are uncommitted.(5) When school doors shut behind them in early afternoon, these young people are often claimed by streets. For those not in school, free time hangs even heavier. In neighborhoods where recreational facilities are run-down and ill-equipped, parks become urban battlegrounds, shops and other commercial hangouts have closed one by one, and jobs are practically nonexistent. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract The need to understand human social life is basic to human nature and fuels a lifelong quest that began in early childhood. Key is trying to fathom people’s inner mental states—their hopes, plans, wants, thoughts, and emotions. Scientists call this developing a “theory of mind,” and Reading Minds tells the story of our journey to that understanding. Each of us step by step creates a wide-ranging theory of mind used to understand how people work. Failure to learn these steps cripples a child, and ultimately an adult, in areas as diverse as interacting socially, creating a coherent life story, enjoying drama and movies, and living on one’s own. An understanding of these steps allows us to see our shared humanity, to understand our children and our childhood selves, to teach and to learn from others, and to better navigate and make sense of our social world. Theory of mind is basic to why some become religious believers and others atheists, some become novelists and all of us love stories, why some love scary movies and some hate them. Reading Minds shows how theory of mind develops as children and how that defines us as individuals and highlights us as human. Written by a scientist—himself a parent and a grandparent—who pioneered much of the research in this field, Reading Minds fuses insider science with everyday life to cement a whole new view of ourselves, our children, and the mysteries of our social minds.",

It is of course good to be held to account by the question that circulates through so much of our belletristic literatures (as in, for instance, Edward St Aubyn's Bad News): How can one think one's way out of a problem, when the problem is the way one thinks? Yet an extra layer of diagnosis need not result in anything beyond itself. I can easily glimpse the chiaroscuro of another mind and thus know of the limits of my knowledge of its furnishings without knowing what they (the limits or the furnishings) are, or even whether the clarity is meant to be hidden by, more than hide, the dimness. But is inner presentation/apprehension of one's own self-portrait any more diamantine, any less naive, in its “obviousness”?

Everyone else has an opinion on the change in his behaviour. His teacher thinks he is being lazy and can't be bothered to finish his work, his mum thinks he is moody and bad tempered, his friends think he is no fun any more and turning into a bore. Comments like, 'Cheer up it might never happen', ' What has got into you?' and 'Do you want to talk about it?' just upset him even more. He doesn't know what the 'it' is, that is making him feel this way. He didn't even feel this bad when his cousin died a year ago! When he is kept behind in class for not completing his work he tells the teacher how confused and sad he feels. Connections are made between his feelings and the looming anniversary of his cousin's death. Sam is helped to understand that thoughts and feelings associated with bereavement can come and go for a long time, and can cause strong emotions. He is shown how to notice and share his feelings and to think about things he can do when he feels this way. He makes a memory box so he can also remember all the happy things about his cousin. In the 'Let's talk about .sadness and loss,' section, feelings associated with bereavement and helpful coping strategies are shared. Paul Nagel has worked as an educational psychologist for 17 years.

      "title": "How do we measure childhood?",
      "abstract": "Childhood and adolescence are ideally about being loved and recognised and being given time to discover, play, learn and master new skills and abilities over and over again. Frustration leads to children discovering that they can create their own playgrounds and this actually prepares them for taking responsibility for their lives as they grow. What kind of adults do we want? Passive people, waiting to be told what to do or actively creating the future? I recall that when one of my children saw the first Harry Potter film, having read the book, he exclaimed ‘Oh, is that what Privet Drive looks like?’. It made me realise that he had created his own vision of what Harry's family home – 4 Privet Drive – looked like while reading, something that I believe would not have happened if he seen the movie first. Fantasy and imagination are crucial to a child, as are learning, and finding comfort in the fact that they can master the creative process and that boredom and frustration can be channelled into doing something new and creative. This process takes time and can be challenging to watch, but parents have to be patient and confident that the child has the abilities they need to do this and not interfere. It is enough to stay close and not to offer them screen gadgets such as TVs, computers, tablets and smartphones. And parents should not hide behind a screen themselves! Over the last 10–15 years, our leisure time seems to have become more and more occupied by screens and gadgets of all kinds. Even very young children spend a considerable amount of time in front of screens. It is quite often an easy way out for parents, as the child is quiet, stays still and satisfied for the time being and does not complain. But the child does not complain, because it does not know what it is missing out on. The impact of screens, and the time they take from children and adolescents, has been discussed in studies 1, 2. The effects of inactivity and changed behaviour are easy to understand and measure in conditions such as children being overweight or having cardiovascular disease or diabetes. All this is enough to take action and aim for less screen time. But how, and when, can we measure the impact of excessive screen time on childhood? And how much is excessive screen time? Are these relevant questions? I believe they are. Of course, older children, above the age of four or five, can play on screens, assuming they are given age-appropriate games or programmes. Older children can, of course, also learn and gain knowledge via screens, and screens have become an important tool in school. Children with certain disabilities also find that screens can be of great help, both in school and in enabling them to achieve a better quality of life. However, this does not directly suggest that children should spend unlimited hours in front of a screen. It is important to remember that, in general, children do not need screens at all. It is very unlikely that anything a small child learns on a screen today will be relevant when it is old enough to actually use the screen or computer in school or at work. Thus, the argument that children need to learn about computers and the Internet at an early age is, in my opinion, not true. On the other hand, there is much that a child needs to learn while growing, such as communication and language, walking, running, balancing, interacting with others and getting feedback in a real social context. These are things that cannot be learnt on a screen and things that need to be practised in order to be learnt during childhood. Screen skills can, in contrast, be learnt at any time later in life. Another issue about screens is how parents frequently bury their faces in smartphones or other screens, often in combination with headphones, which prevents communication with a baby or child that needs continuous feedback from their parent or inhibits the adult's responses to the curious and talkative preschool child. And those are just two examples. When boys in a thesis study were asked what they would do without a computer, they said they would probably be outdoors more 3. The author summarised that the ‘computer is pizza, outdoor is spinach’. Catchy and maybe true, but children eat what adults serve them and it is the adult's responsibility to make it appetising. Adults have to be ready to present alternatives to screens. An active lifestyle is good for children, as well as for adults, and lifestyle is something we learn from our parents. From this perspective, the study by Chiu et al. 4, which is published in this issue of Acta Paediatrica, is interesting. Children do as parents do. Thus, adults have to take the responsibility for ensuring that children are given time and space in society. It is a child's right! Then, if their leisure time is divided between physical activities, friends, play and other activities such as reading, painting and screens, that is, of course, neither dangerous nor bad. How much time in front of a screen is OK? To begin with, we can apply the recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics 1, as that is a good start. But the truth is that we actually do not know. The only sensible thing to do is be to be careful of overexposing children to screens, especially smaller children. Still, we, as professionals, silently accept that children are exposed to screens much more than we understand is good for them, based on what we see in everyday practice, namely increasing problems of overweight, stress, abdominal pains, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleeping problems and psychiatric problems 1, 2. So what can we do? There are no clear or easy answers. Research, information, recommendations and communication of a clear professional opinion are probably the ways to go and they are our responsibility. Start with the person in the mirror. Remember, childhood can never be set on replay.",

      "abstract": "]f) ELIGIOUS IS ONE OF THE LAST ADJECTIVES one would ordinarily JiMuse to describe Robert Frost's poetry. The individual self, which is its central reality, feels completely cut off from any divine reality beyond its own spiritual elements of love, courage, and creativity. Yet the speaker in the poetry keeps alive the possibility that something greater than man sustains order and purpose in the universe and may sometime break through man's isolation to reveal itself. It may even alleviate his inner uncertainty and fear about his final destiny. The terms in which the question is raised are strongly influenced by Judaeo-Christian assumptions. Yet any self-transcending leap of faith toward such a possibility seems too great a risk when even to stand firm in self-possession requires heroic efforts against the onslaughts of time, nature, and the dehumanizing chaos of modern society. Easy religious assurances, like other palliatives for man's deepest fears and woes, are a dangerous temptation to disarm himself of his own resources of patience and courage. Frost's response to all threats to human identity is Give us immedicable woes. ...And then to play. The play's the thing. Play's the thing. All virtue in 'as if.'1 Frost's play with religious matters is a deliberate enactment of doubtful searching, hopes, and fears in poetic forms that control and distance them, often with humor. Mastery over this form is a kind of mastery over impulses either to reject religion absolutely or to commit oneself to it. Thus the poet can explore by manipulating an ambiguous theme, create forms for selfprotection and selfasserdon, and finally make his own kind of salvation.",

You would bugger anyone if it gave you what you want. Imagine that these remarks are suddenly uttered by refined-looking woman of advanced years in the midst of medical consultation designed to assess whether she has Alzheimer Disease. She had been digressing into series of reminiscences about her marriage and her life, and she spits out these words as an aside to her husband. Alzheimer Disease is often associated with paranoia, contrariness, and waywardness of thought, and it is in that context that this kind of remark often occurs. These symptoms can take the form of apparently out-of-character attacks on those nearest and dearest to the patient. Understandably, they can be deeply distressing to the target, who worries that they have been thought or felt before and have just never been expressed. Once the cognitive impairment reveals them, doubts about the relationship are hard to resist. But are those doubts appropriate? Are the aggressive remarks of person with dementia expressions of his or her real feelings that we now see because polite veneer has been stripped away, or are they an effect of the disease? If one opts for the latter view, then are they merely random thoughts that the person would not normally entertain and would indeed strongly disapprove of?. The question is difficult because of the gradual and subtle alteration in the self that is often seen in Alzheimer Disease. Those who are close to the patient often make allowances for this, looking through the changes to the person who seems to lie intact as the problem becomes more evident. Yet remarks such as these can put severe strain on that attitude. The problem puts life story in question. As the person loses her grip on herself and her life story starts to break up, what should we make of glimpsed elements that seem alien to it? Things began to happen that I just couldn't understand. There were times I addressed friends by the wrong name. Comprehending conversations seemed quite impossible. My attention span became quite short. Notes were needed to remind me of things to be done and how to do them. I would slur my speech, use inappropriate words, or simply eliminate one from sentence. This caused me not only frustration but embarrassment. Then came the times I honestly could not remember how to plan meal or shop for groceries. (1) This passage is graphic illustration of the fragmentation of coherent self and the crippling of those cognitive skills that most of us unthinkingly rely on to organize our life narratives. These life narratives form a basis for talk and action, point of departure for telling stories about experience, and for rendering those stories intelligible, and we use our narratives as the basis for our relationships and projects. (2) Understanding the skills involved in being who I am and holding my story together is the key to knowing what to make of this woman's aside to her husband. In Vino Veritas and the Civilized Veneer On one side of this problem we are persuaded by the popular idea that disinhibition allows person to express side that would normally be kept well hidden. The civilized veneer is stripped away; one acts in vino veritas. According to this image of the self, each of us has both an authentic self and more polite and socialized presentation self, the latter kind of mask or cloak that conceals, to some extent, who one really is. Like much of popular psychology, this image is the product of noble savage romanticism combined with elements of Freudianism. (3) The civilized veneer, we could say, belongs to view of humanity promulgated in the era of colonial expansion and the valorization of empire. …",

      "abstract": "The absence of equilibrium implies the presence of tensions; there are tensions in the life of everyone, but nowhere more so than in the life of those who are trying to live up to an ideal. Experience has proved this to be true. But it is the more true of the Christian, continually responding to the urge of grace or failing to do so. Even the great Apostle of the Gentiles was forced to admit that ‘praiseworthy intentions are always ready to hand, but I cannot find my way to the performance of them. It is not the good my will prefers, but the evil my will disapproves, that I find myself doing.’ Yet such tensions can be an asset, provided we are clear about our goals. We cannot hope to eliminate tensions—trying to suppress or ignore them can only lead to worse effects—because they are due to our human nature wounded by the sin of our first parents. But we can hope to arrive at a state of harmony, a balance of tensions which will sustain us and even carry us forward. Again it is even more true of the social worker whose function is, by definition, ‘to assess the disturbance of equilibrium in a given handicapped person, in his family, his social relationships, so as to give appropriate help.’ In order to do his job properly, the social worker has to place himself in a situation that is lacking equilibrium, and through empathy to share—at least to some extent—the client’s problems. The social worker is not to be considered as a person safe and dry who throws a lifebelt to somebody struggling in the water. He has himself to jump in the water and to encourage the person in difficulties to make the necessary strokes to remain afloat, and perhaps eventually to make for the shore.",

He fixes liability to others for his failure. He enjoys blaming others and thereby keeps him free and fair. But a wise person seldom finds faults with others. He knows that if a man wants to shine in life, he neither should find fault with others nor should he show any excuse, rather he must be honest, sincere and always find fault with himself. So, he discovers his shortcomings, rectifies those and follows the right track accordingly to attain the perfection. He who shows excuse can never shine in life. Through excuse a shrewd person can cross a short distance but long journey is next to impossible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As I grow silent and make my consciousness quiet, in keeping with an interior context of self-transformation, I become aware of a simple phenomenon that I’ve always known yet rarely attended to. My inner world is made up of an ongoing conversation that I continuously carry on with myself. Within myself, I talk to myself in fairly ongoing and continuous ways (just as I dream to myself while sleeping). Through this little phenomenological experiment, I discover that I do indeed hear (or more accurately, feel or sense) voices, at times one and at times a multiplicity of voices within myself-that is, within my self. Often I am a monologue, sometimes a dialogue, sometimes more. At times, these voices address one another as “I” and “you,” but at other times “I” and “I” seems more the case as they agree, contest, interpolate, laugh at, comment on, and cry with one another. They may flow together into a single voice or, indeed, different voices resonating through a variety of registers of self-engagement.1",

      "abstract": "Among tering button my office the the with paraphernalia is top bright an of oversize a bookcase red letters lapel clutin tering the top of a bookcase in my office is an oversize lapel button with bright ed letters bearing the message: Enjoy Life! This is a dress rehearsal. Someone on the AWWA Research Foundation staff gave it to me when I took on this job almost three years ago. That message has helped me keep things in balance, no matter which way the winds may shift. Think about it. How many of your friends and associates seem to be enjoying life? How many of the people you encounter in stores and passing business matters appear to be happy? More often than not, the answer is not many. As the button implies, this is it. We get one shot at life, yet many of us pass through in a blur of job responsibilities, chores, and trivial matters. We live on the surface of life, doing what we must, coping as best we can, falling just short of being on top of things and able to enjoy ourselves. The demands of working, raising a family, and attending to weekend obligations and other extracurricular demands are truly difficult today. I doubt, however, that life is actually as difficult as it used to be, before all our modern conveniences were at handbefore today's standard of living was even dreamt about. Nevertheless, we experience contemporary life as highly stressful and so busy that we rarely have more than an occasional, brief chance to live as we would really like to. We are in control of our own lives; life's daily demands are in control of us",

It is clear that the bereaved person often experiences a devastating feeling of emptiness, as if his entire emotional investment has suddenly been cut off and is no longer available. The most effective way for the bereaved to be refilled with this lost essential is by frequently talking to someone close (the physician, a good friend, or a relative) about all the shared experiences, positive and negative, he had had with the deceased in past years. It is thereby possible to retrieve slowly all the emotional energy that had been placed in the person who has just died. The feeling of emptiness gradually lessens and new emotional investments eventually become possible.",

      "title": "Learning to Be Human: An Interview with William Pope.L",
      "abstract": "Everyone has to before they walk. Even so, it is also true that when people achieve a certain status, they may feel they are more important than another person. The rich look down on the poor. The beautiful look down on the plain. The powerful look down on the weak. But status is fleeting, we all begin on the same level with the same luck. Crawling brings us back to basics. We crawl, as small children, not because we are humiliated but because we are learning to be human. Crawling is a way to remind ourselves of our common struggle to be human. --Statement for Bringing the Decarie to the Mountain It was motherhood that initiated my struggle to be human. Pathetic as it is to admit, it wasn't until I was enraptured with the helpless person I held in my postpartum arms that I truly understood what it meant to walk in another's shoes. The simplest things seemed monumental to my son, like trying to lift his weak neck from the pillow or line up a piece of toast with his lips. Crawling seemed colossal, and I wept when he finally reached the couch. Perhaps this arrival at compassion, delayed as it may have been, is what ultimately brought me to the work of performance artist William Pope.L. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] The first photograph that I saw of Pope.L showed him inching along a city street, belly barely off the ground, clad in a soiled Superman suit. His glasses were skewed; he wore kneepads with holes, a skateboard strapped to his back, and a determined but drained look upon his face. By that time, the baby who taught me empathy was enamored of his own equally threadbare superhero costumes, and I was as taken with the image for sentimental reasons as I was piqued by its impetus. As I began to research Pope.L's work, which spans at least twenty years, I was most struck by these as he referred to them, performance pieces in which he took to the streets in the name of, and in support for, those who lived upon them. By literally crawling, his face centimeters from the cement and at one with the detritus and dirt, Pope.L became a visible bodily metaphor for the struggles that the homeless and disabled endure on a daily basis. Since the late 1970s, Pope.L has completed dozens of crawls in many countries, as well as countless performance pieces, nearly all of which ask viewers to reconsider their socially ingrained presumptions about class, race, and by extension, privilege. He routinely has a camera person with him to record reactions of passersby, which range from vociferous protest to nervous dismissal. His most critically acclaimed to date, The Great White Way (GWW), is a continual work-in-progress in which Pope.L plans to journey from the Statue of Liberty more than twenty miles uptown. As he is only able to complete the laborious segments intermittently, it is estimated that it will take over seven years to finish. Obviously it is a journey far more epic than my son's trek across the living room. Nevertheless, viewing images of a bedraggled Pope.L in his blue and red suit, resting on a sidewalk after one of his more grueling crawls, I cried again. In an age of overly cerebral, self-obsessional artwork that is difficult to decode (even if one wished to), here was an honest act of selfless symbolism. I wondered, whose work was truly difficult?; whom was I seeing, not just in the art world but in real life? And finally, in an age of inflated celebrity gods, who were my real heroes? These questions compelled me to introduce Pope.L's work to my students, and his work became the mainstay of our discussions on contemporary art's potential to change lives, as well as a way into discussing such unfashionable concepts as charity and poverty. But seeing art in reproduction pales in comparison to engaging with it, so when I heard that the artist would be organizing a mass crawl up the slope of Montreal's Mont Royal this past June, I took part. The performance, titled Bringing the Decarie to the Mountain, was part of the Decarie, a community-based exhibition project organized by the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts. …",

People must appreciate the many blessings they hold dear to whether they are family, friends, time, passions, communities, homes, and ability to feed and clothe ourselves. Oddly enough, money has been blamed as an appreciation killer. Amidst all the struggles and hardships, people see new trends in how people want to interact with businesses. They see a rise in independent businesses here in the United States. The combination of these, a shift in interaction and a rise of independent entrepreneurs, is prime groundwork for the Awakened Millionaire. The world is ever changing, ever evolving. Change in inevitable, and the Awakened Millionaire adapts. Awakened Millionaires must bring solutions to the world. To do that, they must channel their own self reliance to seize the opportunity already waiting for them.",

Geriatrics is an oddly ill-defined specialty when you look at it more carefully. Some of us practice medicine, some of us practice in the social sciences, and many of us simply do our jobs day-to-day and try to get by. What we share, however, is the heart of geriatrics: not simply a willingness, but a passion to help others who are aging. Nor is it simply “aging” in the chronological sense, but rather it is what happens as we age. It is what distinguishes the young newly-adult from the aging older-adult. In keeping with this distinction, our passion is not directed at aging as chronology, but at aging as suffering, fear, pain, disability, and the myriad other problems that arise with increasing frequency as the years grow longer.
