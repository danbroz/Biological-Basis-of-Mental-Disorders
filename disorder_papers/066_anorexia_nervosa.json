      "abstract": "This study of self‐esteem, body size, and parental views in 9–11–year‐old blind children found positive views about self‐presentation with no sex or weight differences. Lower self‐esteem emerged in children who thought they were judged by parents as too thin but being fat. being appraised as fat, or believing they are thought of as fat by parents, showed mi effect on self‐esteem. Their responses to questions about the causes, characteristics, and psychosocial functioning of obesity suggest an innate desire and possible need for a more robust stature, a bigger presence, and a feeling of weight which appeared to supercede any acquired negative attitudes to fatness.",

      "title": "Females with anorexia nervosa in Singapore",
      "abstract": "[Extract] Pressure to be thin can be exerted by various sources both external and internal. Sociocultural pressures include the showcase of gracile models and advertisements for diet products and slimming programmes in magazines and on television, criticisms about weight or shape, encouragement to diet, and role-modelling of eating habits within families, as well as overt approbation of skinny models or celebrities and comparison of appearance among peers, and teasing. Drive for thinness, which is conceptualised as the assimilation of societal standards of beauty and attractiveness into one’s belief system, is one of the core features of anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa includes a restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight; an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat even though at a significantly low weight; and disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. \r\n\r\nEarly findings in Asia documented patterns in eating disturbance that differed from Western-based symptom patterns, though subsequent studies indicated that anorexia nervosa in Asia is gradually becoming more similar to Western societies. It has been argued that Eastern values, such as collectivism, are protective against eating disorders. \r\n\r\nSingapore is a multicultural society strongly influenced by globalisation, where Western culture is widely embraced, especially by the younger generations. We wanted first, to compare a sample of females with anorexia nervosa in Singapore with international samples in terms of the risk factors related to anorexia nervosa, severity of eating pathology and levels of psychosocial impairment. Second, we wanted to explore the relationships between anorexia nervosa risk factors and adherence to Asian cultural values.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence, the time of life when people are changing and maturing between childhood and maturity. Adolescents are defined by the World Health Organization as those between the ages of 10 and 19. However, adolescence is sometimes incorrectly and narrowly associated with puberty and the physical changes that lead to reproductive maturity in many civilizations. Adolescence is not only associated with physical changes but also with developmental shifts in the individual's mind, social life, and moral code in certain cultures. The term \"adolescence\" is essentially equal to \"teens\" in these cultures, referring to the time between the ages of 12 and 20. Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disorder characterized by self-starvation and medically low body weight. Research indicates that anorexia nervosa develops through complex interaction among social, psychological and biological risk factors. Anorexia nervosa is most common in adolescent girls and young women but affects other age groups and genders. Maximum girls fearing of gaining weight and distorted perception of weight.",

      "title": "Expected and Desirable Preterm and Small Infant Growth Patterns",
      "abstract": "Adequate nutrition is necessary for achieving optimal growth and neurodevelopment. Growth is a natural and expected process that happens concomitantly with rapid advancements in neurodevelopment. Serial weight, length, and head circumference growth measures are essential for monitoring development, although identifying pathological deviations from normal growth can pose challenges. Appropriate growth assessments require considerations that a range of sizes for length, head circumference, and weight are expected and appropriate. Because of genetic differences and morbidities, there is a considerable overlap between the growth of healthy infants and those with growth alterations. Parents tend to be over-concerned about children who plot low on growth charts and often need reassurance. Thus, the use of terms such as \"poor\" growth or growth \"failure\" are discouraged when growth is approximately parallel to growth chart curves even if their size is smaller than specific percentiles. No specific percentile should be set as a growth goal; individual variability should be expected. An infant's size at birth is important information that goes beyond the common use of prognostic predictions of appropriate compared with small or large for gestational age. The lower the birthweight, the lower the nutrient stores and the more important the need for nutrition support. Compared to term infants, preterm infants at term-equivalent age have a higher percentage of body fat, but this diminishes over the next months. Current research findings support expert recommendations that preterm infants should grow, after early postnatal weight loss, similar to the fetus and then term-born infants, which translates to growth approximately parallel to growth chart curves. There is no need for a trade-off between optimum cognition and optimum future health. Each high-risk infant needs individualized nutrition and growth assessments. This review aims to examine infant growth expectations and messaging for parents of preterm and term-born infants within the broader causal framework.",

      "title": "Hunger",
      "abstract": "Hunger is a specific and compelling sensation, sometimes arising from internal signals of nutrient depletion but more often modulated by numerous environmental variables including taste or palatability and ease or cost of procurement. Hunger motivates appetitive or foraging behaviors to find food followed by appropriate proximate or consummatory behaviors to eat it. A critical concept underlying food intake is the flux of chemical energy through an organism. This starts with inputs of food with particular energy content, storage of excess energy as adipose tissue or glycogen, and finally energy expenditure as resting metabolic rate (RMR) or as metabolic rate is modified by physical activity. These concepts are relevant within the context of adequate theoretical accounts based in energy homeostasis; historically, these are mainly static models, although it is now clear that these do not address practical issues such as weight gain through life. Eating is essentially an episodic behavior, often clustered as meals, and this has led to the idea that the meal is a central theoretical concept, but demonstrations that meal patterns are greatly influenced by the environment present a challenge to this tenet. Patterns of eating acquired during infancy and early life may also play a role in establishing adult norms. Direct controls of feeding are those that emphasize food itself as generating internal signals to modify or terminate an ongoing bout of eating, and include a variety of enteroendocrine hormones and brainstem mechanisms. Additionally, many studies point to the essential rewarding or hedonic aspects of food intake, including palatability, and this may involve integrative mechanisms in the forebrain and cerebral cortex.",

Sociocultural norms pertaining to an ideal of\r\nthinness for women are considered central in the development of disordered eating and\r\ndisturbed body image. On the other hand, adoption of a feministic ideology, empowerment\r\nand self-efficacy are thought to have protective value with regards to body image and eating\r\nbehavior. Undergraduate women (n = 184) enrolled in psychology classes completed selfreport\r\nmeasures of feminism, empowerment, self-efficacy, body image and eating\r\nattitudes/behavior. Inconsistent with hypotheses, there was no relationship between feminism\r\nand disordered eating. However, as hypothesized, positive perceptions of personal body\r\nimage related positively with later stages of feminism. Negative body image and disordered\r\neating were associated with lower self-efficacy, and, consistent with hypotheses, self-efficacy\r\npredicted disordered eating and body image beyond what was predicted by empowerment.\r\nSelf-efficacy may serve as a protective factor for college aged women from disordered eating\r\nand negative body image, although the present study is limited by reliance on correlational\r\nrather than longitudinal data.

Moreover it is not clear whether it is the total amount of fat in the body, the proportion of fat or the rate at which excess fat is deposited which is most significant for health and fitness. Definition of obesity is complicated by variations in the normal amount and distribution of fat with age, sex, genetic inheritance and physical fitness, irrespective of nutritional state.",

      "abstract": "This chapter addresses issues related to being overweight and obese. In the past, obesity was considered simply as a state in which fat stores are visibly excessive, impairing health and quality of life. It was viewed largely as the result of excessive food consumption (gluttony) and lack of exercise (sloth), reflecting poor decision-making and lack of self-control. Body fat, at a degree that is excessive for an individual's age, sex, and race, impairs every aspect of health—physical, mental, social, and genomic. As such, obesity has become an exciting field of biomedical research, with more complete understanding of its biological basis. Both biological and environmental conditions are necessary to perturb the complex regulation of energy balance: in order to avoid weight gain and/or to lose weight, an individual must negotiate a powerful obesogenic environment. The chapter then looks at the measurement, clinical consequences, and management of obesity.",

El impacto emocional puede ser profundo, y muchas veces subestimado por los equipos de salud, afectando la calidad de vida y el proceso de recuperación del paciente. En muchos casos, los pacientes reportan sentimientos de despersonalización y pérdida del atractivo físico, lo cual afecta su autoestima y sus relaciones interpersonales. Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de síntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirugía de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptación es también común, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentación, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo físico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminución del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones íntimas. Así mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en público. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta clínica que trascienda lo técnico y abrace la dimensión humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucción de la identidad psicológica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, será posible favorecer una adaptación saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena más allá de la ostomía.

      "title": "Underweight and Overweight Children",
      "abstract": "Normal body weight and adequate weight gain are two of the most important signs of good health. However, it is important to realise that although they may be closely related, it is not uncommon to find small, 'light' children who gain weight appropriately. In general terms, while weight gain may be said to be affecting present health status overall, body weight is governed by more long-term factors. Body weight can be closely linked to height (which itself is determined by parental, constitutional and genetic factors) and to a lesser extent, nutrition. So in any random group of children of similar age you will naturally find a wide variation in height, size and weight, with a number of children apparently 'small' for their age. This latter group can easily be identified in almost any class of children and they are often 'picked on' or made fun of by the other children because of their small stature. (See BULLING.) Usually these children are constitutionally small, and they grow and gain weight at a rate appropriate to their size; they can be considered as normal in every other sense. This is the commonest cause of 'small stature' that is referred for medical opinion. True dwarfism is very rare, and may be caused by a small number of skeletal, hormonal and chromosomal abnormalities, all of which may need skilled investigation for detection.",

Ademas, los habitos y el estilo de vida son considerados como marcadores pronosticos de un envejecimiento satisfactorio y estan asociados en gran medida con el nivel social y educativo de la persona.\n La reduccion de los niveles de actividad fisica que tiene lugar durante la senectud se ha relacionado con ciertos aspectos de salud como la predisposicion a desarrollar ciertas enfermedades, cambios en la composicion corporal, un deterioro en el mantenimiento de la independencia, una alteracion de la funcion motriz y cognitiva o una perdida de autonomia, entre otros.\n Desde las ultimas decadas se ha observado como la conducta sedentaria esta presente en un porcentaje elevado de la sociedad occidental, siendo catalogada como un factor de riesgo independiente de los niveles actividad fisica y con repercusiones igualmente negativas para la salud y la condicion fisica de las personas. Pese a que las personas mayores son el grupo poblacional que mas tiempo permanece en conducta sedentaria a lo largo del dia, pocos estudios hasta la fecha han determinado la influencia que este hecho puede tener en el deterioro de la condicion fisica funcional, descrita como uno de los mejores predictores de aspectos relacionados con la salud.\n Por lo tanto, el objetivo general de la presente tesis doctoral es el de ampliar el conocimiento cientifico sobre las relaciones que se establecen entre los diferentes estilos de vida, la composicion corporal y los niveles de condicion fisica en una muestra representativa de la poblacion mayor espanola no institucionalizada.\n Un total de 3136 personas mayores de 65 anos procedentes de 6 comunidades autonomas de Espana participaron en el Proyecto Multicentrico EXERNET. Se evaluo la composicion corporal mediante bioimpedancia electrica. Los habitos de actividad fisica, horas de caminar, horas de estar sentado y otros aspectos socio-economicos y de salud se registraron a traves de un cuestionario previamente validado. Para la evaluacion de la condicion fisica se realizaron ocho test pertenecientes al “Senior Fitness Test Battery” y al “Eurofit Testing Battery”.\nEl nivel educativo se observo que estaba inversamente relacionado con el desarrollo de la obesidad (%GC) y de la obesidad central en las personas mayores. Ademas, las prevalencias de obesidad central, cuantificada a traves del perimetro de cintura (PC), son significativamente mas elevadas para los hombres y mujeres con bajo nivel educacional.\n En relacion a la influencia que un estilo de vida sedentario puede tener en la condicion fisica, los resultados muestran que las personas mayores que permanecen sentadas durante mas tiempo a lo largo del dia, poseen peor condicion fisica en las variables de fuerza, equilibrio, agilidad, velocidad de la marcha, capacidad aerobica y flexibilidad.\nComo conclusion, el nivel educativo, asi como el numero de horas de sedestacion, son dos de los factores condicionantes de la composicion corporal y la condicion fisica durante el envejecimiento.",

      "abstract": "In a rapidly changing Western society, with its strong emphasis on a slim female body as the ultimate goal, it probably gets increasingly difficult for the early-adolescent girl to accept the normal weight gain that accompanies the onset of puberty. As a result of the many physical, cognitive and social changes and necessary adaptations that have to be made, many early-adolescents experience this time of life as a crisis. Although a considerable body of research has been done with regard to various aspects of early-adolescent development, including aspects such as overweight and the development of a positive body image, the role of culture, obesity stereotypes and the thin ideal in the development of early-adolescent self-esteem, very little has been done with regard to the early-adolescent girl’s experience of weight gain as part of the experience of self. We argue that the early-adolescent girl’s body cannot be separated from the rest of her self. Accepting or not accepting physical changes such as gaining weight, and experiencing it positively or negatively, therefore also has consequences for how she experiences the rest of the self. We believe that it is not only about her own perceptions, standards and experiences, but also about those of others and society, and in this case then specifically their viewpoints on weight. Our point of departure therefore asks for a conceptual framework that focuses on the early-adolescent girl’s socio-psychological and -cognitive experiences of weight. We believe that combining symbolic interactionism and a life-course perspective provides the opportunity for the prospective researcher to study the early-adolescent girl in her entirety, understanding her experiences and behaviour, instead of merely trying to identify a few factors or possible causes for her behaviour.",

For many, this discrepancy begins in adolescence. For alcoholic women, it is difficult to ascertain whether their gender or their alcoholism is more damaging to self-esteem. However, some alcoholic women have low self-esteem that is so entrenched that even achieving abstinence or making improvement in drinking behavior does not help raise it. This paper examines the relationship between the fall of self-esteem in adolescent females and persistent low selfesteem in some alcoholic women.",

Weight discrimination is becoming more and more prevalent in schools, the workplace, social settings, the media, and even in healthcare.

This project seeks to identify and examine research that has been done on this subject in order to increase awareness of weight bias and to help prevent it in the future by promoting the fact that thin does not necessarily equal a healthy lifestyle, being large does not necessarily equal an unhealthy lifestyle, and that there are a variety of body shapes and sizes that can be perfectly healthy.",

      "title": "Pubertal timing – antecedent to risk or resilience? : epidemiological studies on growth, maturation and health risk behaviours : The Young HUNT study, Nord-Trøndelag, Norway.",
      "abstract": "Background: The timing of pubertal milestones influences the tempo and progression of growth and maturation, which in turn have consequences for boys’ and girls’ body size, shape and composition. Early sexual maturation has been associated with overweight and a shorter adult stature. The biological mechanisms underlying these associations are not clear, but since adipose children tend to mature earlier than leaner children, subsequent changes in height and weight could be attributed to nutrition in childhood rather than to early sexual maturation.The rapid bodily changes and the timing of these changes may also have an impact on boys’ and girls’ self-concepts, their social functioning, roles and behaviours. Early maturation is considered a risk factor for early initiation and advancement in use of alcohol and tobacco in adolescence, but is not clear if these differences persist over time. It has also been unclear whether adolescents’ perceptions of their own pubertal timing play an important role for how they actually act. Most studies concerned with pubertal timing as antecedent to risk or resilience, have been conducted on girls.The main aims of this thesis are:• To estimate the prevalence of advanced (risky) alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking in late adolescence related to the timing of sexual maturation and gender (Paper I and II).• To investigate whether the timing of sexual maturation in both genders, independently or in concert with early central adiposity, affects final height (Paper IV) or the prevalence of overweight (Paper III) as assessed in late adolescence.Material and method: To address these questions we used data from the Young HUNT 1 study (1995-1997) (Paper I,II,III,IV), and the Young HUNT 2 study carried out about four years later (Paper I, III, IV), in addition to data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the adult part of the HUNT 2 study (Paper IV). A total of 9097 students (92%) from all middle and high schools in Nord-Trondelag county participated in the Young HUNT 1 study and 8950 students completed the questionnaire. Among those, 2399 boys and girls were followed from early (baseline) to late adolescence (follow-up). Both the baseline and follow-up study included questionnaire data and physical examinations of height, weight, and waist and hip circumference. Age at menarche (AAM), the Pubertal Developmental Scale (PDS) and perceived pubertal timing were used to classify the timing of sexual maturation (SM timing). Baseline waist circumference was used to classify central adiposity (Paper III and IV), and body mass index (BMI) was used to classify overweight. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariate logistic regression modelling (Paper I, II and III) and general linear modelling (Paper III and IV) were applied to study the associations between exposures and outcomes.Results: Girls, who had matured early (OR 1.7, CI 1.2-2.4) or late (OR, 1.5, CI 1.1-2.2) were both more likely to report advanced drinking in late adolescence, compared to on time matured counterparts. Late matured boys were less likely (OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.8) to engage in advanced drinking. Daily smoking was also more common among girls who had matured early (OR 1.5, CI 1.1-2.2), than among girls who were on time (Paper I). Boys and girls who perceived themselves as early matured were more likely to report risky drinking than those who perceived themselves as being on time, both in middle school and high school. A nearly identical pattern was found for smoking (Paper II).Early sexual maturation in girls, but not in boys, was associated with overweight. This association, however, was restricted to girls with high waist circumference (>median) at baseline (OR, 2.7, CI 1.5-4.9). Early matured boys and girls with high waist were on average 5.7 cm and 3.6 cm taller than early maturing boys and girls with low waist circumference. Height was lowest in early matured boys (176.6 cm) and girls (163.8 cm) with a lean body composition at baseline. Height gain during follow-up was closely related to SM timing, but independent of central adiposity. Differences in height and weight related to central adiposity were more pronounced among those who matured early, compared to those who were intermediate or late matured (Paper III and IV).Conclusions:• Early (or rapid) maturation in girls constitutes a risk factor for advanced alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking not only in early adolescence, but also in late adolescence.• Perceptions of being earlier matured than same aged peers may increase the risk of alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking, especially in combination with high pubertal status.• The combination of early age at menarche and central adiposity increases girls’ likelihood of being overweight in late adolescence.• The combination of early sexual maturation and leanness yields short adult stature.",

Whilst experiences that may be associated with age, including changes in roles and social networks, losses and health challenges, may require adaptation of aspects of personality, personality across the life-span fundamentally influences how ageing is experienced. There are indications that extraversion, conscientiousness and openness show reduced levels in later life, but people’s rank order on personality traits remains stable. Development continues into later life, but builds on earlier experiences and ways of coping. Personality resources such as self-esteem, perceived control, self-efficacy and resilience shape the person’s response to adversity in later life, enabling older people to maintain high levels of well-being, despite the challenges. Dementia, the ultimate challenge, is accompanied by personality change, with raised neuroticism and lowered conscientiousness both predicting its onset and accompanying its course. Pre-morbid personality does also appear to have some influence on behavioural problems experienced.",

In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‐ranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‐sex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

Adequate coexistence of hunger and satiety brings health and wellbeing and inadequacy in food intake can threaten the health and survival. Eating behavior is a complex phenomenon compounded by interplay of central nervous system, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems linked with numerous neural pathways [1]. To put anything in mouth is a discernible human behavior and governed by hunger, hormones, emotions, and desires. Numerous life events may claw the normal eating behavior leading to aberrant eating pattern, if prolonged can result in Eating Disorders (ED). Anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating are common eating disorders which affects millions of people of all ages, men, women particularly teenage girls. Major causes of ED were associated with physical and emotional destructions due to psychological and socio-cultural factors. New researches are indicating its link with genetic and neurochemical pursuits. In most cases of anorexia, the victims have high self-image and want to protect oneself from body shaming. ED victims are often entrapped in fancy images of their bodies in social and media circles and are either unaware or refuse to accept their problem and its adverse consequences. ED is a manifestation of anxiety and trauma of self-image stirring to the extent of hospitalization and fatal stage.",

A recent study attempts to resolve these contrary perceptions by assessing activity patterns and fitness levels of young children and by investigating the factors affecting fitness. The National Children and Youth Fitness Study II, while not answering the question of whether the nation's younger children are more or less fit than in the recent past, suggests that their preparation for lifetime physical activity may be inadequate and provides a basis for future comparisons. Physical fitness in adults, of course, has been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis.

      "abstract": "Body image dissatisfaction or negative body image is closely related to psychological and cultural factors. The issue of body dissatisfaction becomes very important to university and college teenagers as well as adults, as this problem arises when they are too obsessed with weight satisfaction, weight anxiety and physical attraction. This issue can have a drastic impact on adolescent’s anxiety and self-esteem, due to the fact that when their weight does not reach the desired level, they will experience disorders such as depression, lack of self -esteem and eating problems. In Malaysia, the issue of image dissatisfaction, anxiety and self-esteem is increasing every year. This is because nowadays teenagers are too obsessed and fixated with body image that it affects their health. In addition, some communities also consider that body size and weight should be ideal according to the wishes of the cultural culture so many children and adolescents choose to stay slim in order to be accepted by their peers. These problems of dissatisfaction, anxiety and self-esteem are formed from cognitive, perceptual and behavioral aspects. The cognitive aspect explains how an individual thinks about himself; the perceptual aspect is seen through how other individuals assess their bodies and the behavioral aspect is also how individuals treat their bodies as desired. Thus, using the cognitive behavioral therapy intervention module can help individuals to change their assumptions and beliefs about the problem of body image dissatisfaction.",

      "title": "Issues and Misconceptions About Obesity",
      "abstract": "Energy is a concept of universal importance. In relation to body weight regulation, one is so used to consider energy intake, energy expenditure, and energy balance that one forgets that energy is an abstract notion without physiological equivalent. The body's regulatory functions may strive to maintain carbohydrate (CHO), protein and/or fat balances, but not energy balance. The body ignores that 1 g of fat contains more than twice the energy present in 1 g of carbohydrate, an element of information needed to determine the energy balance. In applying this knowledge to consider body weight regulation, one introduces a biologically irrelevant fact. One may learn to be in awe at the body's ability to maintain approximate energy balances over extended periods of an individual's life, as a consequence of the organism's ability to maintain substrate balances, but attempts to understand this as the result of a regulatory process directed at the energy balance itself are doomed to be frustrated. Not surprisingly, failure to be aware of the inappropriate use of the energy and energy balance concepts in considering body weight regulation and obesity has spawned numerous misconceptions (1). The intent of this article is to provide direct access to the considerations that pertain to particular notions commonly cited in the context of obesity. Their presentation under separate headings should be helpful, in particular to individuals not necessarily immersed in obesity research who want to understand the meaning of specific terms and concepts. 1. Problems in applying the energy balance concept The energy balance equation is often invoked to frame issues relating to body weight regulation and obesity. The equation states that Energy Balance = Energy Intake — Energy Expenditure which appears to support the statement that obesity is due to a \"positive energy balance,\" i.e., that energy intake is exceeding energy expenditure. Unfortunately, this seemingly obvious pronouncement sets up several misconceptions (1). First, this view confuses past and present, obscuring the fact that obese individuals, like lean subjects, tend to reach a state of approximate energy balance, with similar short-term fluctuations in the energy balance. Thus, one fails to recognize that the really important difference between lean and obese individuals is the degree of adiposity at which, on average, their energy intake tends to adjust itself to their energy expenditure. This varies widely between individuals, in a manner influenced by genetic as well as by environmental conditions. Thus obesity is brought about by a failure of the interactions between body composition and food intake regulation to restrain eating when the body's energy stores are more than adequate for health (Table 1). 2. Problems with the metabolic efficiency concept Weight gains or losses generally do not exceed 1 or 2 kg per year during long periods of an individual's life (2), reflecting an error of only 1–2% in the adjustment of food intake to energy expenditure. This corresponds to an average daily difference between energy intake and expenditure in the order of 25–50 kcal. Thus even minor differences between energy intake and expenditure appear to be able, in their cumulative long-term effect, to cause or to prevent the progressive development of obesity. The second misconception promoted by notions based on the energy balance equation is that obesity could therefore be due to unusually low metabolic rates. This impression has been enhanced because rates of energy expenditures per kg body weight or per kg fat-free mass (FFM) appear to be lower in obese than in lean subjects, which is a simple artefact due to a positive intercept in the correlations between energy expenditure and body weight or FFM. Nevertheless it has led to speculations about higher \"metabolic efficiency\" in obesity, as a way to account for a higher than normal proportion of energy retention. Such a notion, sometimes tossed around without proper definition of \"metabolic efficiency\" (3), should long ago have been dispelled by the realization that total energy expenditure is raised in obesity, due to the increase in lean body mass associated with weight gain and the greater costs associated with moving a heavier body. The utter confusion introduced by the energy efficiency concept becomes apparent when one realizes that the large daily variations in food consumption that occur when food is freely available, cause energy balance to be positive on some days and negative on others. Thus, during period of weight stability, metabolic efficiency would oscillate between positive and negative values over the short term, whereas it is essentially equal to zero over extended periods. 3. The misleading emphasis on the importance of low resting metabolic rates Arguments about the potential long-term impact on body weights of differences in resting energy expenditure, or of small diet– or physical activity-induced increases in energy expenditure, hinge on the assumption that such differences would not be offset by adjustments in energy intake. This is a totally unwarranted assumption, as there is no evidence indicating that average energy intakes in subjects eating at their own discretion are \"clamped\" at some particular level (4). Several facts speak against the notion that minor differences in metabolic efficiency or in resting energy expenditure may be important for body weight regulation. (i) Stature, which is positively correlated with resting and with total energy expenditures, has no impact on adiposity (5). (ii) There is no correlation between % body fat and deviations from predicted (or \"normal\") basal energy expenditure (Figure 1) (6). Adiposity and basal energy expenditure (BEE). (a) % Body fat contents of 433 women whose ages, anthropometric data, and BEE are listed in the dietary reference intake (DRI) database (45), plotted against the deviation (expressed in terms of %) from their predicted (i.e., \"normal\") daily BEE (as kcal/day) calculated using the multiple regression equation in (45). % Body fat contents were predicted from their BMI, using the equation correlating BMI and measurements of body fat by bio-impedance in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III data (45). (b) % Body fat contents of 335 men whose ages, anthropometric data, and BEE are listed in the DRI database (45), plotted against the deviation (expressed in terms of %) from their predicted (i.e., \"normal\") daily BEE (as kcal/day) calculated using the multiple regression equation in (45). % Body fat contents were predicted from using the equation correlating BMI and measurements of body fat by bio-impedance in the NHANES III data (45). It is generally considered that causes cannot safely be inferred from correlations, especially from cross-sectional correlations. In the case considered here, however, the crucial fact is the lack of correlation. This is much simpler to interpret, as this evidence directly and simply demonstrates that factors other than deviations from predicted resting metabolic rate are overwhelming the possible effect of such deviations in determining the degree of adiposity associated with the steady state of weight maintenance. Various arguments have been made about the potential roles of futile cycles (3) and of brown adipose tissue and uncoupling proteins (UCP) in affecting adiposity by raising energy expenditure (7). However, their impact on overall energy expenditure in man appears to be small at best. Since differences in basal energy expenditure have no statistically recognizable impact on body fat contents, speculations about the potential significance of UCP and futile cycles need to be made cautiously. Given that long-term CHO balance will be maintained under all circumstances, one should only expect an effect on body fat if the resulting increases in energy expenditure were largely covered by increments in fat oxidation, setting up an effect similar to that of physical activity (see #18 below). At any rate, it is of interest to note that spontaneous food intake regulation is powerful enough to obliterate the impact that meals and foods served in uniform proportions could be expected to exert on fatness among individuals whose energy expenditures differ, for example, due to differences in stature (5). 4. Misleading expectations about the importance of \"adaptive thermogenesis\" Adaptive thermogenesis describes changes in resting energy expenditure which serve, or have the effect of diminishing weight gains or weight losses during periods of overconsumption or starvation, relative to the weight changes which would be expected if changes in resting energy expenditure were solely due to changes in body size and in the thermic effect of food (8). This phenomenon has thus been considered to reflect a kind of \"metabolic adaptation.\" While adaptive thermogenesis has been found to be substantial in some animal models, they are modest in humans, to the point that it has been difficult to establish them unambiguously. The fact that differences in resting energy expenditure have no statistically recognizable impact on adiposity (see Figure 1) argues strongly against the view that differences in adaptive thermogenesis, which occur only occasionally, play a significant role in preventing or promoting the preponderance of obesity. 5. Problem in judging the importance of de novo lipogenesis and of its metabolic costs Several reactions in the fatty acid synthesizing pathway require adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so conversion of glucose into fat requires a substantial investment of energy. If the costs for prior conversion of glucose into glycogen as well as for the transport of fatty acid synthesized in the liver to adipose tissue are also included, the cost for conversion of dietary carbohydrate into fat may be assessed at some 25% (9). The net ATP yield, i.e., the total number of ATP generated minus the number of ATP expended for the transport, activation, and remodeling in the metabolic process, was evaluated in refs. 3 and 10. This yield is higher during fatty acid oxidation than during glucose oxidation. The net ATP yield from ingested glucose followed by the oxidation of that amount of fat is thus not much affected by initial conversion of glucose to fat, or by the concomitant occurrence of lipogenesis and oxidation of a matching amount of fat (10). Thus, contrary to a still commonly held expectation, dissipation of dietary energy by conversion of glucose into fat cannot explain why high-carbohydrate diets are less conducive to obesity than high-fat diets (11). In fact, the issue is essentially moot, mainly because fatty acid synthesis from glucose, estimated at some 10 g/day (12) in subjects consuming a Western diet, is of minor quantitative significance and not sufficient to compensate for concomitant fat oxidation even after massive CHO loads (13). 6. The irrelevance of the \"nutrient-partitioning\" concept The concept of nutrient partitioning has been developed in the context of meat production, where the proportions of nutrients consumed retained as muscle or fat is important. It is relevant for periods of rapid growth, but it has also been considered in discussing the problem of obesity, in attempts to understand the differences in degrees of adiposity reached by different individuals (14). However, in lean as well as in overweight adults whose weight is relatively stable, essentially all the nutrients consumed over a period of a few days are oxidized, regardless of diet, level of physical activity, and degree of adiposity. Furthermore, the large variations in physical activity, food consumption, and energy balance occurring under free-living conditions cause nutrient balances to vary considerably from day to day. Thus the nutrient-partitioning concept is rather meaningless when applied to adult humans. 7. Failure to recognize the different impacts of energy intake and energy expenditure on energy balance Food intake elicits an increase in energy expenditure, known as the \"thermic effect of food\" (TEF). It is mainly due to the need to regenerate the ATP used for the absorption, transport and storage of the nutrients consumed (15). It is usually considered to amount to about 10% of the food energy consumed when living on a mixed diet. In addition, modest increases or declines in resting energy expenditure occur during periods of excessive or deficient energy intake, which are commonly referred to as adaptive thermogenesis (cf. #4). The sum of the latter plus TEF is often referred to as diet-induced thermogenesis. These changes can only slightly attenuate, but not reverse, the impact of changes in energy intake on the energy balance. Unfortunately, the energy balance equation suggests that energy intake and energy expenditure occupy equivalent roles in determining energy balance, when in fact the factors governing energy intakes influence the energy balance far more powerfully than the factors determining resting energy expenditure. This important fact does not become evident by a simplistic consideration of the energy balance equation. 8. Difficulties in understanding food intake regulation In spite of the multitude of physiological phenomena known to contribute to the regulation of food consumption, variations in daily food intake are very large. The coefficients of variation for intraindividual energy intake were found to average ±23% (16). Furthermore, changes in food intake are not closely synchronized with variations in energy expenditure, which can also be substantial (17). Evidently, metabolic functions can be readily sustained in spite of large daily deviations from energy balance. That is why evolution was not compelled to develop a precise control over daily food consumption. The physiological mechanisms involved in controlling food intake should therefore be expected to explain only a minor part of the observed variability in daily food intake. This has made it difficult to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, there appears to be considerable redundancy in this regulation. Thus, inactivation or stimulation at one control site may lead to temporary disruptions, but weight maintenance generally tends to become re-established subsequently, albeit possibly at a different level. Since most individuals maintain stable body weights during long periods of their lives (2), and since changes in resting energy expenditure cannot compensate for changes in intake (cf. #7), it can be inferred that food intake tends to adjust itself remarkably well to energy expenditure over the long term, even though large daily deviations from energy balance occur. Therefore, adjustment of intake to expenditure in humans must obviously be happening over periods of several days. This view is supported by the recent recognition of corrective responses occurring with 3–4-day delays (18). 9. Conditions for body weight stability: \"settling point\" vs. \"set point\" Although less obvious than the fact that energy intake must be equal to energy expenditure, weight stability also requires that the substrate mixture oxidized be equivalent, on average, to the composition of the nutrient mix consumed. When \"substrate balance\" is not achieved, changes in body composition occur, which in time are bound to elicit adjustments in food intake (15,19). The contributions made by carbohydrate and by fat to the fuel mix oxidized is reflected in the ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed. This ratio is known as the \"respiratory quotient\" or \"RQ.\" It varies between the values of 1.0, when CHO is the predominant fuel, and 0.7, when oxidation of fat provides most of the body's energy. The ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed during the biological oxidation of a representative sample of the diet consumed is defined as the \"food quotient\" or \"FQ\" (15). Stable body compositions will only be sustained if the average RQ matches the average FQ of the diet. The composition of the fuel mix oxidized and hence the average RQ are influenced by the size of the body's substrate reserves. The steady state of weight maintenance thus tends to become established for a particular body composition in a given individual living under a particular set of circumstances. This corresponds to a \"settling point\" (20). Such a view accommodates the fact that circumstances cause weight stability to occur for various degrees of adiposity. Thus it seems to fit reality much better than the concept of a \"set point\" or \"ponderostat\" (21) often invoked to explain weight stability. In fact, such a concept would seem to be utterly inconsistent with the rise in the preponderance of obesity, since set-points would have to be seen as preventing the impact of changing circumstances. It has sometimes been considered that \"set-points\" are reset for different conditions, but in effect this argument reduces the set-point phenomenon to a settling point. Rapid weight changes take place during growth, as well as sometimes in adults. Such changes reflect the fact that their body composition is still substantially different from that which corresponds to the steady state of weight maintenance. 10. Problems with the application of the RQ/FQ concept An RQ greater than the FQ indicates that CHO makes a greater, and fat a smaller, contribution to the substrate mix oxidized than their relative proportions in the diet (3). On the other hand, a RQ/FQ ratio below 1.0 reflects the oxidation of a fuel mix containing a higher proportion of fat than that provided by the diet. While this insight is theoretically valid, the differences between RQ and FQ under conditions of variable nutrient intakes are small and greatly influenced by daily events. Except under tightly controlled conditions, the RQ/FQ ratio cannot be established with sufficient precision to predict whether weight gain or loss would take place. Reports finding no correlation between RQ/FQ data and body weights or body weight changes should therefore not be taken to challenge the validity of the RQ/FQ concept. 11. The \"defense of body weight\" concept The common tendency of individual body weights to return to their original value after a weight-changing intervention is often explained as the manifestation of a mechanism tending to \"defend\" a particular body composition. The problem with this concept is that it appears to imply that mechanisms exist to actively drive the fat mass to a particular level, much as one would expect if a set-point mechanism existed (21). It fails to take into consideration that before the intervention, body composition for a given individual had already evolved until a steady state of weight maintenance had become established. The body composition, that prevailed before such an intervention will naturally tend to re-establish itself when the disrupting intervention has ceased, not because a given adiposity is \"defended\" or \"targeted,\" but because weight maintenance tends to become re-established at the settling point, i.e., at the particular body composition which that individual had previously reached under this set of circumstances (19). Discussion of differing interpretation of such concepts as settling point, set point, ponderostat, and defense of body weight, which all appear to provide tenable explanations for common observations, may seem to be futile, until one tries to understand how environmental and dietary factors can influence adiposity and the preponderance of obesity. 12. The different roles played by carbohydrates and fat in energy metabolism Dietary carbohydrates and fats both provide substrates for the regeneration of the ATP expended to sustain the body's functions. Carbohydrates generally contribute 40–60% of dietary energy and daily CHO intakes in adults consuming mixed diets range from 200 g in relatively small and sedentary individuals to >500 g in physically active persons. The body's glycogen reserves may be estimated to vary between 1.0 and 1.5 times the amount of carbohydrate consumed and oxidized during a typical day (22). The body's fat content commonly amounts to 10–15 kg, being much larger in obesity. The triglyceride reserve typically ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 kcal in adults and it is thus some 100 times greater than the CHO reserve of 1,000–2,000 kcal present in the form of glycogen. Given its small size in relation to its turnover and the importance of maintaining adequate blood glucose levels, maintenance of appropriate glycogen stores present a considerable metabolic challenge. Evolution was therefore compelled to develop appropriate regulatory features to adjust glucose oxidation to carbohydrate availability, through adjustments of the activity of key enzymes and by hormonal signals, notably those conveyed by insulin and glucagon. Thanks to these, large variations in carbohydrate intake can be accommodated without noticeable stress. Other phenomena cause the oxidation of amino acids to adjust themselves to protein intake, as recognized long ago by monitoring nitrogen balances. On the other hand, the body's large fat stores are hardly affected by daily gains or losses and adjustment of fat oxidation to fat intake has received much lower priority in metabolic regulation. Indeed, consumption of fat has little or no effect on fat oxidation, which declines even following fatty meals (23)! The rate of fat oxidation varies greatly during the day, depending on nutrient intake and physical activity, but the amount of fat oxidized in a 24-h period is in effect primarily determined by the difference between total energy expenditure and the energy provided by CHO plus protein intakes (19). While numerous mechanisms operate to prevent large deviations from CHO and protein balances, no such functions are at work to limit daily fat imbalances. Not surprisingly, deviations from fat balance can be much greater than deviations from CHO and protein (or nitrogen) balances (24). It follows that energy balance cannot be expected to be more accurately maintained than fat balance. The roles which CHO and fat play in the body's fuel economy and in body weight regulation are therefore markedly different, another fact that is neglected when only the energy balance is considered (1). Over the long term, changes in free fatty acid levels and in insulin sensitivity brought about by gains or losses in the adipose tissue mass influence the average rate of fat oxidation (19,25). Thanks to this long-term or \"chronic\" influence, body composition will drift toward the degree of adiposity for which the average rate of fat oxidation has become commensurate with fat intake (19). Another important consideration needs to be made here, namely that fat oxidation is restrained by high glycogen levels (26), so a greater expansion of the fat mass is needed in individuals who maintain relatively high glycogen reserves. 13. Food intake regulation and carbohydrate balance Spontaneous food consumption is increased after periods of food deprivation, and inhibited after deliberate weight gain, but only until the status prevailing under the habitual ad libitum conditions is re-established. This makes it glaringly apparent that food intake regulation does not have maintenance of energy balance as its primary purpose! In addition, it becomes evident that body composition is an important parameter in the regulation of food intake (19). Maintenance of appropriate glycogen levels under conditions of ad libitum food intake would be facilitated if, in addition to adjustment of glucose oxidation to carbohydrate intake, food intake were to be regulated in a manner helping to sustain the balance between the use of glucose and the influx of dietary carbohydrate. Making such considerations at a time when the existence of specific glucose receptors in the brain had just been revealed, Mayer (27) developed the concept of \"glucostatic\" regulation of food intake, in which it is presumed that monitoring of blood glucose levels by the brain generates signals for the regulation of food intake by the central nervous system. Indeed, it is now known that transient small declines in blood glucose levels tend to elicit feeding (28). However, blood glucose levels vary greatly during the day, and there is much overlap between the values that prevail under different nutritional and metabolic conditions. Subsequently, it was therefore considered that changes in liver glycogen levels (29) or in liver substrate oxidation rates (30) would be more suitable or more likely to provide appropriate feedback signals to the brain, as such inputs can be based on some integrated parameter of substrate and carbohydrate utilization and availability. Little is known about the mechanisms and signals, that may be involved, though there is a possibility that they could be transmitted to the central nervous system via the autonomous nervous system (31). One could also entertain the notion that the rate of change instead of, or in addition to, the size of the body's glycogen stores could provide signals affecting hunger. This would account for the fact that hunger is greatly attenuated after a few days of total starvation and relatively well tolerated on protein-sparing diets (32), once the organism has become adapted to low but stable glycogen and blood glucose levels. 14. The difficulty in obtaining experimental evidence about the role of carbohydrate balance in food intake regulation In one of the few studies suitable to examine this issue, Stubbs et al. (33) used continuous indirect calorimetry in a respiratory chamber to established 24-h substrate balances in young men eating ad libitum over 7 consecutive days. They observed a negative correlation between 24-h carbohydrate imbalances and subsequent food intakes, which accounted for 5–10% of the variance in the next day's energy balances and hence energy intakes. Considering that most factors influencing food consumption and variations in the daily energy balance occur pretty much at random once a particular lifestyle has become established, even modest, but systematic, regulatory effects have the potential to exert significant long-term \"steering effects.\" These may be difficult to establish with statistical certainty during the short experimental periods feasible in humans. The situation is similar to casino games, where the small percentage gains programmed for the house would be difficult to characterize in the short run, but lead in time to significant profits. 15. The need to distinguish between the role of carbohydrate balance in food intake regulation and the role of habitual glycogen levels in body weight regulation Regulation of food intake in a manner helping to maintain carbohydrate balance provides means to achieve body weight stability, but only when the situation has been reached for which the composition of the fuel mix oxidized matches, on average, the nutrient distribution in the diet. However, in relation to body weights and health, the mechanisms involved in stabilizing body weights are less important than the factors determining the body fat content for which weight maintenance tends to occur. Glycogen levels are spontaneously maintained at levels sufficient to prevent hypoglycemia and to carry out habitual physical tasks. They also spontaneously remain far below the level at which rapid conversion of carbohydrate into fat is induced in adults consuming mixed diets (12,13,34). Glycogen levels in adults can be estimated to vary between a lower limit of some 150–200 g and an upper limit of 500–600 g. Glycogen levels are known to be higher on high-carbohydrate than on low-carbohydrate diets (22). They are therefore not likely to vary over the entire range when conditions are stable, but to oscillate within a narrower range. Since neither the lower nor the upper limits are specifically determined, the range within which glycogen levels are habitually maintained can differ among individuals and be affected by circumstances as well. Although actual measurements of glycogen levels in human populations are not yet available from which one could gauge the influence of glycogen levels in reducing fat oxidation, this effect can be recognized in experiments performed in respiratory chambers, where changes in glycogen content could be calculated (26,33). When the range within which glycogen levels are habitually maintained rises, daily fat oxidation can be expected to decrease, promoting fat accumulation. Thus, the role which increased habitual glycogen levels will play in promoting obesity in humans needs to be recognized! An attempt was made to assess the scope of this effect in a computer model of human metabolism that reproduces some of the behaviors known to regulate substrate utilization in humans (35). Minor upward shifts in habitual glycogen levels led to substantial body weight gains, whereas decline in glycogen levels entrained significant weight losses. The model's behavior thus supports the view that changes in glycogen levels too small to be documented by current means conceivably can explain recent gains in adiposity. 16. Understanding the recent increases in the preponderance of obesity During the past few decades a continuing increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States has occurred (36), even though neither the population gene pool nor the parameters considered to have caused the progressive increase in obesity in affluent societies, such as higher dietary fat content, greater buying power, and decreased physical activity, appear to have changed substantially during this period. However, food diversity and its appetizing qualities (37), changes in its energy density and increased portion size, wider choices, and advertising efforts have continued to increase. In various ways, these factors encourage food consumption so that higher glycogen levels are reached after meals. Furthermore",

Analysis of fetal weight and conception age suggests that mammals can be segregated into three or four groups each having a different growth rate. Irrespective of whether the species displays fast, intermediate or slow growth the overall rate through late embryonic and fetal development is quite smooth, with no noticeable periods of fast or slow growth. There is a gradual decline in the rate from fast in early development to a slower rate as birth approaches (Snow, 1986 for review). Significant departures from the predicted growth curve, either above or below the norm, are regarded as pathological and have a correlation with abnormalities of various sorts (Neligan et al., 1976; Spiers, 1982; Gould, 1986; Jones, Peters & Bagnall, 1986).",

      "abstract": "Discrimination is pervasive and harms physical and psychological well-being. Understanding associations between reasons for discrimination and consequences could provide insight for harm-reduction efforts, including identifying vulnerable youth. Unlike other types of discrimination, some people unfortunately consider weight-based discrimination \"socially acceptable\" because of the misperception that higher body weight is caused by low self-control and motivation. The present study examined reasons for discrimination, including weight-based discrimination in childhood and adulthood, and associations with mental and physical health. Adults (N=397) reported perceived reasons for discrimination and experiences of childhood bullying related to weight, as well as current physical and mental health. Analyses of variance tested whether perceived reasons for discrimination, both independent and intersectional, were related to health. Weight-based discrimination was most frequently reported, followed by gender-, physical appearance-, race/ethnicity-, and age-based discrimination. Weight- and race/ethnicity-based discrimination were associated with greater frequency of discrimination experiences. Weight as a main reason for discrimination was associated with more weight self-stigma and internalized bias, and weight as a contributing reason was additionally associated with eating-disorder psychopathology, depression, and poor current health. Over half of participants had a history of childhood weight-based bullying, which was related to poor current health, eating-disorder psychopathology, weight self-stigma, perceived stress, and depression. Intersectional discrimination did not contribute to worse consequences than those from weight-based discrimination alone. Weight-based discrimination during childhood or adulthood appears to have negative health consequences. Further research on strategies to mitigate the harms of weight-related discrimination is a crucial next step to protect vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "There has recently been a growing interest in long-term athletic development for youth. Because of their unique physical, psychological, and social differences, children and adolescents should engage in appropriately prescribed exercise programs that promote physical development to prevent injury and enhance fitness behaviors that can be retained later in life. Irrespective of whether a child is involved in organized sport or engages in recreational physical activity, there remains a need to adopt a structured, logical, and evidence-based approach to the long-term development of athleticism. This is of particular importance considering the alarmingly high number of youth who fail to meet global physical activity recommendations and consequently present with negative health profiles. However, appropriate exercise prescription is also crucial for those young athletes who are physically underprepared and at risk of overuse injury because of high volumes of competition and an absence of preparatory conditioning. Whether the child accumulates insufficient or excessive amounts of exercise, or falls somewhere between these opposing ends of the spectrum, it is generally accepted that the young bodies of modern day youth are often ill-prepared to tolerate the rigors of sports or physical activity. All youth should engage in regular physical activity and thus should be viewed as \"athletes\" and afforded the opportunity to enhance athleticism in an individualized, holistic, and child-centered manner. Because of emerging interest in long-term athletic development, an authorship team was tasked on behalf of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) to critically synthesize existing literature and current practices within the field and to compose a relevant position statement. This document was subsequently reviewed and formally ratified by the NSCA Board of Directors. A list of 10 pillars of successful long-term athletic development are presented, which summarize the key recommendations detailed within the position statement. With these pillars in place, it is believed that the NSCA can (a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to long-term athletic development, (b) promote the benefits of a lifetime of healthy physical activity, and",

Subjective health ratings have been a central feature of gerontological research because they are associated with objective health and functional status and they are related to the use of health services.

      "title": "Physical performance during energy deficiency in humans: An evolutionary perspective",
      "abstract": "Energy deficiency profoundly disrupts normal endocrinology, metabolism, and physiology, resulting in an orchestrated response for energy preservation. As such, despite energy deficit is typically thought as positive for weight-loss and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases during the current obesity pandemic, in the context of contemporary sports and exercise nutrition, chronic energy deficiency is associated to negative health and athletic performance consequences. However, the evidence of energy deficit negatively affecting physical capacity and sports performance is unclear. While severe energy deficiency can negatively affect physical capacity, humans can also improve aerobic fitness and strength while facing significant energy deficit. Many athletes, also, compete at an elite and world-class level despite showing clear signs of energy deficiency. Maintenance of high physical capacity despite the suppression of energetically demanding physiological traits seems paradoxical when an evolutionary viewpoint is not considered. Humans have evolved facing intermittent periods of food scarcity in their natural habitat and are able to thrive in it. In the current perspective it is argued that when facing limited energy availability, maintenance of locomotion and physical capacity are of high priority given that they are essential for food procurement for survival in the habitat where humans evolved. When energetic resources are limited, energy may be allocated to tasks essential for survival (e.g. locomotion) while minimising energy allocation to traits that are not (e.g. growth and reproduction). The current perspective provides a model of energy allocation during energy scarcity supported by observation of physiological and metabolic responses that are congruent with this paradigm.",

Human efficiency and productivity are dependent on one’s health and fitness and presently, health and fitness through physical activity are attaining popularity via exercises. Work-outs at gymnasiums highlight the changed lifestyle among youngsters, as a means of looking good, and among older ones for keeping fit and healthy. Since health is a form of homeostasis, balancing inputs and outputs of energy and matter in equilibrium, it implies good prospects for continued survival. However there is a cause for concern from exercise-induced DNA damage where the probable involvement of oxidatively damaged DNA may trigger cancer development and also since an association between oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and age-related degenerative diseases has been observed. The present study entailed informational inputs from personnel engaged in strenuous physical activity, either to promote a state of well being or to be aesthetically better or for performance in a sport event.

      "abstract": "Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia are associated with unsuitable behavior, cognition and emotions, which could have negative consequences for a person’s well-being and health. These risks frequently appear during adolescence, as this developmental stage is characterized by physiological, emotional, cognitive, and above all, social changes that lead to a greater concern for physical appearances. The propensity of adolescents to be unhappy with their body image has been stated in many studies, in which case, the adolescent can go so far as to create distorted perceptions of his/her own body. In short, this population shows major discrepancy between the subjective measurements of their body shape (contributed by the subjects) and the real measurements assessed with objective methods, this leading to a larger proportion of eating disorders (Conley & Boardman, 2007; Gardner, 1996; Martin & Gentry, 1997). Perceiving oneself as «obese» when this is not the case indicates a cognitive problem that can be explained by learning imposed by social and cultural pressures. Thus, the self-perception of one’s body becomes a decisive factor for the development of an eating disorder, which is, in turn, more important than body weight itself (Barker & Galambos, 2003; Bessenoff & Snow, 2006; Cash & Deagle, 1997).",

In sensory and nutrition research, age-associated losses in sensory function are believed to change the perception of food, to decrease food liking and consequently to decrease food intake of the elderly, although data in support of this line of assumptions are currently scarce. Consequently, there is a growing need to understand more about age related changes both in food perception and food liking. Therefore, the present thesis describes research on food perception, food liking and sensory acuity with increasing age. The results demonstrate that the elderly indeed perceive foods differently compared to the young, mainly as less intense in flavour and in creaminess/fattiness. However, their food liking is not reduced, despite these age-related changes in perception. It is concluded that decreased sensory acuity, although causing losses in perception of the elderly, is obviously not causing a reduced food liking and thus may not be the predominant reason for a diminished food intake.",

Muitos fatores podem contribuir com a construcao de uma Imagem Corporal (IC) negativa, como sexo, idade, meios de comunicacao e cultura. Devido a insatisfacao corporal os individuos acabam desenvolvendo transtornos alimentares associados a IC, destacando-se a Dismorfia Muscular (DM), popularmente conhecida como Vigorexia, que acomete principalmente o publico masculino, que esta ligada na preocupacao com a ideia de que o proprio corpo e muito pequeno ou insuficientemente musculoso, mesmo que o individuo possua uma aparencia corporal normal ou sejam ainda mais musculosos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do presente estudo foi identificar a prevalencia de Vigorexia e investigar a percepcao corporal entre homens e mulheres praticantes de musculacao em uma academia na cidade de Caico-RN. Para realizacao da pesquisa, foram aplicados tres questionarios aos voluntarios que se enquadraram nos criterios de inclusao: ficha de entrevista que caracterizou a amostra estudada; Questionario do Complexo de Adonis – QCA e Conjunto de silhuetas para identificacao da prevalencia de DM e de disturbios ligados a IC. Os resultados destacados mostraram que 75% dos homens e o mesmo percentual de mulheres (75%) alegaram estar satisfeitos com sua aparencia, e o restante (25% para homens e mulheres) demonstraram insatisfacao quanto a sua IC. A silhueta que melhor representou sua aparencia atual, foram as silhuetas que caracteriza a hipertrofia I (46,4%), seguido de magreza (32,1%). Porem, quando se tratou da silhueta que gostariam de ter, 46,4% dos participantes marcaram as imagens que se enquadravam na hipertrofia II, seguido da hipertrofia I (39,3%). Quanto a percepcao dos outros quanto a sua IC, 36% afirmaram ser as silhuetas que corresponde a magreza, seguido de hipertrofia I (34%). Na classificacao dos escores verificou-se que a maioria dos participantes foram classificados nos escores de leve a moderado (46,4% e 50% respectivamente). Quando comparado a classificacao dos escores quanto ao genero, percebeu-se que os homens (50% - leve e 50% - moderado) e a maioria das mulheres (42,9% - leve e 50% - moderado) foram enquadrados tambem nesses escores. No escore classificado como grave, sendo o Complexo de Adonis provavelmente um problema serio para os entrevistados, somente as mulheres integraram essa classificacao (7,1%). Nenhum integrante se enquadrou na categoria gravissimo. Os resultados demonstram que apesar da existencia de varias pesquisas voltadas a essa tematica, a investigacao de DM entre mulheres ainda e escassa, tornando estudos comparativos como esses indispensaveis, assim como outros que possam analisar uma melhor forma de identificacao, prevencao e tratamento multidisciplinar da vigorexia.",

Would he do better, for example, to compare it with the average for individuals of the same height, of the same weight or of the same chest measurements; or should he use some combination of these? Obviously, that standard is best which shows the least variation among normal individuals. The convenience of the standard also deserves some consideration, for a convenient standard is more",

      "abstract": "Recent research suggesting that a high proportion of men and women remain sexually active well into later life refutes the prevailing myth that aging and sexual dysfunction are inexorably linked. Age-related physiological changes do not render a meaningful sexual relationship impossible or even necessarily difficult. In men, greater physical stimulation is required to attain and maintain erections, and orgasms are less intense. In women, menopause terminates fertility and produces changes stemming from estrogen deficiency. The extent to which aging affects sexual function depends largely on psychological, pharmacological, and illness-related factors. In this article I review the physiological sex-related changes that occur as part of the normal aging process in men and women. I also summarize the effects on sexual function of age-related psychological issues, illness factors, and medication use. An understanding of the sexual changes that accompany normal aging may help physicians give patients realistic and encouraging advice on sexuality. Although it is important that older men and women not fall into the psychosocial trap of expecting (or worse, trying to force) the kind and degree of sexual response characteristic of their youth, it is equally as important that they not fall prey to the negative folklore according to which decreased physical intimacy is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time.",

Studies have shown that adolescent girls tend to have lower self-esteem and more negative assessments of their physical characteristics and intellectual abilities than boys have. These findings may explain why the incidence of suicide attempts, depression, and eating disorders is substantially higher in girls. Future research on methods for promoting self-esteem may help reduce the negative feelings of adolescent girls, as well as the problems that stem from them.",

The associations of prolonged sedentary behaviour with both physical and mental health are less researched than in adults or children but show a clear pattern of increased mortality, reduced function, frailty, mental health, and longevity. Evidence on interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults is still scarce and studies show only small effect sizes, have short or no follow up beyond the intervention period and are often in combination with efforts to increase physical activity. Clearly more work in this vulnerable population, especially in those transitioning to frailty, is warranted.",

The basic needs of the human organism required to maintain health and to permit normal growth and development have been discussed elsewhere in this series. But the process of aging produces change, and thus the period of senescence or involution presents special problems in nutrition just as does the more dramatic period of conspicuous growth, or evolution, of infancy and childhood. Pediatrics made its greatest advances when it was realized that the child is not merely \"a little man\" but presents nutritional, chemical, structural, functional, immunologic and psychologic attributes characteristic of his age or stage of development. A similar attitude is essential to comprehensive appreciation of geriatric medicine.

Not eating is the basis for anorexia, and weight loss and thinness its consequence. The search for thinness, oft en quoted as the beginnings of the disorder, only translates the flexibility of an identity problem which finds one of its means of expression in the social atmosphere of the moment. Anorexia is a fierce fight against sexuality which tears adolescents from their neutrality and forces them to become women (or men).",

      "abstract": "Obesity has grown to pandemic proportions. It affects an increasing number of children, adolescents and young adults exposed to the silent comorbidities of this disorder for a longer period. Infertility has arisen as one important comorbidity associated with the energy dysfunction promoted by obesity. Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process that is determined by specific energetic requirements. The reproductive potential of males relies on hormonal-dependent and -independent stimuli that control sperm quality. There are conflicting data concerning the impact of male overweight and obesity on sperm quality, as well as on the possible paternal-induced epigenetic trait inheritance of obesity. In addition, it remains a matter of debate whether massive weight loss induced by lifestyle interventions, drugs or bariatric surgery may or may not benefit obese men seeking fatherhood. Herein, we propose to discuss how energy balance may modulate hormonal signalling and sperm quality in overweight and obese men. We also discuss some molecular mechanisms that mediate obesity-related dysfunction in male reproductive system and how paternal obesity may lead to trait inheritance. Finally, we will discuss how lifestyle modifications and sustained weight loss, particularly the loss achieved by bariatric surgery, may revert some of the deleterious effects of obesity in men and their offspring.",

These approaches estimate gross effects only and are insensitive proxies for the dynamic processes by which nutritional components affect tissue accrual. Weight provides information about calorie balance and/or hydration status, while offering little insight into functional physiology. Height is often attributed meaning in accordance with growth charts, a static group level statistical summary unrelated to individual skeletal dynamics. Evidence accumulates that the lifelong health consequences of early growth necessitate a better understanding of individual-level body composition and its developmental determinants. Empirical evidence documents that children's skeletal and head circumference growth occurs in time-specific saltations separated by intervals of no growth. These saltation events are accompanied by discrete increases and decreases in subcutaneous fat implying pulsatile metabolic changes that may or may not be reflected in weight. The mechanisms determining the timing of these saltatory growth events to emerge from stasis, as well as the required energy and chemical building blocks to fuel and support them, remain to be clarified. Their occurrence suggests that the present understanding of nutritional needs for growth is incomplete.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion Los medios de comunicacion audiovisual a traves de peliculas, publicidad o TV, relacionan la felicidad con la imagen del cuerpo, asociando hermosura, bienestar y salud. Modelos, deportistas, actores y personas con imagen publica transmiten este mensaje; es una especie de salvacion o redencion individual a traves del fisico tan extendida que se habla de epidemia de culto al cuerpo. El cuerpo se convierte en el referente mas importante de la propia identidad que homogeneiza valores a falta de otros de diferente naturaleza. Se asocia con felicidad, exito, estatus social y autoestima, y la relacion de autoestima con imagen corporal es motivo y fuente de angustia. El deseo de alcanzar el modelo ideal y la imposibilidad de lograrlo provoca un conflicto entre lo ideal y lo real. Ademas, la introyeccion de este valor se produce en edades muy tempranas, cuando las personas estan aun en proceso de formacion y desarrollo. Ya en la ninez, con muy pocos anos, 5-7-9, se internaliza el concepto positivo de la delgadez frente a la gordura1-4. En ninos de 7-9 anos, en proporcion elevada, existe una preocupacion excesiva por la propia imagen corporal y el deseo de delgadez5, 6. El autoconcepto, percepcion del individuo sobre si mismo, incluye valoraciones y juicios que repercuten en su conducta. El cuerpo adquiere tanto peso en esta autovaloracion que se concibe como un proyecto y como un objetivo personal relacionado con dominio y poder. La preocupacion por la imagen en sus facetas cognitivas, emocionales y preceptuales, resulta sobredimensionada7. El cuerpo es modulado, transformado; se practican cirugias multiples, se busca el cambio de imagen (Cher, Michel Jackson), se sobrevalora, en suma, el cuerpo y el autocuidado, se intenta un control absoluto y se sufre la tirania del mismo: todo para el cuerpo. Solo asi se conciben las multicirugias, las multiintervenciones y el panico al efecto natural de los anos. Se pueden producir situaciones de permanente insatisfaccion tras diversas cirugias para modificar aspectos del cuerpo que no son suficientemente estudiadas por dermatologos, OTR, o cirujanos plasticos. Por eso se recomienda realizar una valoracion psicologica previa a la intervencion restauradora para evitar los elevados grados de insatisfaccion8. Se comprueba que si las expectativas de cambio se centran mas en uno mismo (ganar autoestima, sentirse mejor) es mas probable que queden satisfechos con estas intervenciones plasticas en lugar de si centran las expectativas en objetivos exteriores (conseguir un trabajo, mejorar las relaciones sociales, encontrar una pareja) 9, 10. Se transmite la imagen deseable de cuerpos esbeltos en la mujer y musculados en el hombre11; ya desde la infancia se interiorizan estos modelos estereotipados a traves de juguetes y munecas, y la evolucion se refleja en esos mismos juguetes que van cambiado con el tiempo12, 13. Los adolescentes resultan especialmente vulnerables a estos mensajes porque aun no han integrado sus creencias acerca de apariencia, valores, y aspectos culturales y cognitivos14. Tener una apariencia fisica intachable se ha convertido en uno de los objetivos en la sociedad desarrollada. Es una meta impuesta en la que, como se ha senalado, se mezcla salud, felicidad, exito, belleza y cuerpo perfecto. Recurrir al ejercicio fisico, una actividad habitual de mantenimiento, puede derivar en una practica inadecuada o excesiva. Los hombres que practican mucho deporte suelen tener un nivel elevado de satisfaccion corporal ?porque buscan incrementar musculatura- lo que no ocurre en las mujeres que buscan mas perder peso15. Lo hombres insatisfechos con su cuerpo desean incrementar la masa muscular sin aumentar la grasa16-19; ellos centran mas su preocupacion en masa muscular y pelo, y las mujeres en la figura20, 21. Anorexia y vigorexia presentan distorsiones cognitivas sobre la percepcion de la forma y la imagen del cuerpo. El autoconcepto fisico negativo se considera un sintoma clave de forma que tener sentimientos negativos hacia el propio cuerpo es predictor maximo para sufrir estos cuadros5, 6, 22. Este trabajo se referira a la influencia que las modificaciones en la percepcion del esquema corporal ejerce en la presentacion de diversos procesos patologicos, la interrelacion de la anorexia nerviosa en mujer y hombre con la vigorexia, asi como de las similitudes y diferencias. Trastornos etnicos o culturales Se podrian considerar la anorexia y la vigorexia como trastornos culturales o como trastornos etnicos en el sentido adjudicado por el psicoanalista y antropologo Devereux23.

While experiences that may be associated with age, including changes in roles and social networks, losses and health challenges, may require adaptation of aspects of personality, personality across the lifespan fundamentally influences how ageing is experienced. There are indications that extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness show reduced levels in later life, but people’s rank order on personality traits remains stable. Development continues into later life, but builds on earlier experiences and ways of coping. Personality resources such as self-esteem, perceived control, self-efficacy, and resilience shape the person’s response to adversity in later life, enabling older people to maintain high levels of well-being, despite the challenges. Dementia, the ultimate challenge, is accompanied by personality change, with raised neuroticism and lowered conscientiousness both predicting its onset and accompanying its course. Pre-morbid personality does also appear to have some influence on behavioural problems experienced.",

Those who were less attractive, more babyfaced, shorter, or heavier sometimes perceived more rather than less control than their more favored peers, suggesting that individuals whose appearance creates social barriers may compensate with greater efforts to control their social environment. One notable age difference was that high babyfaceness was associated with diminished control beliefs at younger ages but with higher control beliefs in older adulthood.",

      "abstract": "The value of physical activity to health and fitness and normal growth and development is undisputed. In contrast, lack of exercise or excesses in physical activity can be harmful to the growth and development process. Normal physical maturation represents a succession of events which appear in the same sequence in all individuals but vary in both starting point and speed of occurrence. It is often difficult to distinguish the effects of regular physical activity upon fitness from the changes associated with growth and maturation. An integral component of the relationship between health and fitness is body composition. Maintenance of a desirable body composition is an integral component in health status and in the evaluation of health, fitness and physical performance of individuals. Traditionally, discussions that have considered the benefits of regular physical activity have referenced cardiorespiratory and other components of physical fitness such as muscular strength and endurance. More recently, body composition has received considerable attention with numerous individuals of all ages preoccupied with body characteristics such as body fat and muscularity. Less recognition has been given to the role that exercise plays in the maintenance of skeletal health and the potential benefits to be gained by this component of body composition. This is gradually changing with the knowledge that osteoporosis is mediated by nutritional, physical activity and hormonal influences and that inappropriate physical activity can be potentially hazardous to the immature and mature skeleton. Regular physical activity that provides an appropriate weight bearing stimulus is critical for the maintenance of desirable body composition including normal skeletal health, irrespective of age or sex. Benefits derived for body composition are equally important to personal health as the development of other components of fitness.",

      "abstract": "Bone mineral accretion during childhood and adolescence is subject to a number of influences, including body composition changes, sexual maturation and growth. Bone mass and density increase with age and vary by sex, so bone health must be evaluated like other growth outcomes, i.e. in relation to age- and sex-specific reference ranges. Peak bone mass, the amount of bone acquired at the end of skeletal development is an important determinant of lifelong skeletal health. The timing of puberty is inversely related to peak bone mass, such that individuals who experience puberty at older ages have lower bone mass in young adulthood. Height, an indicator of skeletal size, is correlated with bone mineral content and density. Even more importantly, children who are tall for their age have greater bone mass and density than children of average or short stature. Body composition, particularly lean body mass, has a positive effect on bone accretion because of the mechanical strains of muscle mass on bone accretion. The effect of height growth is positively associated with bone accretion, but the magnitude of the effect is not the same at all pubertal stages; in Tanner stage 5, height growth has a more pronounced effect on bone accretion than at the beginning of puberty. Understanding these complex relationships is essential to understanding bone metabolism during this part of the life cycle and the challenges of assessing bone health in children with medical conditions that threaten bone health.",

To enhance the psychiatrist's understanding of the effect of overweight and obesity on their patients' quality of life and psychological wellbeing and to examine how this can be improved, even in those patients who remain overweight.Design /Setting/Participants/ Measurements. Publications from disciplines, such as medicine, anthropology, finance, pediatrics, dietary, and surgery, are examined for insights into the psychological and societal factors associated with obesity, as well as the effects of different treatments on patients.Results. Being overweight or obese in this society is disparaged, even by young children. A negative body image can lead to psychological distress. This can affect one's wellbeing, even to the extent of affecting one's earning potential. When comparing our culture to a non-Western one, such as Fiji, it can be seen that a large factor in this may be our society's ideals, particularly for its female members. Those who are overweight can receive physical and psychological benefits from learning to accept their weight, even in the absence of weight loss. Also, regardless of the weight attained, an overweight person's quality of life can improve from the state of losing weight.Conclusions. Despite the societal implications and difficulties with being overweight, how one feels about his or her weight can determine how much of an effect it has on one's quality of life. A psychiatrist who is aware of this is in a position to assist their overweight patients in order to mitigate these negative effects.",

      "abstract": "Human factors likely to be related to dietary intake and regarded as important across cultures and time are disease response, reproductive competence, cognitive function, work output, and social and behavioral habits. Functional failure in these domains is seen as having profound effects on health and demography. Most investigators who have examined issues of food intake and human function have accepted some indicator of an individual's body size as a measure for malnutrition. Anthropometric indicators, such as weight/age, weight/height, or height/age, are most commonly used. Unfortunately, body size reflects many other factors in addition to malnutrition, Because food intake is seldom known, it is difficult to estimate the amount of variation in size due either to nutrition or to other factors, The tacit assumption is that, within a given milieu, conditioning factors are reasonably constant and that differences in size not attributable to conditioning factors are due to differences in intake of nutrients. Thus, persons of larger stature generally appear to function better than persons of smaller stature, with respect to reproductive and disease competencies, work performance, and cognitive ability. Evidence from studies in humans also shows that food deprivation affects ability to produce healthy babies, physical performance, mental attitude, and disease experience, irrespective of body size. Communities that have evolved under conditions of recurrent scarcity will have developed and accepted what are seen to be the lowest-risk strategies for coping with the immediate and longer-range problems of survival. Because the cost of failure is perceived to be high, there will be pressure against innovation. This tendency to avoid risk-taking, in turn, may be among the grave effects of chronic food deprivation, even when deprivation is not severe.",

The physical appearance of an individual can be described by an onlooker as fat or slim and the interest of this work is to find out how body mass can affect health and ageing, knowing that body weight can mean different things to different persons based on the environment and cultural settings. This is a descriptive study and its source of data is derived from primary and secondary sources and literature from outside Nigeria serve as means of validating this work; and six hundred persons were sampled using the probability sample technique. The framework of this study is the life course approach in that, from birth to death, the human body undergoes changes and the observed changes are imperative. This work proposes that the more fat or bulkier a person is, the faster he ages and the more the associated health challenges. This work finds out that, several forces affect body mass (weight) and the amount of body mass directly affects health and the health status determines or affects ageing. Albeit, the study recommends that though certain factors that affect ageing are genetically determined, individuals should deliberately resolve to maintain healthy weight through the choice of healthy living. That is the life style of a people when modified through available knowledge; persons will attain quality health and by extension age gracefully.",

      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (OrNe) is an eating disorder characterised by a pathological interest and preoccupation with healthy foods and a healthy diet. Evidence suggests that tendencies towards OrNe may be prevalent across diet groups, and this is particularly the case in vegans and vegetarians. Our previous work has identified that alongside individual differences in obsessive compulsiveness and perfectionism, cognitive biases (attentional preference for healthy-related cues) are associated with OrNe, whereas explicit identity (as a vegan/vegetarian) is only associated with a healthy orthorexia form. No work has assessed whether one's known identity (explicit identity) or that form of identity which is based on fast acting cognitive associations (implicit identity) further differentiate healthy orthorexia from OrNe tendencies in addition to compulsiveness and perfectionism. One hundred and forty-four self-identified vegans (n = 45), vegetarians (n = 50) and meat-eaters (omnivores) (n = 49) (66 females, 74 males, 4 non-binary; M age = 35.09) completed measures of current hunger status, obsessive compulsivity, perfectionism, the Teruel Orthorexia Scale, perceived identity centrality as a vegan/vegetarian (explicit identity) and a \"self as vegan/vegetarian\" implicit association test (implicit identity). Results showed increased orthorexia tendencies in both vegans and vegetarians compared to meat eaters (omnivores) but only in terms of healthy orthorexia. In addition, no differences were shown for OrNe suggesting the diet type is not influential in pathological orthorexia. Explicit identity and current hunger status were both shown to be associated with healthy orthorexia and not OrNe. Implicit identity as a vegan/vegetarian was unrelated to both dimensions, while compulsiveness and perfectionism predicted OrNe. Despite individuals implicitly associating the self with being a vegan/vegetarian, this identity does not serve as a maker of orthorexia nervosa.",

Obesity is becoming a worldwide problem that causes not only medical consequences but also disturbances in psychosocial functioning. Contemporary culture stigmatizes obese persons, which increases the probability of them internalizing negative information about themselves, and can cause obese persons feel psychologically discomforted about their physical appearance. Obesity then, is a source of distress related to a negative body image that plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of eating disorders. Body image is an element of self-image and psychological well-being is substantially dependent on it. Research has clearly shown that obese persons are dissatisfied with their body and remain dissatisfied even after having lost weight. Obese persons more often tend to overestimate than underestimate their body size. It turns out though that not all obese people have a disturbed body image to the same degree. Most significant disturbances are characteristic of people with childhood-onset or adolescence-onset obesity, women and people suffering from a binge-eating disorder.",

These 8- to 10-year-old children expressed weight, dieting, and physique concerns that reflect Western sociocultural values and preoccupation with body weight and dieting. Sex differences were examined and revealed several but not very reliable distinctions at this young age. These findings appear to be consistent with research on adolescents.

      "title": "Narcissism as a Consideration When Designing Health and Risk Messages",
      "abstract": "Narcissism is a personality trait characterized by perceptions of grandiosity, superiority, and the need for attention and admiration. There has been an increase in focus on examining the development of narcissism and how the trait influences a range of social and health behaviors. A key feature of narcissism is that it is characterized by high self-esteem with a simultaneously fragile ego that requires continual monitoring and manipulation. Therefore, much of the behaviors narcissists engage in are linked to the drive to maintain perceptions of superiority and grandiosity. In the area of health and well-being, narcissism has been positively correlated with psychological health, a relationship that may be accounted for by self-esteem. However, there has been less research on the relationship between narcissism and physical health and well-being. There is some evidence that narcissism is linked to a variety of physical appearance-oriented health behaviors (i.e., behaviors that could affect body weight or other aspects of physical appearance, including eating and exercise). Narcissism has also been positively linked to risk-taking behaviors, including use of substances, as well as risks that could significantly impact others, including sexual behaviors and risky driving. The relationship between narcissism and health is therefore complex, with some positive correlates (e.g., physical activity), but also various health risk behaviors. In considering how narcissism might interact with health messages, communicators have to keep in mind that narcissists seem to have some deficits in judgment and decision-making, such as overconfidence and a narrow focus on rewards associated with behaviors. Their behaviors tend to be driven by managing their own ego and by drawing attention and admiration from others to maintain perceptions of superiority and grandiosity. In turn, health communicators may need to rely on creative strategies that tap into these domains of narcissism in order to effectively modify health behaviors among narcissistic individuals. Further research on the influence of narcissism in healthcare seeking and related preventive behaviors would also help to provide a more detailed understanding for how the trait influences health decisions, information that would be useful for both health researchers and practitioners.",

This chapter explores the prevalence and presentation of weight bias in youth and the consequences of growing up in an environment that does not recognize body diversity as a natural part of human diversity. Evidence suggests that being the target of weight-based prejudice and discrimination has serious and long-lasting consequences for children's physical, social, and emotional health and well-being. While higher-weight children and adolescents undeniably bear the brunt of societal weight stigma, youth across the weight spectrum are negatively affected by a culture that idealizes thinness and condemns fatness. The prevalence of body image and eating concerns, weight-related teasing, and bullying among youth underscores the need for sociocultural change in values and views around body size. This chapter considers important intersections of weight, health, and social justice in youth, and concludes with a case example of structural efforts to promote body respect and equality.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are disorders that affect people's mental and physical development.Conditions such as the environment and the physiological structure of the individual affect the individual.Generally, it can be seen in individuals of all ages, regardless of whether they are male or female.The reason it is common, especially in women, has been explained as women's self and aesthetic concerns.The individual's anxiety about being overweight, not wanting to be fat, maturing early, and wanting to be physically liked cause changes in the nutritional level and shape.On the other hand, familial factors also cause eating disorders.These are why the individual's family is overprotective and dominant, there are obese individuals in the family, and the individual has conflicts with his family.Nutritional changes made by the individual in the social process to make himself accepted or unhealthy diet and heavy exercise also cause eating disorders.In the individual's environment, efforts to comply with the perceptions of beauty imposed by society, the effect of the media in this process, and the anxiety of conforming to the standards of physical attractiveness trigger this situation.A woman with social anxiety changes her diet.Heavy diets, additional medications, heavy exercises, and behaviors that disrupt the eating pattern (such as vomiting) lead to serious illnesses.The process that starts with bodily aesthetic anxiety causes problems that will lead to situations that threaten the individual's life.In this process, the individual experiences physical and mental discomfort.Individual, familial, and social factors and eating disorders affect the physical and mental health of the individual.There are many eating disorders within the experienced process, effects, and results.These; include pica, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, binge eating disorder, emotional eating disorder, and an unclassifiable eating disorder.",

Overweight and obesity duplicate the risk of suffering from sexual dysfunctions. In Mexico, obese people show a greater difficulty to express their feelings and needs to their partners, as well as greater sense of guilt and less satisfaction after sexual relations. Also, it emphasizes sexual health as an important part both in physical and mental well-being, since obesity does not have to be a condition preventing a satisfactory sexual life.",

Notable differences across race/ethnicity exist for estimates of current drinking, level of drinking, binge drinking, alcohol abuse and/or dependence, beverage preference, driving while under the influence of alcohol, illicit drug use, alcohol or drug treatment, and alcohol-related adverse outcomes. Across race/ethnicity, substance use varies over sex, age, time, and level of acculturation. Although this variation is often similar across race/ethnicity (e.g., men drink more than women, the young more than the old), the magnitude of these differences is greater among some race/ethnicity groups. Race/ethnicity also plays a key role in substance use-related outcomes; some groups experience a disproportionate burden of alcohol-related ailments such as certain cancers, comorbid psychiatric conditions, or violence.",

      "title": "ABC of sexual health: Sexual problems of disabled patients",
      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment—almost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

      "abstract": "Abstract Absolute deprivation is generally defined as encompassing a minimal level of need rendering a person able to subsist and to participate actively in society. In practice, absolute deprivation is often synonymous with absolute poverty, defined as the absence of the minimal resources to afford the basic necessities for life. These basic needs usually refer to a minimal standard of a set of goods, which often include food, clean water, clothing, sanitation facilities, shelter, education, information, and health care. This broader definition of absolute deprivation or absolute poverty reflects an expanded notion of minimal living standards. This conception of poverty grew out of a more traditional definition of poverty, meaning income insufficient to obtain the minimum necessities for the maintenance of physical survival. These absolute measures of poverty are important in estimating the effect of disadvantage, often measured by prevalence or average intensity of poverty, on an array of population‐level outcomes, including health, well‐being, productivity, and social cohesion, as well as individual‐level measures of health, productivity, and well‐being.",

      "title": "Long-term physiological and economic consequences of growth retardation in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "The application of a lifespan perspective in human biology in recent years has shown that a number of early environmental factors influencing human growth and development have long-term biological or psycho-social consequences. Human growth is characterized by prolonged infancy, an extended childhood phase and high rates of growth during the adolescent growth spurt. It is unlikely that these characteristics would have evolved without having advantages, and curtailments have the potential for disadvantage. The present paper examines the evidence for long-term physiological and economic consequences of growth retardation in children and adolescents. The emphasis is the biological and economic imperatives of survival, subsistence, reproduction and production rather than aspects of metabolic competence. Many of the consequences of growth retardation are determined by the direct effect on body size, but many other consequences arise from the conditions that cause the growth retardation. Catch up of retarded growth can occur, but does not usually do so because of the continued presence of the retarding agents. Basal metabolism and physical work capacity are usually commensurate with the size of the individual; mechanical efficiency of physical work is unchanged, but falls in activity levels may occur along with a reduction in the pace of activity. Growth retardation in childhood is associated with a higher disease and mortality risk in adulthood, with decreased productivity and employment and promotion prospects. Studies are showing that relative deprivation and the accumulation of socially patterned exposures are important in some societies. Height and growth retardation have proved invaluable in reflecting these factors, but the next generation of studies may require more discriminating indices.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse, and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

This wide range of human stature is present not only within but also between various populations. The height of an individual is the culmination of an interaction between many genes (the genotype) and various environmental factors such as nutritional status and hormonal milieu. 'Short stature' is therefore a relative term and related to a person's ethnic, familial and nutritional background. The cut-off demarcating short stature has been variously defined as the lowest 5%,13%2 or even 0.4%3 values on growth curves for a clearly defined population at a given time in history. Traditionally, short stature is defined as a height that lies 2 standard deviations below the mean for age compared with sex-specific and ethnic-matched standards based on an appropriate healthy population. Allowances must be made for parental height, nutritional status, and sexual maturity before the diagnosis of pathologic short stature can be made. Familial short stature and constitutional growth delay are considered physiological variants of normal stature. In this chapter we will discuss the most common genetic conditions with short stature as a major feature.",

Physical fitness in adults, of course, has been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis.

This relationship is generally assumed to be a product of low financial resources or greater stress associated with low SES that promotes unhealthy diets and lifestyles. We demonstrate here that the mere subjective experience of being lower in SES relative to others is alone sufficient to causally elicit behaviors that may risk obesity (e.g., preference, selection, and intake of greater calories), independent of actual economic deprivation or stress from being subordinated. Among social species, the physiological/psychological systems regulating hunger may have been adapted to be sensitive to perceived deprivation of critical social, material, and symbolic resources that underlie social class in addition to caloric deprivation.",

      "abstract": "1. The growth capacity in length of the humerus and femur of male and female albino rats during the growth period from 23 to 150 days of age is less than the growth capacity in weight. This shows that the processes productive of bone strength are more active than those concerned in longitudinal expansion or stature. 2. Growth capacity in length is less affected than is growth capacity in weight by the systemic determinants and the factors incident to sex, weaning, and puberty. Since the findings as a whole are consistent with the assumption that bone growth in length is largely a matter of increase in cell number, while bone growth in weight is largely a matter of increase in cell size and density, the generalization is made that, in the bones at least, growth by increase in cell number is more stable than growth by increase in cell size and density. 3. A stabilization and approximation to a uniform level of growth capacity in both length and weight occurs at the culmination of puberty, which is quite like that taking place in the chemical differentiation at the same time. 4. Bone growth in length is more like body growth in length than bone growth in weight is like body growth in weight.",

El envejecimiento es un proceso continuo, multidimensional y varía entre individuos debido a factores internos y externos, no solo se define por la edad cronológica, biológica o social, sino también por la experiencia subjetiva de cada persona. Los estereotipos sobre la vejez, que pueden ser positivos o negativos, en donde influyen en la percepción y experiencia del envejecimiento. Los estereotipos negativos, como la percepción de que las personas mayores son dependientes o inútiles, pueden reducir la satisfacción y la calidad de vida. La discriminación por edad (ageísmo) y las representaciones sociales negativas afectan la funcionalidad y participación social de las personas mayores. La investigación realizada en Matehuala, México, con una muestra intencionada de 30 personas de diferentes edades reveló que las percepciones sobre el envejecimiento varían con la edad. Los adultos mayores tienden a tener una visión más negativa sobre la vejez en comparación con los más jóvenes, quienes a menudo tienen expectativas irrealistas o no consideran la vejez en profundidad. Los resultados sugieren que una actitud positiva hacia el envejecimiento y el mantenimiento de hábitos saludables pueden mejorar la calidad de vida en la vejez. Mientras que el 70% de los encuestados considera que llevar un estilo de vida saludable es clave para un buen envejecimiento, el 30% también destaca la importancia de una mentalidad positiva y relaciones saludables. En conclusión, abordar el envejecimiento desde una perspectiva positiva, centrarse en la gratitud y mantener una actitud activa puede mejorar la salud y el bienestar en la vejez, y contrarrestar los efectos negativos de los estereotipos y la discriminación.",

Some have endured gross insensitivity, disrespect, indifference, imbalance in give-and-take, or ingratitude.

      "title": "Advances in paediatric strength assessment: changing our perspective on strength development.",
      "abstract": "Our knowledge of the age and sex associated changes in strength during childhood and adolescence is relatively limited compared to other physiological parameters. However, those studies available on the age and sex associated change in strength are relatively consistent, especially for the lower limbs. Caution must be taken when transferring this knowledge to other muscle joints as the development in strength appears to be both muscle action and joint specific. Strength appears to increase in both boys and girls until about the age of 14 y where it begins to plateau in girls and a spurt is evident in boys. By 18 y there are few overlaps in strength between boys and girls. The exact age in which sex differences become apparent appears to be both muscle group and muscle action specific and there is a suggestion that sex differences in upper body strength occur earlier than lower body strength. What is less clear is the complex factors that contribute to the production of strength during childhood and adolescence. There are few well controlled longitudinal studies that have concurrently examined the influence of known variables using appropriate statistical techniques. Most studies have shown that maturation does not exert an independent effect when other factors, such as stature and body mass are accounted for. Also, the assumption that muscle cross-sectional area is the most important parameter in strength production does not hold when examined with other known variables. Consistently, stature appears to play a key role in strength development and this may be attributed to the strength spurt that has been linked to peak height velocity, and the muscle moment arm. Advances in technology have provided us with more accurate techniques to examine these explanatory variables but the complex interaction of neural, mechanical and muscular remains to be clearly identified from well controlled longitudinal studies. Key pointsThe age associated development in strength is attributable to changes in growth and maturation. Sex differences appear at around 14y and very few girls out perform boys in strength tests at 18y.Stature and mass appear to be important explanatory variables in the development of muscle strength. PHV is a particularly important time for maximal gains in strength during childhood.The muscle moment arm is possibly the most important factor in the development of muscle strength with age but further longitudinal studies using MRI are needed.",

The historical lack of mainstream sports opportunities for people with disabilities is one of the important rationales for the development of disability sport. People are considered disabled, e.g., regarding physical mobility, sight, hearing, or mental functioning, when they have biomedical conditions or impairments that limit their ability to use certain skills, carry out certain tasks, or participate in certain activities or roles. Although their overall sports participation rates remain relatively low, people with disabilities have become increasingly involved in the pursuit of sport at various levels over the past few decades.",

In this paper, we suggest that individuals may perceive themselves as more powerful when anticipating interaction with a member of a stigmatized out-group than with a member of a nonstigmatized group. Normal weight participants (N = 77) expected to have an interaction with a target randomly identified as obese or thin. Participants were quicker to endorse words describing themselves in terms of traits associated with power when the target was obese than thin. They were also likely to expect greater interpersonal power, to endorse more negative attitudes towards obese people and to form more negative impressions, if the target was obese rather than thin. These findings suggest that a perception of empowerment is spontaneously activated prior to interaction with an obese person.",

      "abstract": "Addiction, which is one of the major problems of society and is spreading severely day by day, is considered a complex process where an individual develops an uncontrollable desire for a substance or behavior, continues this desire, and has difficulty ending it despite both physical and psychological harm. Food addiction is a type of addiction where individuals consume food not only to meet their physiological needs but also uncontrollably for emotional and psychological satisfaction. Individuals with food addiction tend to eat to cope with emotional states such as stress, anxiety, and depression, leading to unhealthy eating habits and weight problems. In such addictions, the treatment process requires addressing not only the improvement of physical symptoms but also the emotional and psychological factors that trigger the addiction. Although food addiction usually arises from depression or other psychological disorders, in some cases, individuals may feel the need to eat to feel better after experiencing abuse. This situation can become uncontrollable, leading to food addiction, which negatively affects both the mental and physical health of individuals. This study is a case study of a 41-year-old woman named S.A., who developed food addiction as a result of sexual abuse by her parent at the age of 13. The gradual progression of the abuse and the subsequent development of food addiction are examined in detail, along with the effects of EMDR and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) on overcoming the food addiction.",

      "title": "Obesity and responsibility: Is it time to rethink agency?",
      "abstract": "Despite obesity declared a disease, there still exists considerable weight stigma in both popular culture and health care, which negatively impacts policy making regarding prevention and treatment. While viewed as a choice or a failure of willpower by many, evidence exists to challenge the argument that both weight gain and failure to achieve weight loss maintenance are the individuals' fault due to personal failure or lack of responsibility. In this article, we draw upon literature from obesity treatment, neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and weight stigma to challenge the commonly held beliefs that individuals are free to choose how much they can weigh, and achievement of long-term weight loss maintenance is completely subject to conscious choice. In reality, the regulation of hunger, satiety, energy balance, and body weight takes place in subcortical regions of the brain. Thus, hunger and satiety signals are generated in regions of the brain, which are not associated with conscious experience. This points towards biological determinism of weight and challenges ideas of willpower and resultant moralization regarding body weight regulation. In this article, we will thus argue that in the context of dysregulation of hunger and satiety contributing to the obesity epidemic, a wider discourse related to personal responsibility and the stigma of obesity is needed to enhance understanding, prevention, and treatment of this complex disease. Obesity is a chronic disease requiring personalized treatment. Lifestyle interventions alone may not be enough to achieve medically significant and sustained weight loss for many individuals with obesity. By understanding that obesity is not due to a lack of motivation or willpower, the availability and utilization of additional treatments or combination of treatments such as lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and surgery are likely to improve the quality of life for many suffering with this disease.",

Though many of the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, its impacts on the cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous systems, among others, bestow upon obesity an almost unrivaled ability to devastate the human sexual response. Further, the effects of obesity extend beyond the purely physiologic into the psychologic and have the ability to impair both males and females alike. The downstream sequelae of sexual dysfunction secondary to obesity can significantly impair an individual’s quality of life, affecting his or her self-esteem, opportunity to form and maintain meaningful relationships, and ability to reproduce if desired, all of which can further promote pro-obesogenic attitudes and behaviors. Thus there is tremendous incentive for appreciation and understanding of the complex interplay between obesity and sexual function, as well as their relation to an individual’s overall physical and mental health.",

While associations have been found between sedentary behavior and adiposity, they are small to very small, or even zero. Where associations do exist, they are more pronounced for self-reported behaviors, rather than those assessed with devices, and for TV viewing. Associations are highly variable and complex in nature. Coexisting behaviors of diet, physical activity, and sleep need to be assessed, and more research is needed on how sedentary time replaces, or is replaced by, other movement behaviors across the day. Total sedentary time is not associated with adiposity, but some specific sedentary behaviors, especially TV viewing, do show a small association.",

      "title": "The Evolution of Body Size: What Keeps Organisms Small?",
      "abstract": "It is widely agreed that fecundity selection and sexual selection are the major evolutionary forces that select for larger body size in most organisms. The general, equilibrium view is that selection for large body size is eventually counterbalanced by opposing selective forces. While the evidence for selection favoring larger body size is overwhelming, counterbalancing selection favoring small body size is often masked by the good condition of the larger organism and is therefore less obvious. The suggested costs of large size are: (1) viability costs in juveniles due to long development and/or fast growth; (2) viability costs in adults and juveniles due to predation, parasitism, or starvation because of reduced agility, increased detectability, higher energy requirements, heat stress, and/or intrinsic costs of reproduction; (3) decreased mating success of large males due to reduced agility and/or high energy requirements; and (4) decreased reproductive success of large females and males due to late reproduction. A review of the literature indicates a substantial lack of empirical evidence for these various mechanisms and highlights the need for experimental studies that specifically address the fitness costs of being large at the ecological, physiological, and genetic levels. Specifically, theoretical investigations and comprehensive case studies of particular model species are needed to elucidate whether sporadic selection in time and space is sufficient to counterbalance perpetual and strong selection for large body size.",

Bien avant les premiers articles scientifiques, la litterature et le theâtre mettent en exergue les effets controverses de ce breuvage sur les relations amoureuses et sexuelles.

L'alcool est implique de facon recurrente dans les violences sexuelles mais il semble qu'il soit une comorbidite associee a un trouble de la personnalite plus qu'un moteur en soi. La consommation ethylique altere le controle de ses propres pulsions et aussi la perception des reactions de l'autre selon la theorie de la myopie alcoolique.

Malgre une association negative entre l'alcool et les comportements sexuels, les etudes sont contradictoires quant au lien de cause a effet.

      "abstract": "This thesis aims to critically explore how young men aged 18-24 construct ‘health’ in terms of their knowledge, beliefs and behaviours and to examine what influence these factors may have on their own lifestyle practices, particularly, but not exclusively, in relation to food and how this informs their masculine identity. Statistics suggest that as a group young men are the worst at ‘following’ health promotion guidelines and as such are ‘positioning’ themselves as being at risk of developing certain illnesses and diseases such as cancer and diabetes as a result of this non-conformance. Men’s diets are often portrayed as being unhealthy; high in meat content and low in consumption of fruit and vegetables. \r\n\r\nFurthermore men’s health is often viewed in opposition to women’s and inequalities in health between men and women are often put down to man’s pursuit of hegemonic masculinity. \r\n\r\nThis thesis will argue that statistics alone do not tell the whole picture as men are not a homogenous group, with differences in sexual orientation, class and age, to name but a few. Therefore to help understand the health behaviours of young men better their voices need to be listen to. This thesis will seek to understand the impact health promotion messages as well as other ‘educational’ sources such as the media, have upon the knowledge, health beliefs and behaviours of young men and if these ‘messages’ help or hinder their participation in such. This thesis draws upon qualitative data to investigate how food and health are understood and negotiated by young men as part of their lived experiences and will take a thematic approach to data analysis. \r\n\r\nThe key findings suggest that the young men involved in this research had a good knowledge of what are considered healthy behaviours however these were not necessarily the ones they followed. The men were interested in their health albeit in a way of bodily appearance, particularly in respect of fatness, and presentation of an acceptable masculine physique rather than in reducing their susceptibility to illness and disease. Food for the participants was not something to be consumed in order to sustain a ‘healthy’ blood pressure for example but was something which they used as part of their physical activity regime to help build muscle and ‘keep in shape’. This was particularly important when the body was considered to be under the judgemental ‘gaze’ of others therefore being on holiday and having a ‘holiday body’ was where the display of an acceptable masculine physique was considered essential.",

Many individual or personal factors are associated with desire, including demographic attributes (e.g., chronological age, gender), mental and physical health variables (e.g., chronic illness, mood disorders), and hormonal processes (e.g., testosterone levels). Interpersonal factors are also associated with sexual desire; both passionate love and overall relationship health (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, adjustment) are strongly linked with the amount of sexual desire that individuals feel for their partners. Reductions in sexual desire are common in most romantic relationships; however, sudden or sharp decreases may signal the development of an underlying interpersonal issue. Although less examined than other variables, sociocultural factors, including norms, stereotypes, laws, and religious doctrine, may also inhibit or facilitate the experience and expression of sexual desire.",

      "title": "Sex differences in growth and neurocognitive development in infancy and early childhood",
      "abstract": "Undernutrition in early life remains a significant public health challenge affecting millions of infants and young children globally. Children who are wasted, stunted or underweight are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Undernutrition at critical periods also impacts on aspects of neurodevelopment, with longer-term consequences to educational performance and mental health outcomes. Despite consistent evidence highlighting an increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality among boys, a common assumption held across many disciplines is that girls are more vulnerable with respect to early-life exposures. In relation to undernutrition, however, recent evidence indicates the reverse, and in contexts of food insecurity, boys are at increased risk of undernutrition in early life compared to girls, with sex-specific risks for neurodevelopmental deficits. These effects appear independent of social factors that may favour boys, such as gender disparities in infant feeding practices and health-seeking behaviours. The observed vulnerability among boys may therefore be underpinned by biological processes such as differential energy requirements during periods of rapid growth. As boys have greater needs for growth and maintenance, then, in times of nutritional hardship, these needs may not be met resulting in risk of undernutrition and subsequent health consequences. In view of this emerging evidence, a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind this vulnerability among boys is needed and policy considerations to protect boys should be considered. This review will explore sex differences in risk of undernutrition and consider these in the context of existing programmes and policies.",

      "title": "What Should I Say? Talking With Patients About Sexuality Issues",
      "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive function is affected by all aspects of cancer, including cancer’s biologic processes of growth and metastasis, the effects of undergoing cancer treatment, and the psychological issues that occur as a result of having cancer and receiving treatment for it. These aspects can result in changes in body appearance, infertility and sterility, and the inability to have intercourse. The changes may be made worse by additional alterations in body image, fears of abandonment, loss of self-esteem, changes in sexual identify, and concerns about self (Krebs, 2005). Human sexuality includes three separate but intertwined aspects: body image, reproductive ability, and sexuality or sexual functioning. Body image, or the way individuals see themselves or think others see them, may be altered by changes in body appearance resulting from weight loss or gain, alopecia, mucositis, fatigue, or a variety of other changes that may not be visible to others. Changes in self-esteem may occur as a result of body image alterations, resulting in decreased desire and decreased sexual activity. Reproductive function, or the ability to bear or father children, may become impossible as a result of therapyrelated infertility, and sexual functioning may be altered by changes in self-perception, decreased desire, general side effects of treatment (including cancer therapies and methods to manage side effects of therapy), or numerous other reasons. Some individuals are at higher risk for sexual side effects than others based on age, gender, type of cancer, type of cancer treatment, or concomitant medical or psychological illness (Krebs, 2001, 2005). See Figure 1 for a list of factors that contribute to sexual diffi culties.",

      "title": "Children as a particularly vulnerable population to exposure to hazardous environmental contamination",
      "abstract": "Many environmental chemicals are known to affect children's growth, developmental and potential. Currently most of the health effects data on children are based on adults and animals; these data are neither adequate nor appropriate for evaluating health risks in children. The risk of exposure of developing embryos, neonates, infants, young children and adolescents all need to be evaluated. Children's risk may differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those of adults for a number of reasons, such as metabolism, pharmacokinetics, physiology factors, development, diet, and physical environment. Today's and future generations of children are being exposed to excessive amounts of potentially toxic substances; the issues of cumulative synergistic effects on toxicants, low level chronic exposures and inter-generational effects of exposure are all issues needing to be addressed. Children are uniquely vulnerable since the child is a growing person, interference with developing organ systems (i.e., the nervous system, the endocrine system, etc.) by environmental agents has more potential to result in long term and irreversible damage than in adults. Genetic susceptibility is important to exposures in adults and children. Inter- and intra-individual variability with respect to chemical sensitivity and exposure exists among children, as it does among adults; however, with children, developmental changes from neonate through adolescence are superimposed on genetic and environmental differences. Therefore, genetic variation in human genetic susceptibility may be greater than an order of magnitude when comparing differences between children and adults. The study of gene-environment interaction is critical to fully understand the causal factors of diseases in children. Characterization of genetic polymorphism of important genes involved in the metabolism of environmental toxicants is essential. The characterization of a genetic polymorphism of a commonly occurring gene allows scientists to begin to understand the relationship between exposure levels and cognitive impairment in susceptible subpopulations of children. Disease in children of environmental origin is preventable; however, prevention requires research. Research is needed to identify patterns of environmental disease in children, to assess children's exposures to environmental toxins, to quantify dose-response relationships, and to provide a blueprint for prevention. An important aspect of prevention is to incorporate community-based research into the larger framework of environmental health goals. Community-based prevention research seeks to increase the capability of communities to participate in the process that shape research approaches and prevention/intervention strategies. Environmental health risk posed by the location of hazardous waste sites may be distributed inequitably across regions which make-up Central and Eastern Europe, therefore, it is important to develop a child-oriented research and prevention agenda in close consultation with those who represent the interests children and other vulnerable groups in an inter-regional manner. Such a child-oriented research and prevention strategy must encompass research, risk assessment, policy formation and education.",

      "title": "The Gut Microbiome as a Key Determinant of Body Mass Index",
      "abstract": "Obesity has a complex and incompletely understood pathogenesis, with an underlying interplay between our genetic architecture and obesogenic environment. The public understanding of the development of obesity is shrouded in myth with widespread societal misconceptions, often promoted by (or at least insufficiently countered by) the mass media. This includes ideas that weight gain and obesity stem from human vices and ‘sins’ such as greed, gluttony and sloth. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a highly heritable trait. However, despite reports from recent ‘genome-wide association studies’, only a small proportion of the overall heritability of BMI is known to be lurking within the human genome. Other non-genetic heritable traits may contribute towards BMI. The gut microbiome is an excellent candidate, with complex interlinks with hypothalamic control of appetite and metabolism through both direct and indirect routes that implicate entero-endocrine, autonomic, and neuro-humeral pathways. Furthermore, recent evidence promotes a trans-generational transmission of the gut microbiome from the mother to offspring via both vaginal delivery and breast-feeding. The latter implicates a maternal ‘entero-mammary pathway’ in which the maternal gut microbiota translocate across the gut wall and are transported endogenously to the breast milk. Although maternally derived gut microbiota tend to have a permanence within the gut, other microbiota manifest mutability that responds to changes in lifestyle and diet. We should all strive to optimise a healthy lifestyle and diet that is replete with varied and unprocessed plant-based foods to nurture our gut microbiome. Women of reproductive age should optimise their gut microbiome, particularly pre-conception, ante- and postnatally to enable the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome in their offspring from birth. Finally, we should redouble our efforts to educate the populace on the pathogenesis of obesity, and the role of heritable factors such as genetics and the gut microbiome. Such understanding and insights would help to promote the widespread adoption of healthy lifestyles and diet but also help in the transition from our current dispassionate and stigmatised societal approach to obesity, to one that is epitomised by understanding, support, and compassion towards people living with obesity.",

      "title": "[High risk pregnancy: isolation and prevention].",
      "abstract": "A health policy which concentrates scarce resources on high risk individuals or groups theoretically should lead to earlier diagnosis of the condition at a lower cost for the collectivity. Pregnancy and birth the physiological processes that usaully unfold normally. Risk may be defined as increased probability of a complication such as abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, hypotrophy, or delayed death as a function of certain indicators or risk factors related to maternal age, marital status, partiy, obstetrical history, health status before and during pregnancy, nutritional status, and socioeconomic situation. There are no completely risk-free pregnancies, and not all risk factors are equally serious. It is rare that only 1 risk factor is present; several risk factors usually coexist and their combined action aggravates and risk. Social indicators and factors such as poverty, low sociocultural level, and heavy work have a particularly great weight in cases of multifactorial risk. Some elements creating increased risk, such as small maternal size, are not avoidable, while others such as smoking during pregnancy may be avoided. In each case, risks should be carefully specified in terms of the possible pathology associated with them. The medical history and first prenatal consultation can disclose events prior to the pregnancy that would threaten it, including morphological anomalies such as small size or insufficient or excessive weight; illnesses such as heart or kidney disease, epilepsy, or diabetes, and complications during previous pregnancies or deliveries, such as abortion, premature delivery, or toxemia. Anomalies of the current pregnancy observed at the first prenatal visit might include too short pregnancy interval; unfavorable conditions related to maternal age, spacing, or ages of existing children, illegitimacy, or heavy work; anomalies in the general condition such as toxemia, excessive fatique, or use of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs; and obstetrical anomalies such as hemorrhage, infection, or excessive fetal volume. Lack of prenatal care constitutes a risk factor in itself. A strategy to furnish adequate preventive and curative services for high risk women requires at the national level better health planning, definition of the functions of different categories of health personnel, and development of appropriate training programs. In concrete terms, the strategy may translate into such activities as more frequent prenatal visits, increased household assistance by family members or paid workers, bed rest, or early transfer to a well-equipped hospital. In developing countries, better basic health services and corrdination between levels of care will probably be the most important interventions for controlling infant morbidity and mortality, but improved maternal nutrition and other measures to assure adequate birth weight should not be overlooked.",

      "title": "Food noise: definition, measurement, and future research directions",
      "abstract": "The term food noise has been recently popularized by individuals managing their weight or adhering to specific diets for health reasons. Anecdotal evidence from patients and clinical observations suggests that food noise involves constant preoccupation with food-related decisions-such as which foods to eat, caloric intake, macronutrient balance, and meal timing-which can become intrusive and unpleasant. Food noise also appears to affect cognitive burden and quality of life, and is being cited as one reason weight-loss attempts fail. The increase in public discourse about food noise has highlighted its potential significance, yet a formal clinical definition and method of measurement of food noise are lacking. Herein, we define food noise through clinical and patient anecdotes, describe initial research validating a food noise questionnaire, and outline future research directions. The formal definition of food noise is persistent thoughts about food that are perceived by the individual as being unwanted and/or dysphoric and may cause harm to the individual, including social, mental, or physical problems. Food noise is distinguished from routine food-related thoughts by its intensity and intrusiveness, resembling rumination. We describe our initial research developing the Ro Allison Indiana Dhurandhar- Food Noise Inventory (RAID-FN Inventory) to measure food noise. We also outline future areas of research, including exploring the prevalence and physiological underpinnings of food noise and the role of cultural and sociodemographic factors. The effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists on food noise, the potential role of food noise in weight management and metabolic health, understanding food noise's impact on health outcomes and quality of life, the stigma associated with food noise, and the potential influence of food noise on public health policies are discussed. Future research should aim to refine definitions, improve measurement tools, and evaluate therapeutic strategies for managing food noise.",

      "abstract": "Protein‐energy malnutrition (PEM) early in life exerts adverse effects on brain growth and psychological development. However, behavioral deficits typically occur as a consequence of the interaction between PEM and environmental deprivation. Human studies strongly suggest that developmental delays are associated with malnutrition in congruence with an impoverished material and social environment. It would seem therefore that enriching the immediate social milieu through persistent and appropriate stimulation of the child physically, mentally, socially and emotionally is a major factor in the reversal and prevention of the developmental consequences of malnutrition. Nutritional supplementation then, while a prerequisite to healthy ontogeny, is by itself insufficient in bringing the child to normal levels of development.",

      "abstract": "The dissatisfaction of men due to their penile size is found in a number of studies. Concerns can be focused on the penile length or width or even both, whether erect or flaccid. Men who are worried about the penile size also want to increase the size of the penis. Concerns about men’s penile size are also increasing because they think normal penile size is what is shown in pornography. These worries can affect self-esteem, sexual function, and satisfaction, to physical and mental health. Small penis anxiety is an anxiety that arises when a man observes his flaccid penile size and feels concerned that his penile size is less than the normal size. In addition, this concern persists even though it has been refuted by clinical examination. Penile dysmorphic disorder is excessive self-concern, distress, and a preoccupation with trivial or even non-existent deficiencies in penile size and shape that can lead to impaired function. Until now, there have not been effective guidelines for managing patients with complaints of penile size. Some of the treatments that can be conducted are psychosexual counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, penile traction devices, and invasive procedures. Various modalities of therapy have been tried to overcome excessive concern about penile size. Yet, so far, no good results have been obtained. Thus, clear and effective guidelines are needed to make treatment can be carried out properly.",

      "abstract": "At any given age, there is wide variation among children in size, physique and body composition, rate of growth, and timing and tempo of biologic maturation. There is corresponding variation among young female athletes. Successful young female athletes are a highly selected group in terms of skill, size and physique, and often socioeconomic status. Comparisons of young female athletes with reference data for the general population indicate that, in general, these young females grow and mature in a similar manner as non-athletes with variation among sports. The short stature and decreased body mass observed in some élite young female athletes likely reflects the selection practice of specific sports. In some of these élite sports there may be a focus on desirable physical and maturational characteristics. It is difficult to attribute the observed variation in the growth and maturation of young athletes to the effects of systematic training. The data presently available do not meet the criteria for causality, and many factors known to influence growth and maturation are usually not considered in studies of young athletes.",

      "abstract": "Humans di er from most other animals by having a fairly long lifespan and, \nproportionately, a long period of growth before adult morphology is attained. This \nchapter considers body composition changes associated with childhood, adolescence \nand adulthood from a health perspective, before considering in more detail how \nbody composition can be adjusted in the context of sport. Although this might \nsound straightforward, consider that it might take 12 years of sports participation \nbefore a world class athlete attains a career best. Future capability needs to be \nrecognised, understood and nurtured during childhood, while maintaining present \nhealth and safeguarding future health. Excessive training perturbs the body’s \nhomeostasis in musculo-skeletal, metabolic, endocrine, immune and psychologicaldomains; however, it appears that individual tolerance of high exercise volume and \nsusceptibility to overtraining is highly variable. Variability in the tempo of \nmaturation in children can represent an advantage or disadvantage depending on \nthe sport and gender. Knowledge of these issues is important for exercise \npractitioners and coaches alike, given the growing number of people whose body \ncomposition either predisposes them to increased risk of disease, or requires their \nbody composition to be optimised in order to enhance performance and reduce \ninjury risk. In this chapter we consider how kinanthropometry can be useful in \nyouth sports for talent development and improving sports performance. We will \nexplore the relationship between structure (as measured by anthropometry), \nphysiology, psychology and skill for talent identi cation and how  using these \nfactors in isolation may risk overlooking potential champion athletes. We outline \nhow to predict adult size and proportions from the growing child (morphological \nprediction), the optimal size and proportions for the ideal sports performance \n(morphological optimisation) in sport, and how athletes can tailor soft tissue for \nmaximum functional e ectiveness by training, tapering, etc. (morphological \nprototype). In addition, we examine how performance might be enhanced or \nretarded by biological maturity and how biological maturity is a ected by energy \nbalance in the young athlete.",

Adolescence is a time of important biological, physiological, neurological, behavioural and social transitions towards adulthood. This period of transition is characterised by higher impulsivity, increased sensation-seeking behaviour, higher risk-taking behaviours relating to substance use and/or sexual experimentation, an increased sense of self-awareness/invincibility, and a higher importance of social relationships involving partners and peers rather than parents and older siblings. Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

      "title": "The short normal child : influences on the growth pathway and final height outcome",
      "abstract": "Short stature is a common reason for a child to be referred for specialist opinion. Most will have no underlying pathology but dismissing a short child as normal may impose future suffering as the short adult is perceived to be psychosocially disadvantaged and to face greater health risks. Adult height, however, cannot be predicted from childhood height with any degree of certainty. Growth begins at the moment of conception and ends with epiphyseal closure some two decades later. Height, however, is not accumulated at a fixed rate throughout the growing process but consists of four distinct phases: foetal, infancy, childhood and pubertal. The intensity and duration of each phase is subject to wide variation and poor growth in any one phase does not inevitably compromise final height. To a large extent, both stature and the tempo of growth are genetically determined but social and environmental factors can have a modifying effect. For some children, poor environmental conditions can cause growth to falter but equally an improvement in quality may result in catch-up growth. The Wessex Growth Study is the first study to follow the growth of an unselected population of short normal children from school entry until final height together with controls of' average' height. A great deal of background information was also collected for each child including parental heights, birth history, social & family background, and medical history. To determine which short normal children become short adults this thesis has compared the patterns of growth of short normal children with their average height controls and assessed the impact of genetic and environmental variables on the growth pathway and final height. Before puberty, short children grew more slowly than those who are taller but the magnitude and duration of the pubertal spurt and the adolescent height gain were similar for short and control girls, and for short and control boys. The pubertal spurt of short normal boys, however, occurred, on average, some six months later than expected. Interestingly, although short normal girls had similar birth weights, skeletal delay and were just as likely as short normal boys to be considered short for family, the timing, magnitude and duration of their pubertal spurt were comparable with the control girls and with Tanner's standards. The mean height centile of both groups improved suggesting a continuing secular trend in adult stature within the UK. Nevertheless, the increase in relative height was greater for the short children implying some degree of catch-up growth, especially for boys. Indeed, short normal girls were three times more likely than short normal boys to attain an adult height below the 0.4^ centile and below their genetic potential. Some short children have become taller adults than others but in relation to their peers, a substantial number have remained short and failed to reach their genetic potential. Growth is influenced by many factors, genetic, social, environmental and emotional, but few variables were found to be predictors of the adult height of short normal children and much of the variance remains unexplained. This thesis demonstrates the individuality of the growth pathway and the difficulty in identifying those who will become short adults. Recognising which children might benefit from intervention requires a multi-professional team including the growth specialist, social worker and psychologist.",

      "title": "Physical performance in high school students: effect of chronotype",
      "abstract": "Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) is an individual characteristic, defined as chronotype. People are typically categorized in 3 different chronotypes: Morning, Evening and Neither types (M, E and N-types), which differ in the circadian rhythm of many physiological variables. M-types use to wake up and go to bed early and to have their best performances in the first part of the day, otherwise E-types go to bed and wake up late and they have the peak performances in the evening. The chronotype is influenced by both individual and environmental factors and gradually changes during human development. Many studies have demonstrated a trend beginning with a tendency toward morningness in children that gradually evolves into a shift toward eveningness. Approximately at the age of 20 years, this shift reaches its maximum and starts to decline, leading to a growing tendency toward morningness from midadulthood on. This more pronounced eveningness has been found to negatively affect adolescents’ sleep and daytime functioning; even physical performance of adolescents can vary throughout the day because sleep pressure increases, the input from the circadian timing system is optimal or non-optimal to perform the task or both of them. In this study participated 216 students, 124 males and 92 females, attending the first two high school classes (mean age 14-15 years). For the assessment of chronotype, all students compiled the Morningness-Eveningness Questionaire (MEQ), validated by Horne and Ostberg in 1976. For all subjects we collected anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI). All the subjects were categorized as M (n=22), N (n=165), and E-types (n=29). To assess the relationship between chronotype and physical performance, from the sample we recruited 51 subjects, 22 M-type (14 males and 8 females) and 29 E-types (18 males and 11 females), who carried out three Eurofit tests (SHR, Shuttle Run; SBJ, Standing Broad Jump; Cooper endurance test). Preliminary results, although showing some differences in physical performance between E and M chronotype, have not detected statistically significant differences between the two groups.",

      "abstract": "Obesity and depression often co-occur; however, the association between these conditions is poorly understood, especially among racial/ethnic minority groups. Using multinomial logistic regression and data from the National Survey of American Life, the relationships between race, ethnicity, and sociodemographic factors to the joint classification of body mass index categories and depression among African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites were examined. Differential risk for the combination of obesity and depression by sociodemographic status was found. Being African American, female, young, married, or having low income or education increases the risk for obesity without depression. Risk factors for obesity with depression include being female, young, married and having a low income. Race was not a significant predictor of obesity with depression relative to normal weight without depression status. However, racial differences were observed among the non-depressed. Non-depressed African Americans were more likely than non-depressed Whites or Caribbean Blacks to be obese.",

      "title": "Children’s Essentialist Beliefs About Weight",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTStriking weight biases emerge early in development, yet cognitive-developmental research has largely ignored weight as a social characteristic of interest. How do children conceive of weight? In particular, do children hold essentialist views of weight (i.e. do they view weight as natural, stable, inductively meaningful, and reflective of people's insides) as they do of so many other social characteristics? We conducted an exploratory investigation of children's weight essentialism across two studies. In total, 356 participants (280 4- to 11-year-old children and 76 adults from the United States, mostly White and from middle- to high-income families) participated in three tasks, respectively assessing three dimensions of essentialism of social categories: Beliefs about weight stability, heritability, and inductive potential despite transformation. Results revealed that children viewed weight as stable (similarly so to race) and informative of someone's food choices, but they did not view it as biologically- or genetically-determined. Thus, children may not view weight as reflecting people's biological nature (biological essentialism), but they may view weight as reflecting people's stable personal character (moral essentialism) – a view which is also highly compatible with weight bias, unlike biological essentialism. Children also demonstrated stronger essentialist views of lightness than heaviness across tasks, though essentialism of heaviness increased over development. Findings are discussed as they relate to early conceptions of weight and weight bias. Implications for conceptualizations and measurement of essentialism are also discussed.KEYWORDS: Weightweight biasbiological essentialismsocial essentialismmoral essentialismchildren Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Data availability statementThe parents and guardians of the participants in this study did not consent for their children's data to be shared publicly, so the supporting data is not publicly available.Notes1 Recommendations for language used to refer to weight and body size are hugely diverse (see Meadows & Daníelsdóttir, Citation2016; Puhl, Citation2020). For example, some size-acceptance movements hope to reclaim the term \"fat\" and decouple it from its associated stigma (Saguy, Citation2013), while others strongly recommend against its use (Dutton et al., Citation2010). Ultimately, we chose \"weight\" as it is a value-neutral term that is considered unlikely to increase stigma (see Puhl, Citation2020), and \"heavy\" and \"light\" since they relate directly to weight and have been widely judged as acceptable (Dutton et al., Citation2010; Puhl, Citation2020).2 Further analyses of Race-Stability Scores are reported in the Supplemental Materials.3 When Adoption Task data were combined across Studies 1 and 2, data revealed a modest but significant tendency toward indicating that children would grow up to resemble their birthparents rather than their adoptive parents. We view this result as consistent with our interpretation that children hold moral essentialist, but not biological essentialist, views of weight: Recall that the task was designed to assess whether children view weight as determined by people's biology or by their environment – no other option was presented to them, including an option indicating that weight is determined by people's personal or moral character. Faced with such a choice, a child who holds a moral essentialist view of weight would be somewhat at a loss, but might pick the next-closest option, which is a biological essentialist view of weight. This is precisely what our results show. Children made this selection on 58% of trials in the combined dataset.",

      "abstract": "Human babies not only are reliable triggers of tender feelings and protective tendencies, they also happen to be exceptionally fat compared to the newborns of most other species. These two facts are used to formulate a hypothesis predicting that overweight males, due to their great physical resemblance to babies, not only are perceived as cute, but also are associated with negatively evaluated traits (e.g., immaturity, lack of willpower) that are saliently inconsistent with traits required for adults. In this study, a great many physical features of adult males varying widely in weight were measured and correlated with subjective judgements. Providing preliminary support for the hypothesis, it was found that the features that were correlated with objective and perceived fatness (e.g., circularity of body parts, relatively large head, short and thick neck) also correlated with perceived babyishness. Perceived fatness and babyishness had curvilinear influences on the positive and prosocial appraisal of cuteness, but were primarily negatively related to perceived willpower and beauty. Results are used to formulate an alternative evolutionary perspective on social responses to overweight and obese individuals, emphasizing the uniquely human adaptive value of fatness and the misfiring of the underlying response mechanism under modern conditions of living.",

Fatores culturais e sociais contribuem diretamente impondo padroes e modelos de corpos perfeitos a serem alcancados, uma vez que a imagem corporal esta relacionada com autoconfianca e satisfacao pessoal. Essa preocupacao de autoimagem corporal antigamente era presente em maior numero na rotina de mulheres, entretanto atualmente, estes cuidados tambem comecaram a abranger uma grande parcela do cotidiano masculino. Diante disso, houve uma maior procura destes individuos por academias de musculacao, devido este local proporcionar beneficios esteticos e contribuir em aspectos sociais. Quando esses cuidados ao corpo sao realizados em excesso acabam por vezes susceptiveis a desencadear transtornos corporais, como a vigorexia que e caracterizada pelos individuos se sentirem fracos, pequenos e insatisfeitos com suas formas fisicas independente do quao musculosos estejam. Mediante fatos, o objetivo geral desta pesquisa foi: Identificar em praticantes de musculacao o perfil antropometrico e o grau de severidade dos indicios de vigorexia. Metodologicamente este estudo foi realizado com 50 alunos de musculacao do sexo masculino, matriculados na Academia Equilibrio do Corpo, do municipio de Guarabira - Paraiba. Como instrumento para coleta de dados utilizou-se um questionario para avaliacao dos indicios de vigorexia, composto por 10 questoes fechadas e sua classificacao foi estabelecida a partir do somatorio de pontos assinalados para cada resposta. Para avaliacao do perfil antropometrico foi realizado o IMC e aferido as medidas de quatro dobras cutâneas para obtencao do percentual de gordura. Os resultados indicaram que na classificacao concernente aos indicios de vigorexia, oito individuos (14%) apresentaram severos indicios desse transtorno. No que corresponde a classificacao do estado nutricional a maior parcela de individuos (54%) foram classificados como sobrepeso. A media do percentual de gordura encontrado foi 13,25% estando classificada dentro do padrao adequado. Sendo assim, a partir desses resultados concluiu-se que, a vigorexia merece uma maior atencao, pois esta se tornando cada vez mais comum entre os jovens praticantes de musculacao e que o IMC pode nao ser um bom parâmetro para avaliar a composicao fisica destes atletas, ja que nao e capaz de deferir massa muscular de gordura corporea.",

      "title": "They’re Not Just Little Adults",
      "abstract": "Kids are really different from their adult counterparts! It is critical that physicians, coaches, physical therapists, and athletic trainers keep the features of growth and development in mind as athletes progress from childhood to adolescence. Children are not all the same and they don’t necessarily mature in the same way or at the same rate. Just take a freshman high school football team for instance: There may be a few teammates who shave, are well developed, and are ready to compete against juniors and seniors. They are likely close to their adult size, having already experienced their growth spurts. Others will probably be baby-faced—perhaps with peach fuzz on their chins. Their muscle development is still waiting for the blast of testosterone that will hasten their development. The weight and height differences between these groups may be substantial, thus raising the question, should they be competing against one another in a contact sport? Such are the issues of maturation sorting—a mixing bowl of factors complicated by hormones, genetics, nutrition, and environment.\r\n\r\nThe progressive musculoskeletal development that occurs between childhood and adolescence is fascinating but presents challenges for clinicians who care for those attempting to reach their maximum athletic potential. As we consider the consequences on the bone growth centers from the increased hours of training and the miles run, we realize that we do not have all the answers with which to reconcile optimal performance and growth. Many aches and pains that arise are minor concerns and so may reflect what previous generations of clinicians called “growing pains.” Some discomforts, though, should not be ignored and must be attended to properly to avoid more significant problems later. Such dilemmas are addressed by Lindenfeld et al and Purcell et al in this edition. Many sports injuries sustained by children and adolescents clearly demonstrate that there are limitations to what the growing skeleton can tolerate. Knowledge of these limitations should be part of the planning schedule for practice and training, especially in high-risk sports such as gymnastics and wrestling. Of particular concern are some of the conditions that affect the spine of young athletes. Whereas many adults suffer from low back pain (and a number use this condition for secondary gain), children, with rare exception, don’t malinger. Low back pain in children should always be taken seriously. Most cases involve mechanical or structural issues that can be successfully treated, especially if diagnosed early. All the more reason to pay special attention to such complaints in kids.\r\n\r\nIn addition to focusing on treating many of these musculoskeletal conditions, it is worthwhile to emphasize their prevention, as Sekiya et al and Zernicke et al do in this issue of Sports Health. Sekiya et al demonstrates the difficulty of changing the mind-set regarding unsafe weight loss practices in amateur wrestling. Although recent guideline and rule changes have helped, much more can be done to improve the health environment of wrestling.\r\n\r\nThe nutrition work by Zernicke et al is particularly interesting in light of what the typical American teenager ingests in high school cafeterias and fast-food outlets, making one wonder why teenagers don’t sustain hip fractures in their 20s.\r\n\r\nThe publications in this issue pose a challenge to those looking to improve the health of youngsters. By accepting this challenge, we hope to enhance the lives of this and future generations.",

      "abstract": "As many as 45% of transgender individuals experience gender-based victimisation (GBV), including physical and sexual violence; social, workplace, and housing discrimination; and family or social rejection. In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual’s gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income, and non-white race/ethnicity were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of U.S. adolescent and adult transgender persons (𝑛 = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.",

Given reported heteronormativity and weight-stigmatizing attitudes within dietetics, findings are highly relevant to dietitians. Participants described weight-centrism, microaggressions, and prejudice in healthcare, revealed a strong relational sense of identity and self, and recognized the need for advocacy. Ultimately, a radical ontological shift in dietetics may be necessary to eliminate the sense of exclusion that diverse, higher-weight individuals experience in healthcare settings.",

      "title": "Our stolen figures: The interface of sexual differentiation, endocrine disruptors, maternal programming, and energy balance",
      "abstract": "This article is part of a Special Issue \"Energy Balance\". The prevalence of adult obesity has risen markedly in the last quarter of the 20th century and has not been reversed in this century. Less well known is the fact that obesity prevalence has risen in domestic, laboratory, and feral animals, suggesting that all of these species have been exposed to obesogenic factors present in the environment. This review emphasizes interactions among three biological processes known to influence energy balance: Sexual differentiation, endocrine disruption, and maternal programming. Sexual dimorphisms include differences between males and females in body weight, adiposity, adipose tissue distribution, ingestive behavior, and the underlying neural circuits. These sexual dimorphisms are controlled by sex chromosomes, hormones that masculinize or feminize adult body weight during perinatal development, and hormones that act during later periods of development, such as puberty. Endocrine disruptors are natural and synthetic molecules that attenuate or block normal hormonal action during these same developmental periods. A growing body of research documents effects of endocrine disruptors on the differentiation of adipocytes and the central nervous system circuits that control food intake, energy expenditure, and adipose tissue storage. In parallel, interest has grown in epigenetic influences, including maternal programming, the process by which the mother's experience has permanent effects on energy-balancing traits in the offspring. This review highlights the points at which maternal programming, sexual differentiation, and endocrine disruption might dovetail to influence global changes in energy balancing traits.",

      "abstract": "There are a host of factors that influence the nutritional needs and nutrition intake of children. These factors can be categorized as being both biological and nonbiological. Biological factors include age, gender, growth, disease states, and genetic makeup. Among the nonbiological factors, socio-economic status is the most important. Poverty is one of the major socio-economic causes of variation in nutrient intake, and it also impacts nutrient requirements. Poverty imposes constraints to live in environments that are less food secure and that have greater potential health risks, including environmental contaminants such as lead, and other heavy metals. Parasites, especially hookworms, Schistosomes, malaria, cause blood loss, which increases nutrient needs. These parasites generally are more prevalent in poor environments. Socio-cultural factors, such as religion, food, and social status, also influence nutritional intake and needs. Religion and culture influence what people understand to be edible foods, what they eat, and as such has an impact on which nutrients are consumed and which nutrients may be needed in higher amounts (Cultural Foods, 2000).",

      "abstract": "Nourishment is a complex behaviour in which biochemical, psychological and sociocultural factors have an influence on it. Energy intake depends on the integration of two fundamentals factors: hanger and appetite. Each consumed food has different grades of capacity to cut the hanger out and to inhibit the beginning of a new intake. The kind of food, its cooking, consistency, volume and quantity of macronutrients represents a fundamental factor that is going to have an influence on food intake. Some nervious regions are involved in the regulation of food intake and they affect cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and brainstem. The control of hunger takes place in a central level and also it is regulated by different peripheral factors. The food and nutrient selection and intake are influenced by genetic factors, but environmental factors seem to have greater importance. Early positive or negative experiences with food influence also in food preferences, so repeated exposures increase children’s preference to a specific food or flavour. Individual and family eating habits are conditioned by their availability of food, their access to them and their learning. Certain cultural and religious traditions also have influence on their choice of food. The knowledge of nutrition does not ensure that people to adopt healthy eating behaviours, although the influence of food choices based on its effect on health seems more relevant in those people who have higher nutritional knowledge. Marketing, media and food advertising are a force that socializes and potentially affects the behaviour of what people eat. Sensory characteristics of food, smell and texture, affect food preferences and eating habits. Nourishment is converted in a complex behaviour in which different disciplines have a place by many factors that condition it. Addressing these factors will enable us a better understand the behaviour of individuals and extend the strategies in order to maintain and improve population health through nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Every child that is born with expectation of living and fulfilling life’s expectancy. The quality of life approach focuses on what is most important to every individual. However, each child is born with different challenges and peculiarity in the area of intellectual capacity. The condition could be present at birth as a congenital abnormality. An individual may be physically fit with no brain or body abnormalities and yet be mentally disabled. The terms mild, moderate, severe and profound are often used to classify intellectual disability. In view of this, it has been observed that poor motor control, high physical demand, fear of accident and social exclusion could limit the involvement of persons with intellectual disability in activities related to sport or physical activity. Therefore, it is needful to achieve social inclusion and quality of life for persons with intellectual disability through sports and physical activity.",

Valid criteria range from prevention of nutrient specific deficiencies on one extreme to maximal risk reduction for major diseases and maximal health promotion on the other. Requirements are expressed either as physiological or dietary. Physiological requirements relate to the amount of a nutrient available for absorption and utilization per day; the dietary requirement is the amount of the nutrient in the daily diet that furnishes the physiological requirement. The physiological requirement, in turn, can be expressed as the basal requirement, the amount that is adequate to maintain all physiologically important functions, or the normative requirement. Measurements of the metabolism of a trace element can give valuable information relating to requirements when properly interpreted. Metabolic balance studies have been widely used in past with the assumption that any intake that results in negative balance must ultimately result in deficiency.",

In general, the data presented here suggest that that anything signalling potential adverse conditions later in life, such as high levels of stress or low levels of food availability, will lead to alterations in the offspring, possibly of an epigenetic nature, preparing the offspring for these conditions later in life. However, when similar environmental conditions are not met in adulthood, these alterations may have maladaptive consequences, resulting in obesity and heightened stress sensitivity. The data also suggest that the mechanism underlying these adult phenotypes might be dependent on the type and the timing of exposure.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe sharp increase in obesity prevalence has led to its classification as an international crisis and the number one health epidemic in the United States. Along with implications to physical health, obesity often carries a stigma that negatively impacts the social, emotional, and psychological functioning of those who are overweight or perceive themselves as overweight. This stigma is pervasive throughout our culture, and is evident at different levels across lines of gender, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Although leisure research has insufficiently addressed the topic of obesity-stigma, some general constraints and stigma-based studies reinforce many of the concepts raised in obesity-stigma research. Presented information suggests the relevance of obesity-stigma as a significant leisure constraint.

Existen varios mitos y estereotipos en torno a la sexualidad de las personas con discapacidad; la misma gente es capaz de mermar drásticamente la expresión sexual de estas personas, como pensar que son asexuales y que dependen de los demás. También existe una devaluación de la percepción corporal que dificulta apreciarse como un sujeto sexualmente atractivo. A esto se suman otros factores que pueden ser considerados un obstáculo para la vida sexual, como el dolor, el uso de fármacos, incontinencia urinaria o fecal, la dificultad para adoptar ciertas posiciones para realizar el coito e incluso el temor a la muerte. Es indudable que la vida sexual de las personas discapacitadas tiene una especificidad, bien en sí misma, bien por las condiciones en que pueden vivirla.

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

      "abstract": "Environments erode health by shaping biologically based goal systems, or adaptive strivings, that help a brain regulate bodily energy resources. Adaptive strivings let predictive brain processes anticipate and meet even modest shifts in impending metabolic demands. Adaptive strivings serve growth, social potency, and safety. Striving for personal and social growth (transcendence striving) improves energy regulation and promotes health. But adverse environments can foster precarious strivings that cause organic damage even in the absence of fight-flight responses or distressing emotions: Agonistic striving (persistently seeking to influence others) and dissipated striving (disengaging to be safe) impair regulation and foster illness by generating perpetual power contests or perceptions of self-inefficacy. Threats to social power or status endanger health by inducing precarious strivings that amplify adversities. Emotional transcendence striving, however, may dampen harsh health impacts. Research has replicated the three strivings across differences of race, sex, and age and indicates that agonistic striving contributes to hypertension, somatic symptoms, and alcohol use disorders. Harmful health effects of agonistic striving are moderated by emotional transcendence striving indexed by the ability to modulate anger or physical pain. Agonistic striving mediates the association between exposure to neighborhood disorder and hypertension after controlling for negative emotions and disease-prone traits.",

      "abstract": "<italic>[This is an advance summary of a forthcoming article in the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Food Studies. Please check back later for the full article.]</italic> Research into the social and cultural dimensions of body size has been rapidly growing, including within the interdisciplinary field of fat studies. Fat studies scholars contest and critique mainstream ideas about body size or weight, including the view that “obesity” is fundamentally pathological or inherently unhealthy, or that individuals can control their body size. Researchers have also challenged negative stereotypes and highlighted the harms of moralizing and stigmatizing discourses about larger bodies. Research within this area often draws upon ideas produced within fat liberation activist movements, including rejecting the term “obesity” as overly medicalizing and pathologizing, and instead reclaiming “fat” and “fatness” as neutral descriptors. Research has identified and characterized the pervasiveness of anti-fatness (weight stigma, or anti-fat discrimination) within and across societies. Anti-fatness has interpersonal and structural dimensions, both of which can have far-reaching effects on fat people’s lives, including effects on health outcomes. Scholars have traced the historical emergence of anti-fatness, the connection between anti-fatness and racial hierarchy, and the ways in which anti-fatness contributes to the moralization of food and the prevalence of dieting practices. Additionally, policies and clinical guidelines developed to address the “obesity epidemic,” such as calorie labeling and the use of body mass index (BMI), have been a target of critical examination. Researchers have suggested that these interventions can function as potentially harmful practices of control and surveillance that reinforce anti-fat attitudes and structures. Similarly, frameworks and understandings of food environments, food justice, and health have been evaluated in terms of the ways in which these discourses can continue to problematize fat bodies and contribute to discrimination or marginalization. There has been increasing recognition of the harms of anti-fatness in fields such as public health, which has led to attempts to move away from stigmatizing language and interventions, and to reject placing responsibility on individuals. However, these attempts have been criticized for continuing to medicalize and pathologize fatness, and therefore continuing to perpetuate harm. As the language and policies around “obesity” or fatness shift, in part driven by the introduction of novel weight-loss interventions such as Ozempic, research into social attitudes toward fatness and the experiences of people with larger bodies continues to evolve.",

      "abstract": "The modification of ageing by nutritional intervention is well recognised. Post-weaning diet restriction is the only widely reproducible method to slow ageing, but the effects of prenatal and preweaning diet restriction have been less well characterised. There is some evidence that diet restriction instituted in utero or shortly after birth may have an opposite effect and be associated with increased ageing, and recent work suggests that it may shorten lifespan. Interest in this area has been rekindled by the growing body of epidemiological evidence showing that a number of age-related diseases are associated with poor growth and inadequate nutrition in early life. The relevance of this association to structural and functional ageing changes in different systems is now being considered. Work on musculo-skeletal ageing has demonstrated that loss of muscle strength and bone mass is greater in individuals who did not grow well in early life, and a range of studies suggests that maternal, developmental and nutritional factors are important. The underlying mechanisms remain speculative, and it remains to be determined whether they are system-specific or universal throughout the body. A new cohort of subjects aged between 60 and 70 years is being established to investigate how genetic factors interact with growth and nutritional influences to programme musculo-skeletal ageing in later life.",

      "abstract": "It is widely agreed that fecundity selection and sexual selection are the major evolutionary forces that select for larger body size in most organisms. The general, equilibrium view is that selection for large body size is eventually counterbalanced by opposing selective forces. While the evidence for selection favoring larger body size is overwhelming, counterbalancing selection favoring small body size is often masked by the good condition of the larger organism and is therefore less obvious. The suggested costs of large size are: (1) viability costs in juveniles due to long development and/or fast growth; (2) viability costs in adults and juveniles due to predation, parasitism, or starvation because of reduced agility, increased detectability, higher energy requirements, heat stress, and/or intrinsic costs of reproduction; (3) decreased mating success of large males due to reduced agility and/or high energy requirements; and (4) decreased reproductive success of large females and males due to late reproduction. A review of the literature indicates a substantial lack of empirical evidence for these various mechanisms and highlights the need for experimental studies that specifically address the fitness costs of being large at the ecological, physiological, and genetic levels. Specifically, theoretical investigations and comprehensive case studies of particular model species are needed to elucidate whether sporadic selection in time and space is sufficient to counterbalance perpetual and strong selection for large body size.",

      "abstract": "People have asked me if their body fatness is genetic, to which I reply unhelpfully, yes and no. There is a very tiny proportion of any population that very easily puts on weight, where a small number of genes relate to, or are implicated in, excessive weight gain. There is a larger group of people with several genes that are triggered by one or several of a range of environmental factors to gain body fatness. And then there is almost everyone else, each person with thousands of genetic variants that have seemingly small individual effects in relation to obesity under circumstances that favour it. There are also those annoying people who can eat as much as they want, of anything they want, and not put on weight, seemingly with genes for thinness. The study of obesity genetics is steadily letting the genie out of the bottle – once you know something, you can't unknow it, and we know enough about this area now to be able to reply with 'It depends', when someone says, 'My body fatness is down to my genes.'",

Although attitudes towards obesity are shaped by age, gender and cultural background, negative attitudes are pervasive. These anti-fat attitudes lead to assumptions about the character and psychological state of obese people and are linked, in turn, to prevailing Western attitudes about responsibility and blame. Our portrayal of obesity, understanding of its causes and approaches to treatment need to acknowledge properly the influence of an obesogenic environment, and not be based on a misconceived notion of will power.",

      "abstract": "Drug misuse and juvenile delinquency share overlapping aetiologies that are complex and multifaceted and include parental, social, psychological, environmental, and economic aspects. Initiation, maintenance, and even escalation of drug use and criminal behaviour in an individual are heavily influenced by social factors like culture, neighbourhood, and family. Juvenile delinquency can be influenced and sustained by factors such as family structure and functioning, broken homes, absent or unsatisfactory interpersonal relationships, unbalanced parenting, lack of guidance, economic instability, substance abuse or addiction in the family or among peers, access to addictive substances, exposure to physical, sexual, emotional abuse or trauma violence, and peer pressure. Psychological factors that can result in drug use and criminal behaviour include high stress, personality traits like high impulsivity or sensation seeking, depression, and anxiety. People who develop substance use disorders have excessive dependencies, which may initially be reinforced because they lower stress and lift spirits. The belief that drugs can provide solace and help lift one above all misery, which underlies continued drug use, is associated with this reduction. There has also been evidence of an association between early violent behaviour, impulsivity, and problems with concentration or attention.",

      "title": "Weight Labeling and Obesity",
      "abstract": "Letters RESEARCH LETTER Weight Labeling and Obesity: A Longitudinal Study of Girls Aged 10 to 19 Years Anti-obesity efforts that rely on stigmatizing weight (eg, using harsh language or stereotypical portrayals of over- weight individuals) may impede health promotion efforts, as weight stigma is often negatively related to behavior change and thus seems unlikely to result in weight loss. 1 Indeed, considerable research underscores the detrimental effects of weight stigma on the physical health and well-being of chil- dren and adolescents, 2 and nationally representative, longi- tudinal data show weight-based discrimination is associated with weight gain among older individuals. 3 Although the childhood weight stigma literature frequently examines overt and often malicious behaviors (eg, bullying), stigma pro- cesses can begin when an individual experiences weight labeling. 4 By labeling someone as overweight, the negative stereotypes, status loss, and mistreatment associated with this label may now be applicable to the individual. Recent research suggests that the negative psychological effects of weight stigma can begin when one is simply labeled as “too fat” by others. 5 However, the relationship between weight labeling and weight gain remains unknown. Thus, we exam- ined if weight labeling during childhood was related to the likelihood of having an obese body mass index (BMI) nearly a decade later. Methods | Sample . The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti- tute Growth and Health Study followed up girls who self- identified as black (n = 1213) or white (n = 1166) from age 10 years until age 19 years. Extensive study information is avail- able at https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/static/studies/nghs /Protocol.pdf. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study protocol was approved by institu- tional review boards at all 3 sites (University of California, Berkeley; University of Cincinnati; and Westat/Group Health Association, Rockville, Maryland). The University of Califor- nia, Los Angeles Institutional Review Board provided human subjects approval for the current study. The child provided writ- ten assent and a parent/guardian provided written informed consent until the child became 18 years old, at which point she provided written informed consent. Measures. A parent or guardian provided income and educa- tion information at baseline. Certified staff conducted anthro- pometry and collected information on pubertal timing and weight labeling. Weight labeling was assessed by asking par- ticipants, “Have any of these people told you that you were too fat?” followed by a list that included father, mother, brother, sister, best girlfriend, boy you like best, any other girl, any other boy, and teacher. Participants reporting “yes” to any item were considered “labeled.” Results | Participants without BMI data at age 19 years (n = 317) were excluded from analyses. These participants did not dif- fer in baseline BMI, weight labeling, or race but had slightly lower levels of household income and parental education. At baseline, 57.9% (n = 1188) of participants reported being la- beled. Black girls reported more weight labeling than white girls (χ 21 = 16.13, P < .001), although this difference was small (φ = 0.089). Baseline BMI and weight labeling status were mod- erately correlated (r = 0.41, P < .001). Logistic regression analy- ses (Table) evaluated the association between baseline label- ing and obesity 10 years later. Adjusting for baseline BMI, household income, parental education, race, and age at men- arche, being labeled “too fat” at age 10 years remained a sig- nificant predictor of obesity at age 19 years (odds ra- tio = 1.66). The odds ratio was 1.62 when family members were the source of labeling and 1.40 when nonfamily members were the source. These effects were not modulated by race. Discussion | Being labeled “too fat” in childhood was associ- ated with higher odds of having an obese BMI nearly a decade later. Importantly, this relationship was independent of ini- tial BMI and thus not attributable simply to participants’ ob- jective weight at baseline. These data provide novel evidence that the relationship between weight stigma and weight gain may begin early in life; these findings also demonstrate that this relationship can emerge even for a seemingly innocuous Table.

      "title": "Identity‐Based Motivation: Implications for Health and Health Disparities",
      "abstract": "People aspire to be healthy but often fall short of this goal. Poor health is associated with macro‐level factors—social stratification and low socioeconomic position, including low education, low income, and low status racial‐ethnic group membership. These social determinants differentially expose people to health‐promoting (or undermining) contexts and to having (not having) choice and control over their lives. But social determinants cannot cause individual action directly. Identity‐based motivation theory addresses this gap, articulating how social determinants operate at the micro‐level to influence whether or not a behavior or choice feels congruent with important identities and how such identity‐congruence, in turn, influences which strategies are chosen and how difficulty is interpreted. Lack of choice and control make an interpretation of difficulty as meaning that effort is pointless and “not for people like me” (rather than important) more likely, reducing belief that one's action and effort matter.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the contributions of sensory function, appetitive sensations, ingestive patterns, and dietary macronutrient content to the control of energy intake, which is the primary driver of weight gain and loss in humans. Thresholds for and intensity ratings of sensory stimuli are weakly associated with hedonic impressions. Liking of foods is more strongly related to food choice but still provides only weak predictive power. Due to numerous environmental and biological factors that promote or constrain intake, no robust relationship between appetitive sensations and obesity has emerged. Increased eating frequency generally promotes greater energy intake, but effects on body weight are less well-documented, potentially due to misreporting of intake. The energy content of the diet is a better predictor of weight status than its particular macronutrient distribution. From these studies, we conclude that human feeding is a complex behavior that reflects the contributions of multiple drivers. No single input provides a reliable index of an individual's or population's energy balance. The importance of each will be determined by an individual's lifestyle and biology, thus requiring individualized recommendations to affect body weight in a desired direction.",

      "abstract": "Background: Senescence is the deterioration of the body’s biological and physiological function throughout later life. Senescent populations are more prone to diseases, though other than osteoporosis, skeletal senescence is a less discussed topic in Indonesia. Furthermore, a global and national increase in the aging population showed that they will be a major group in society, thus raising the urgency to review this matter. This study aims to comprehend the physiological and biomechanical mechanisms of skeletal senescence, as well as senescent variations in a certain sex or population affinity. Literature Review: Age-related skeletal cellular death and imbalance contribute to bone damage in elders. Senescence also affects skeletal biomechanics, expressed in increased bone porosity and brittleness. Stresses in aged bone risk straining above its elastic limit and causing fractures due to its inability to tolerate stresses. The loss of sex hormones is related to skeletal senescence, especially in females, though the effects of testosterone on skeletal senescence are underresearched. Dietary change, estrogen replacement therapy, and calcitonin consumption are effective measures in reducing the effects of osteoporosis. Variations were found in the bone aging process in different populations, especially regarding bone mineral density loss in white, African-American, Asian, and Hispanic populations. Summary: Specific population-based healthcare services in geriatrics and gerontology are highly suggested to ensure inclusive healthcare for every aged individual. Due to the minimum data about bone aging in Indonesia (other than osteoporosis), the authors encourage data procurement on local populations to create more suitable medical guidelines for elders in Indonesia.",

Responding to limitations of existing evidence, Jane Wardle in 2005 argued for a 'myth of psychological maladjustment'. This review looks again at self-esteem. The different characterisations of self-esteem each offer value. Global self-esteem is reduced in nearly all studies of youth with obesity. Dimensional self-esteem reveals physical appearance, athletic and social competence as the most affected areas, confirmed by research that has operationalised low self-competence. Children with obesity are also more likely to be victimised by their peers, generally and for their fatness. Victims who bully others appear to preserve some aspects of self-esteem. A relatively small proportion of youth with obesity has low self-esteem, but those with severe and persistent obesity are especially compromised. Weight loss is only weakly associated with improved self-competence suggesting the value of resilience and asset approaches to improving well-being.",

It impacts the biopsychosocial health of adolescents in numerous ways including reducing opportunities for education and shelter; directly affecting cognitive and emotional processes; diminishing opportunities for healthy food, exercise, and sleep; and increasing exposure to violence. Structural racism is a driver of adolescent obesity through housing segregation that may limit food and exercise choices. A perception of discrimination among Latino adolescents has been associated with recent and lifetime use of substances. And social media platforms have been vehicles of online vicarious and individual racial discrimination against adolescents. Racism is a significant public health problem that should be dismantled.

Thus, they are an important focus for intervention to promote attitudinal and behavioral change. In her early theoretical work, Hilde Bruch argued that anorexia nervosa (AN) is caused by the failure to develop a diverse set of identities or self-definitions.1, 2 Highly controlling and perfectionistic parenting was believed to limit the child’s opportunities to function autonomously and to interfere with development of a clear and richly elaborated self. Bruch suggested that the adolescent turns to body weight as a viable source of selfdefinition and as a means of compensating for the lack of a clear identity and for associated feelings of powerlessness and incompetence. From this perspective, the adolescent’s fixation on body weight and exaggerated desire to be thin are a maladaptive way of coping with identity deficits and of striving for a sense of self-definition, competence, and control.",

      "title": "Principles of Growth Assessment",
      "abstract": "Growth in children is usually steady and predictable, and good references are available for assessment and comparison. Growth reflects changes in the mass of body tissues (muscle, fat, and bone), with differences in maturation and body composition between boys and girls. Growth is a key component of nutritional status and indicator of health and well-being for the individual and in populations, with every aspect of a child's health being affected by his or her nutritional status. Growth can be measured objectively by using various anthropometric measurements and is universally part of any pediatric care.Typically, weight is measured by using scales, infantometer (length board), stadiometer (stature) for linear growth, calipers for skinfold measurements, and nonstretchable tape for head and arm or other circumferences. Recumbent length is referenced through age 3 years, stature from 2 to 20 years, and head circumference from birth to age 3 years.Although infancy and adolescence are characterized by rapid growth, growth occurs in spurts, with rapid growth followed by slower growth. Stunting or faltering of linear growth reflects both a decrease in the number of spurts and the height of these spurts and can begin in utero.Growth generally is divided into four periods: 1) infancy to 2 years of age, 2) preschool years (2 to 6 years), 3) middle childhood years (7 to 10 years), and 4) adolescence (11 to 20 years). These growth periods encompass changes in body composition as well as maturational milestones. During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, both cell number and cell size increase. Body composition changes significantly from infancy to adolescence in terms of absolute and relative changes in the amount of lipid, protein, water, and minerals. Skinfold measurements provide information on body composition that reflects nutritional stores, including lean body mass (muscle and water), lipid (energy stores), and bone (calcium and other minerals).Selecting the correct growth chart for sex, age, and measurement device is essential to the assessment. Revised growth charts were published in May 2000 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). They replace the 1977 NCHS charts and reflect large samples of healthy children living in the United States. These charts are available electronically (see Web site in references). The CDC-2000 infant charts are based on monthly (not quarterly) measurements, mixed races, and breast- and formula-fed infants. Growth measurements of an individual are compared with reference data for height/length, weight, and head circumference for age and sex, weight for height, and a new feature, body mass index (BMI). The BMI is calculated from the formula weight (kg)/height2 (M) and is designed for clinical use for children ages 2 to 20 years. The objective of the BMI percentiles is to assist in screening for overweight and identification of underweight, making the BMI a screening tool to identify risk.Growth charts do not reflect genetic potential or environmental factors and are inappropriate for preterm infants or children who have genetic disorders. Because no single measure defines an individual, children of unusual size (>95th percentile or <5th percentile) require further investigation to determine whether there is a growth problem. Additional care must be used when assessing smaller children because they appear to be more underweight than the 1977 charts indicate.Anthropometric measurements are inexpensive, noninvasive, and fast and reflect both short- and long-term nutrition status. The accuracy of measurements is an essential component of the assessment. Erroneous weight or linear measurements can place a child in an incorrect category, resulting in misinterpretation of growth parameters. Anthropometric measurements are objective, but growth characterization must be interpreted in the context of clinical assessment.The average weight at birth is slightly higher (3.4 kg for girls; 3.8 kg for boys) on the revised CDC-2000 growth charts. Healthy neonates are expected to regain their birthweight within 8 to 10 days after birth; a weight loss of 5% is within the norm for formula-fed infants. A weight loss of 7% is not unusual for a breastfed infant, but if it occurs during the first 72 hours after birth, an evaluation and review of the mother-infant dyad is needed, and any impediments must be addressed immediately. A weight loss of 10% from birthweight is the maximum acceptable loss; additional loss is a potential emergency. Greater weight loss among breastfed infants has been associated with the use of additional water or forced fluids that impede the breastfeeding process. The average infant (at the 50th percentile on the new growth chart) doubles his or her birthweight at 5 months, triples the birthweight at 14 to 15 months (200% increase), and quadruples birthweight around 3 years of age. Body length increases by more than 50% in the first postnatal year and doubles by 3 to 4 years of age. Head circumference increases by almost 30% in the first postnatal year. Increased head circumference indirectly suggests brain growth and is of great importance during the first year after birth, with the head expected to increase an average of 10 cm in circumference. Faltering growth in head circumference may suggest problems of brain growth or severe extended malnutrition. Growth and developmental changes occur during this time and are related to nutritional status.Measuring the length of an infant requires two people who have received training and can hold the child properly on the infantometer. The infantometer must be attached securely to a table and have a fixed headboard, moveable footboard, and rule or reader. The child's head should be held with the crown against the headboard so that the external auditory meatus and the lower margin of the eye are aligned perpendicularly. The other measurer gently stretches the infant's legs by holding both ankles with one hand while moving the footboard to meet the infant's heels flatly and perpendicularly. Before the final reading is made, the infant's knees are pressed gently against the board, and length is measured to the nearest 0.1 cm. This is not an easy measurement to obtain accurately because the infant often is objecting during the process.Stature (standing height) is measured by using a stadiometer or similar apparatus. The child must be able to stand erect, with heels, buttocks, shoulders, and head all simultaneously touching the measuring board. The child's feet must be at a 90-degree angle, the axis of vision horizontal, and the head in a Frankfurt plane and parallel to the floor. Children should stare straight ahead and stand tall while keeping their heels on the floor. The headboard of the apparatus is slid down firmly on the crown and height recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.Weight can be measured on infant scales, beam balances scales, electronic scales, and readout scales. Regardless of the type, all scales require regular calibration to ensure accurate weight. Infants always should be weighed nude (no diaper); children should be weighed without their shoes and outer clothing. Weight should be recorded to the nearest 0.01 kg for infants and 0.1 kg for children.Because head circumference reflects the particularly rapid brain growth of the first 3 years after birth, growth curves for head circumferences customarily are charted through age 3 years. Infants who have microcephalic or macrocephalic conditions require different monitoring of their head growth and the use of specialized charts.Arm circumference and skinfold measurements can provide information on body composition that cannot be attained from weight and length/stature measurements. However, making such measurements requires training and proper technique to avoid significant intraobserver difference. Skinfold can be measured at the triceps, biceps, and at subscapular and suprailiac sites. The triceps skinfold is a good indicator of energy reserves, correlates well with total body fat stores, reflects short-term fluctuations, and can be compared with excellent reference data. Subscapular skinfold is less sensitive to short-term fluctuations but better reflects long-term energy stores. A combination of skinfold measurements can be used to estimate the percent body fat and lean body mass by using prediction equations. The mid-upper arm circumference reflects muscle, fat, and bone, providing a rapid index of malnutrition, especially if height and weight are unavailable, and is well referenced.Comment: The new growth charts are easily downloaded from the previously noted Web site. Of note, growth charts that were downloaded from the site from October 16, 2000 to November 21, 2000 need to be replaced with the most recent chart because of some scaling errors. So, what's new about the new growth charts? First, the data are most representative of the population of children in the United States. Second, the age range of the charts extends beyond 18 years to 20 years of age. Third, the percentile values go beyond the 5th and 95th percentiles and include the 3rd and 97th percentiles. Finally, BMI charts are included. BMI values are correlated with total body fat, percentage body fat, and fat-free mass. High BMIs due to obesity in children have been associated with increased blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In adulthood, high BMIs have been related to increased morbidity and mortality. In adults, a BMI greater than 25 indicates overweight and greater than 30 indicates obesity. For children, cutoff values of concern are not well established, but recommendations for evaluation and interventions have been made at certain percentiles. BMI curves, however, allow monitoring of growth patterns that may indicate risk for over- or underweight at an early age.",

Ability to perform specific functions improves for some and deteriorates for others. In addition, many individuals experience both types of functioning change at the same time—improvement in the ability to perform some functions and deterioration in ability to perform others. The covariates of functional improvement differ from those of functional loss. The return to functioning is most likely to occur when the overall functional status of the individual is higher, when the loss has been recent, and when the impairment is not severe. Decline in ability to perform specific functions is more likely when general health and functioning levels are lower and when a person has had a stroke, has arthritis, or has visual or auditory impairment. Age, race, and sex are related to the likelihood that functioning will deteriorate, but they have little effect on the likelihood of improvement.",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‐11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

      "abstract": "Abstract Child sexual abuse is typically defined as any sort of sexual contact between a child and an adult (or significantly older teenager), including sexual solicitation of, or exposure to, a child by an older person. It may include unwanted and inappropriate physical contact with the child's genitals; sexual touching, manipulation, or fondling; penetration in terms of vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse or attempted intercourse; as well as exposing children to sexual images or forcing them to watch pornography or to witness adult sexual acts. Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‐term psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‐esteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

      "abstract": "Nella stesura di questa tesi, si sono utilizzati i termini menomazione, disabilita ed handicap considerando la definizione fornita dall'Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanita.\r\n Menomazione: Qualsiasi perdita o anormalita a carico di una struttura o di una funzione psicologica, fisiologica o anatomica.\r\n Disabilita: qualsiasi limitazione o perdita (conseguente a menomazione) della capacita di compiere un'attivita nel modo o nell'ampiezza considerati normali un essere umano.\r\n Handicap: condizione di svantaggio conseguente a una menomazione o a una disabilita che in un certo soggetto limita o impedisce l'adempimento dei ruolo normale in relazione all'eta, sesso e fattori socio\r\n culturali.\r\n Facendo riferimento alla definizione di Handicap come condizione di svantaggio, bisogna sottolineare come gli oggetti e l'ambiente stesso che ci circonda, tramite una pessima o ottima progettazione, possano peggiorare o migliorare le condizioni di vita delle persone, indipendentemente dalla foro condizione fisica. E' infatti dovuta ai fattori socio\r\n culturali non propriamente positivi la presenza della maggior parte delle barriere che oggi impediscono la completa godibilita dell'ambiente (domestico e non) alla totalita delle persone.\r\n Chiaramente, il problema e di maturazione culturale, di avere la sensibilita non solo all'inserimento sociale dell' handicappato, ma anche di essere consapevoli dei diritto di questi a non subire discriminazioni legate al proprio stato. Nell'anno 2000 non e purtroppo difficile trovare sui quotidiani casi di intolleranza o di insofferenza verso queste persone: casi in cui, ad esempio, la persona handicappata, a causa dei parere contrario dei condominio, non riesce ad ottenere (od ottiene con grandi difficolta) l'installazione di un ascensore o di un servoscala, poiche rovinerebbe l'immagine, oppure casi di albergatori che non riescono a far occupare dalle persone senza disabilita fisiche le camere con bagni accessibili a tutti. Le stesse aziende produttrici fanno molta attenzione al modo in cui proporre prodotti accessibili a tutti paura di farli ricadere nella sottofascia per handicappati.\r\n E' pero altrettanto doveroso sottolineare come il diritto di fruire completamente dei luoghi e dei contesto in cui si vive, e espressamente previsto dall'ART. 3 della Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana, che recita: Tutti i cittadini hanno pari dignita sociale e sono eguali davanti alla legge, senza distinzioni di sesso, di razza, di lingua, di religione, di opinioni politiche, di condizioni personali e sociali.\r\n E' compito della repubblica rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e sociale, che limitando di fatto le liberta e l'eguaglianza dei cittadini, impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana e l'effettiva partecipazione di tutti i lavoratori all'organizzazione politica, economica e sociale dei Paese. \r\n E' stata ritenuta utile una tesi di laurea su questo tema dopo aver riscontrato le grandi difficolta che i disabili devono superare nell'ambiente abitativo, sia quanto riguarda l'autonomia, sia la qualita della vita, in cui tutto e pensato unicamente con criteri ergonomici utenti non disabili.\r\n Gli ambienti domestici in cui si verificano le maggiori difficolta sono la cucina e il bagno. E' stato analizzato l'ambiente della cucina perche il bagno esistono diverse soluzioni progettuali.\r\n La tesi e stata sviluppata in due parti, una parte di ricerca, che ha fornito il sistema\r\n delle prestazioni richieste ed una di progetto, che ha soddisfatto le prestazioni\r\n richieste che si ritenevano prioritarie.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni richieste: sono state analizzate le esigenze emerse\r\n dall'intero sistema d'utenza e sono state illustrate tramite una sezione esplicativa\r\n accompagnata da degli elaborati grafici. In dettaglio:\r\n -Le complessita relative ai diversi tipi di utenza: l'utenza d'uso, di produzione, di\r\n gestione e sociale\r\n -Gli ausili necessari agli utenti disabili la deambulazione\r\n -I dati antropometrici degli utenti d'uso\r\n -Le tipologie ambientali ricorrenti in cucina\r\n -Le attrezzature indispensabili in cucina\r\n -Il lavoro che in cucina e necessario compiere durante la preparazione dei pasti.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite: il progetto\r\n -Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite si e tradotto, tramite alcuni elaborati grafici, in\r\n un prodotto di produzione industriale:\r\n una postazione che permette la preparazione dei cibi e il lavaggio delle\r\n stoviglie, con caratteristiche di flessibilita di installazione e di componenti,\r\n che permette l'utilizzo sia ad utenti disabili che ad utenti con mobilita non\r\n compromessa.\r\n Sulla base dei risultati della ricerca delle prestazioni richieste, eseguita nell'anno\r\n 1999, e stato sviluppato un progetto preliminare, costituito da elaborati grafici e\r\n tridimensionali che rappresentavano i vincoli e le prestazioni a cui il progetto doveva\r\n rispondere. Nel mese di gennaio 2000 e stato proposto a FRANKE S.p.A., nella\r\n persona dei Dott. Zeno Fontana, una collaborazione nello sviluppo industriale del\r\n progetto preliminare, che ha avuto la durata di circa un anno (gennaio- dicembre 2000) e che ha portato alla realizzazione di un prototipo ligneo in scala 1:1.",

With the rapid growth in height that occurs in adolescence, all the earlier faults are made more apparent, even when they are not greatly increased in actual physical proportions.

This increased awareness of parents is based on many factors: the child's appearance in the more formal clothing demanded by his increasing social life; his greatly increased size, with the corresponding increase in any deformity which he may have; his lack of skill in managing his suddenly enlarged body and its members, and, most of all, their startled realization that the child can no longer be counted on to outgrow his undesirable physical traits and that these, in fact,",

Neither does gender, at least not if social responsibility is controlled for. Age on the other hand seems of more interest and also diurnal type, but the two seem closely related. However, the major determinants of shift work tolerance probably have more to do with states or rather ways of coping with irregular work hours. Thus, the way an individual organizes his behavior to promote sleep may be of importance, as may be the need for sleep. This may be related to commitment to night work, avoiding light after night work, etc. One should probably give priority to teaching sleep/wake optimization, rather than trying to find individuals with particular traits. One gets the feeling that the highly tolerant single night shift worker would be older, have a low need for sleep, have a high sleep quality, be in good physical shape, and plan sleep strategically (using naps). If several night shifts occur in sequence, younger individuals may have an advantage.",

Less is known about the overall vicissitudes within and interactions between normal healthy and exceptional forms of narcissism and how they contrast or interweave in an individual with depreciated or pathological narcissism. Likewise, the importance of normal narcissistic functioning for individual mental health and capacity to live an optimal life has mostly been taken for granted. Healthy narcissistic functions, such as a sense of the right to one’s own life, striving for the best in life, appreciation of health and beauty, and ability to compete as well as to protect and defend oneself, are usually first attended to when they are absent or noticed as extreme. Nevertheless, healthy narcissism plays a crucial role in the human capacity to manage challenges, successes, and changes; to overcome defeats, illnesses, trauma, and losses; to love and be productive and creative; and to experience happiness, satisfaction, and acceptance of the course of one’s life.",

      "abstract": "It is well established that children and adolescents with learning disabilities are more likely to experience depressed mood than are their peers. Many scholars explain this relationship as resulting from low selfesteem, stress, or social isolation. However, little work has explored whether this relationship continues to exist into young adulthood. Using longitudinal data from national data, this study finds that young adults with physical and learning disabilities have higher levels of depression than do young adults who are not disabled. In almost every case, this relationship persists no matter the levels of self-esteem, self-perception and stress experienced by young adults with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Cada vez nacen más gemelos con discordancia de peso intrapar, factor de riesgo que puede afectar su desarrollo, especialmente el del hermano de menor peso intrapar. Sin embargo, pocos estudios abordan sus posibles disfunciones más allá de las obstétricas; de modo que el conocimiento acerca de las consecuencias de la discordancia de peso intrapar en su desarrollo psicológico es escaso. Este trabajo revisa la literatura y recapitula las consecuencias de la discordancia de peso intrapar en el desarrollo psicológico de los gemelos de menor peso intrapar, comparativamente a sus hermanos de más peso, así como la perdurabilidad de dichas consecuencias durante su ciclo vital. La literatura revisada muestra que los gemelos de menor peso intrapar obtienen puntuaciones inferiores a sus hermanos en habilidades cognitivas, verbales y psicomotoras; y mayor probabilidad de presentar rasgos asociados al desarrollo de hiperactividad. Estas diferencias persisten desde la infancia hasta la juventud, no existiendo datos referidos a la edad adulta. En conclusión, las consecuencias de la discordancia de peso intrapar sobre el desarrollo psicológico de los gemelos de menor peso intrapar son extensas tanto en las dimensiones afectadas como en su perdurabilidad. Es necesaria una mayor investigación que permita diseñar intervenciones tempranas preventivas y optimizadoras del desarrollo de estos niños; pues el óptimo desarrollo de todos los niños es la base de una sociedad en continuo progreso.",

      "abstract": "Growth assessment forms the basis of the management of endocrine disorders in childhood. However, it is important to emphasize that there is no clear demarcation between normal and abnormal stature and that an understanding of the various components of growth and its endocrine correlate is a basis of the logical investigations and the eventual diagnosis of growth disorders. In this context it is obvious that the definition of a tall or a short child is arbitrary. In fact, normal growth embodies many normal variants, not only terms of growing within or outside the percentiles, but also in terms of skeletal maturation and duration of puberty. It is worth reinterating that percentiles mean nothing more than the proportion of children who had reached given heights at given ages when they, the standardizing population, were measured. Therefore, percentile position in itself is of no consequence in the diagnosis or management of an individual child. To estimate the rate at which a child is growing, it is necessary to measure height on more than one occasion over a not too short period of time and to divide the increment in height by the time elapsed. As the growth of a normal child tends to follow a particular percentile an endocrine investigation becomes only necessary if a child is growing extremely quickly or slowly and if a significant deviation from the percentile lines becomes apparent.",

This study found that emotional distress toward goal achievement failure mediated the influence of ethnicity on perceived self-efficacy in resisting eating temptations. White females reporting higher emotional distress about weight gain than their black counterparts displayed lower self-regulatory efficacy, particularly when negative emotions were involved. Negative attitudes toward goal achievement failure among whites played a critical role in undermining perceived self-regulatory efficacy. The implications for public policy are discussed.",

If this occurs in a fully grown person, the only distinguishing feature will be the increased circumference and the excessive weight. During childhood, however, when growth is a normal process, the problem arises as to how obese children compare with normal ones with regard to those phases of growth which are not expressed by weight. The growing-up process is complex; it includes dimensional growth and differentiation. The first is commonly measured in a simple way, by the increase in weight and stature. The second can be assessed from the structural progress in skeletal development as visualized in roentgenograms. During later childhood and the preadolescent period the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics is an indication of progressing biologic maturation. Though the literature on obesity in childhood is extensive, the problem of studying",

Improvements in children's later intelligence quotient (IQ) linked to certain nutrients such as omega 3 essential fatty acids consumed during pregnancy and childhood has gained attention. Poor nutrition during pregnancy and early life can equally result in impaired physical growth and development throughout an individual's life. Cognitive ability has been reported to influence many key life outcomes. Individuals have tried to improve their own or their children's intellectual abilities through learning aids, study and effort. The possibility of lessening the effort needed with nutrition, drugs or medical techniques has been reported. There is considerable interest in the concept of enhancing cognition or slowing its decline through food supplementation. Based on the ethical principles of beneficence and justice, there is reason to support strategies for improved nutrition, because it would help many people. However, food is also part of cultural identity and an important aspect of social interaction. Therefore, food is not only an instrument for disease prevention. To what extent and how should attempts to improve aspects of cognitive ability and functioning through the use of nutrients or diets that are proven to improve memory, aid in learning, or help people make better decisions be permitted or promoted? What are the opportunities and challenges presented by these \"natural cognitive enhancements''? Should diets be regulated? Should products and supplements frequently lacking in proven beneficial nutrients be restricted or even banned? How does parental intervention impair or enhance children's future freedom to choose? What are the societal implications of changing cultural landscapes and lifestyles that needs to be carefully assessed and balanced? This session will promote discussion around these questions.",

      "abstract": "Background: Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Nutritional status is a condition of the body in those respects influenced by the diet; the levels of nutrients in the body and the ability of those levels to maintain normal metabolic integrity. General adequacy is assessed by measuring weight and height. Kinanthropometry is defined as the study of human size, shape, proportion, composition, maturation, Anthropometry, the systematic collection and correlation of measurements of the human body. Socioeconomic status (SES) is an economic and sociological combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic and social position in relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation. Materials and methods: Subjects are Adolescents girls aged 10-19 years belongs to Salboni Block which is one of block of Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal. Participant’s socioeconomic data are collected through structured questionnaire, anthropometric data are collected through different instruments, and cross section study is done on 1009 girls. Results: In Tables 1 and 2, it was found that age wise there is an increase in the weight, Height of adolescent girls but BMI increases from 13 years to 17 years. In studied girls are belongs to mostly agriculture based family, in this study girls experience menarche 12.1 to 12.9 years of age, and their parents depend on agriculture based economy (Table 3). Among 112 girls, 80 girls parents are service holder, 72 girls come from daily wage labour they experience delayed menarche at 14.1-14.9 years. Table 4 represent that 785 girls post-menarcheal girls belong to skilled labour girls but Pearson chi square represent that socio-economic status and meaneracheal status do not have any significant relation. Similar trend was observed in weight and body mass index, which ranged from 35.61 ± 3.41 to 42.79 ± 5.02 cm and 16.76 ± 2.31 to 18.18 ± 2.00 cm respectively. In this study it shows that studied adolescent girls mean height is 151.02 (4.8) and weight is 44.56 (5.07), whose parents are skilled labour there mean weight 44.54 (5.08) mean height 151.02 (4.82), Mean height of unskilled labur girls are 150.82 (5.04) 44.42 (5.50)mean weight of girls who belongs to unskilled labour parents.",

Etiological understanding, and intervention for low self-control is, therefore, a public health goal. A prominent developmental theory proposes that individuals with high genetic propensity for low self-control that are also exposed to stressful environments may be most at-risk of low levels of self-control. Here we examine if polygenic measures associated with behaviors marked by low self-control interact with stressful life events in predicting self-control.",

Dietary recommendations have been made by various governments and agencies worldwide, and the amounts of carbohydrates and fats recommended for a healthy diet vary greatly. Good nutrition requires a diet with an appropriate number of calories and adequate protein and essential vitamins, minerals, and fluids, while factoring in variances related to age, gender, physical activity, environment, and individual variability. Recommendations must also address the idea that we eat foods, not nutrients, and that cultural norms and traditions must be considered when determining dietary guidance.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. …",

During adolescence, coping with sexual feelings and controlling sexual drive become urgent tasks that are made more difficult by today's society. Recent studies document a dramatic increase in the frequency of sexual activity among teenagers as well as a decrease in the age at which sexual activity begins. The pregnancy rate has increased dramatically in this age-group because of the general lack of willpower and moral strength of young people; lack of adult role models; sexual exploitation of the young, particularly by mass media and industries; and aversion of teenagers to contraception. Births to teenagers have actually decreased slightly, however, because of the accessibility of abortion.",

      "abstract": "There is a continuing nationwide concern regarding the high prevalence of adolescent/teenage/ school-aged pregnancy. The terms adolescent pregnancy, teenage pregnancy, and school-aged pregnancy all have been applied to pregnancy at an age and/or developmental stage that is considered premature or inappropriate, especially with respect to outcome. Whereas fertility is determined by biologic factors, the impact of pregnancy and its consequences have biologic, psychosocial, and environmental determinants. The term \"adolescence\" is applied to the period of psychosocial development from childhood to adulthood that corresponds to chronologic ages 10 or 12 to 21 years. Adolescent pregnancy has different implications for the 18- or 19-year-old high school graduate who is married or planning marriage than for the 13-or 14-year-old middle school student who may be beginning the process of adolescence. Although recognizing this broad spectrum, the Committee on Adolescence has chosen the term \"adolescent pregnancy\" for this and related statements. Our primary concern is the individual in early to middle adolescence (younger than the age of 18 years) who is biologically and/or psychosocially immature, and for whom pregnancy is, often unplanned, if not unwanted. Explanations for the high prevalence have ranged from inadequate sex education to sexual promiscuity. In this statement current research data will be reviewed and relevant information will be provided so that pediatricians and others responsible for the health care of adolescents can appreciate the implications and consequences of adolescent sexual activity and early childbearing. SEXUAL ACTIVITY The current problems resulting from teenage pregnancy cannot be appreciated fully without understanding adolescent sexual behavior and the secular changes that have taken place.",

      "abstract": "The number of genetic and environmental determinants of human growth is very large and their interplay is responsible for the enormously complex phenomenon of prenatal and postnatal growth and simultaneous differentiation in function. Genetic factors participate substantially in determining size at birth, but become more and increasingly important in the realization of inherent potential after the age of two years. Thus, prenatal growth is determined by a greater number of environmental factors than postnatal growth, including parity, pregnancy spacing, maternal age, size, blood pressure, race, health, smoking, alcohol intake, twinning, intrauterine constraint, etc. Galilei's scale effect sets the upper limit of human size, and our surface area determines our metabolic rate and to some extent our life span. Age and rate of pubertal maturation varies with sex, race, and health of the individual, and may be dramatically influenced by numerous environmental and genetic disturbances. One of the most consistent and dramatic effects of autosomal aneuploidy on development is permanent reduction of growth rate, beginning very early in embryonic development. This effect on growth can be interpreted as an abnormality of developmental homeostasis or canalization. Reduced buffering or canalization of growth has been demonstrated in the DS and constitutes most elegant confirmation of the Waddington-Shapiro hypothesis; it ought to be demonstrable also in most if not all of the gonosomal aneuploidies. Thus, an ultrasonographic analysis of embryonic and fetal growth ought to be normal practice in all, not just high--risk pregnancies, and serve as valuable indicator of fetal developmental abnormality if IUGR is found. Because of difference in prognosis and possible difference in obstetric management, ultrasonographers ought to make a distinction in practice between (proportionate) IUGR and (disproportionate) CSOS. Depending on age of onset and severity, reduced prenatal movement can lead to the fetal akinesia sequence including growth retardation of all or part of the fetus. Neurohypotrophy shows that normal innervation is required for normal growth and function of limbs.",

The strong discourse that regulates prescriptive behavior linked to food and the human body has amplified the anxiety and suffering of those who cannot fit the model. Therefore, objective of this study was to understand the meanings, the values attributed to the human body, and the feeding practices that bind to weight loss attempts in a group of overweight women. Results showed a duality of meanings attributed to overweight and a feeling of inadequacy in relation to body fat. Despite the difficulty of adherence, diets is common among informants. Moreover, there are no differences between the recommendations made either by experts or indicated by the common sense. The nutritional education emerges in some narratives as the only viable alternative for the effective weight loss, but also this is not consolidated by informants. The proposed nutritional education showed the repetition of a model that disregards aspects that is related to the socio-cultural identity of groups. Nonetheless, the comprehensive approach to food practices, it is pertinent to take into account that in interventions at the individual level are present aspects related to food cultural identity.

Given the seriousness of violating anyone's right to BI, and especially that of the most vulnerable persons, the appropriate likelihood-of-consent for proceeding with a BI infringement on a child is argued to be at or near the 'medically necessary' threshold.

      "title": "Children and sport – how hard should children be trained?",
      "abstract": "The participation of children and early and late adolescents in resistance training activities, including training for sport, appears to continually be on the rise. The involvement of youth in the sport of weightlifting and the use of weightlifting methods as part of training for sport performance also appears to be growing. The increased acceptance of these activities is evidenced by the number of both lay and scientific articles, specialized magazines and publications devoted to the different types of resistance training. It is also indicated by simple observation of fitness centres and sports training facilities. The use of resistance training appears to be growing in popularity despite poorly supported position statements, anecdotal reports and speculation concerning the potential for injury. Children and adolescents participating in resistance training programs can make noticeable increases in strength and power as well as physiological parameters associated with both health and sport performance. Although the number of children and adolescents (aged 8 – 18 years) involved in some form of resistance training is increasing and evidenced-based reviews that support these activities have been published, controversy still exists. There are still those who insist that training with free weights, particularly the sport of weightlifting, should not take place until a person is fully developed, even though there is not much objective evidence to support such a position. More recently published scientific data support the notion that properly supervised resistance training programs can improve sport performance, reduce injury potential and enhance healthy facets of children and early and late adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Resumen Este articulo es producto de una revision teorica en el marco de la investigacion sobre la identificacion de sentimientos de desesperanza en adultos mayores de 62 a 101 anos de edad en la comuna 2 de la ciudad de Cali. Se definen en ella cuatro ejes tematicos: el adulto mayor segun el ciclo vital del desarrollo humano; la etiologia de la depresion; el significado de los sentimientos de desesperanza; y el apego. La adultez mayor o “vejez” es considerada como “un estado de existencia marginal, que llega con perdida de energia, de control, de flexibilidad, de sexualidad, de movilidad fisica, memoria e incluso inteligencia” (Molano, 2001, p. 20). En este contexto, algunos adultos mayores experimentan la desesperanza y la depresion, mientras que otros consideran como unica salida el suicidio, padecen apatia y cierta voluntad de desercion o de renuncia. Autores como Beck et al. consideran que la desesperanza es una especie de “vulnerabilidad cognitiva, un deseo de escapar de algo” lo cual puede afectar significativamente la vida y el bienestar de los adultos mayores, afectados en gran medida tambien por el apego, como se muestra en el desarrollo del texto.

While physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors accelerate the aging process, deliberate exercise and other forms of activity delay and/or prevent the onset of age-related pathologies such as frailty, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and cardiovascular disease. This review surveys the evidence that supports the position that physical activity is a necessary component for the development and maintenance of the physiological resources that are foundational to physical and cognitive functioning and ‘living well’ in one's later years.",

There are several indexes used to assess Â obesity. The most common measure of obesity is the body massÂ index (BMI). Obesity occurs when a person's calorieintake exceeds the amount of energy he or she burns. Obesity tendsÂ to run in families, suggesting that it may have a genetic cause. However, family members share not only genes but alsoÂ diet and lifestyle habits that may contribute to obesity. Separating these lifestyle factors from genetic ones is often difficult.Â Still, growing evidence points to heredity as a strong determining factor of obesity. In one study of Â adults who wereÂ adopted as children, researchers found that their subjects' adult weights were closer to their biological parents' weightsÂ than to their adoptive parents'. The environment provided by the adoptive family apparently had less influence on theÂ development of obesity than the person's genetic makeup. Although genes are an important factor in many cases ofÂ obesity, a person's environment also plays a significant part. Psychological factors may also influence eating habits.Â Many people eat in response to negative emotions such as boredom, sadness, or anger.Â Key words:Genetic, Obesity, visceral",

Biologically, sex hormones and nucleus accumbent neurotransmitters (mainly testosterone and dopamine) govern human desire. Working, family, mentality, and stress might affect libido. Medical disorders, drugs, lifestyle, relationships, and age might affect libido (e.g., puberty). Hypersexuality is having frequent or suddenly increased sexual impulses; hyposexuality is the opposite. In psychoanalytic thought, libido is a mental drive or energy, connected with sexual instinct but is also present in other innate urges. A man may want sex but not be able to act on it, or may not for medical, moral, or religious reasons. Repressing or sublimating an urge is psychological. One can participate in sexual activity without a sire. Stress, illness, and pregnancy affect sperm drive. Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and norepinephrine act as serotonin This book chapter talks about how functional foods such as spinach, dark chocolate, peppers, green tea, oysters, crab, and pumpkin seeds, which contain neurotransmitters, affect libido.",

Whether an adult has a healthy body, is competent in physical qualities, or maintains a stable mental state, these factors are closely related to their development during childhood and adolescence. Nutrition serves as the material basis for normal growth, development, and maturity. The concept of nutrition is broad, and it is inevitable that dietary balance must be discussed when studying nutrition. A normal diet can meet the body's calorie requirement, build up the body tissues, and maintain the proper functioning of the organs. Whereas a balanced diet goes further by combining the nutrients in appropriate proportions to better satisfy the body's needs and achieve a balance between supply and demand. Individuals can purposefully and selectively supplement specific nutrients through a rational diet.",

      "abstract": "Einleitung Ess- und Körperbildstörungen werden gesellschaftlich und wurden lange in der Forschung als Störungen dünner, weißer, wohlhabender Mädchen betrachtet. Dagegen entwickelte sich in den letzten Jahren ein zunehmendes Bewusstsein für Diversität als Forschungsdimension. So ergeben sich – überwiegend aus dem US-amerikanischen Raum – belastbare Hinweise auf erhöhte Prävalenzraten in sexuellen und geschlechtlichen Minderheitengruppen. Mit soziokulturellen Theorien, Minderheitenstressmodell und Objektifizierungstheorie bestehen Rahmenkonzepte, die spezifische Einflussfaktoren auf Körperbild und Essverhalten in diesen Personengruppen annehmen. Diese Theorien sind bislang wenig integriert und zu den Einflüssen einzelner Faktoren wie bspw. community involvement oder Prozessen der (Selbst-) Objektifizierung ergeben sich widersprüchliche Befunde. Zudem wird das Körperbild häufig auf einzelne Komponenten reduziert oder unidimensional (Schlankheit oder Muskularität) konzeptualisiert. Schließlich existiert insgesamt eine geringere Zahl diversitätssensitiver Untersuchungen aus dem deutschsprachigen Raum. Das vorgestellte Projekt erfasst mit Gender und sexueller Orientierung daher zwei Aspekte von Diversität und begreift Körperbild als multidimensionales Konstrukt. Neben der Erfassung von Gruppenunterschieden soll unter Zusammenschau obiger Theorien der Beitrag einzelner Faktoren zur körperbildbezogenen Unzufriedenheit und Modifikationsverhaltensweisen bei LGBTQ- und hetero-cis-Personen untersucht werden.",

It symbolizes self-control, hard work, ambition, and success in life. Inherent in this symbolism is the concept that the individual controls behavior, which in turn controls health. Although control over one's life plays an important role in both physical and mental health, the concept of personal control also infers responsibility. Positive attributes are accorded to people who are healthy, but those who fall ill, or those with less than the perfect body, are blamed and are thought to be self-indulgent, lazy, or even irresponsible and immoral. There is a tendency to overstate the impact of personal behavior on health. However, biological realities shape the degree to which health is under the control of the individual. The positive effects of behavior change must be balanced with the limits imposed by biology.",

      "abstract": "Gender-based victimisation (GBV) is commonly experienced by transgender individuals, and can include physical or sexual violence; social, workplace, or housing discrimination; or family or social rejection. In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual's gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income and being a person of colour were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of US adolescent and adult transgender persons (n = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.",

      "abstract": "Fatness and obesity are body characteristics which are both ascribed and achieved for adults. Socioeconomic status (SES) is the ranking of individuals within complex societies. In traditional societies a direct relationship between SES and fatness exists, while in modern societies there is an inverse association between SES and obesity for adult women but mixed patterns for other age/sex groups. A framework recognizing the difference between variables on the physical and social level of analysis needs to be used to examine the relationship between fatness (a physical variable) and SES (a social variable). Different mechanisms are involved in the causal pathways where SES influences obesity and obesity influences SES. SES influences obesity by education, income, and occupation causing variations in behaviors which change energy consumption, energy expenditure and metabolism. Obesity influences SES when the perception of obesity is interpreted through prejudiced beliefs, with subsequent stigmatization and discrimination limiting access to higher SES roles.",

A disparate population is one in which disease and/or death rates are significantly worse compared to the health or mortality status of the general or comparison population. Rural-urban health disparities may be present among older adults in a number of ways. One common subtype differences by rural-urban status can occur when rural older adults are at a relative health disadvantage compared to urban and suburban older adults. Another common subtype, moderation of other disparities by rural-urban status is when other types of disparities are more pronounced among older adults living in rural areas than those living in urban and suburban areas. That is, where an older adult lives moderates or amplifies existing demographic, social, or economic disparities.",

History and science have clearly documented the key role played by breeding and inheritance. Spontaneous medical conditions have provided further insight into other important factors through ‘nature’s experiments’ such as isolated growth hormone or testosterone deficiencies or excess. The androgen insensitivity syndrome illustrates the key role of testosterone in utero, in determining the male phenotype. In this condition where a mutation that inactivates the testosterone receptor leads to the birth of a phenotypically ‘normal’ female baby (who matures into a normal but infertile woman) despite having XY chromosomes, testes and a high testosterone level. Misunderstanding of these complex issues has led to the introduction of nonsensible rules in elite sport.",

      "abstract": "The accurate measurement of physical activity is fraught with problems in adults, but more especially in children because they have more complex and multi-dimensional activity patterns. In addition, the results of different studies are often difficult to interpret and compare, because of the diversity of methodological approaches, differences in data analysis and reporting, and the adoption of varying definitions of what constitutes an appropriate level of activity. Furthermore, inactivity is seldom quantified directly. Although there exists an extensive literature documenting the health benefits of regular physical activity in adults, activity-health relationships in children are not clear-cut. Current recommendations reinforce the concept of health-related activity, accumulating 30 min moderate-intensity exercise on at least 5 d/week (adults) and 1 h moderate-intensity exercise/d (children). Evidence suggests a high prevalence of inactivity in adults, but whether or not inactivity is increasing cannot be assessed currently. Similarly, no definite conclusions are justified about either the levels of physical activity of children, or whether these are sufficient to maintain and promote health. Data to support the belief that activity levels in childhood track into adulthood are weak. Inactivity is associated with an increased risk of weight gain and obesity, but causality remains to be established. In children there is strong evidence to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between the prevalence and incidence of obesity and time spent viewing television. Future research should focus on refining methodology for physical activity assessment to make it more sensitive to the different dimensions and contexts of activity in different age-groups.",

The consensus of opinion, apparently supported by the fact that the foreign-born American woman or those accustomed to hard life have an easier labor than the American woman of nervous temperament, seems to be that athletics are beneficial at all times, except possibly at the menstrual periods. Besides the many factors, such as heredity, increased sensory conduction and reception, deficient muscular forces, etc., that influence childbirth, I believe there is a marked difference on the pelvis in the physiologic effect of the exercise performed. The type of exercise (work) of the working woman has its predominating effect on the musculatures of the trunk and upper extremities.

The fetal brain develops in the male direction due to a direct effect of testosterone on the developing neurons, or in the female direction due to the absence of such a testosterone surge. Because sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place earlier in intrauterine life than sexual differentiation of the brain, these two processes can be influenced independently of each other. Gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender), sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality), pedophilia, sex differences in cognition, and the risks for neuropsychiatric disorders are programmed into our brains during early development. There is no proof that postnatal social environment has any crucial effect on gender identity or sexual orientation. Structural and functional sex differences in brain areas, together with changes in sex hormone levels and their receptors in development and adulthood, are closely related to sex differences in behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders. Knowing that such a relationship exists may help bring about sex-specific therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Does Elite Competition Inhibit Growth and Delay Maturation in Some Gymnasts? Quite Possibly",
      "abstract": "Today, elite young gymnasts undertake training programs of progressive volume and intensity from an early age. For example, talented young female gymnasts often commence training at age 5 or 6 and train more than 20 to 30 hours per week year-round throughout childhood and adolescence. Despite the normal short stature of top-level gymnasts and the obvious health benefits of physical activity during growth, there is concern that elite level or those gymnasts involved heavy training regimens may be at risk for adverse effects on growth and maturation. This concern has been the source of much debate the literature and is complicated by the difficulties distinguishing between the genetic predisposition to short stature and late or delayed maturation, and the effect of environmental factors such as nutrition and exercise that may influence growth and maturation. The effect of gymnastics training on growth and maturation is often reported as averaged data: an approach that does not identify individual growth patterns. Finding no difference between groups is not proof that there is in fact no difference. Accepting the null hypothesis without the appropriate critical review of both the methodological and statistical power to detect differences is a flawed endeavor. We believe there is compelling circumstantial evidence to build a case that preparation for advanced gymnastics competition may place some children and youth at risk of reduced growth and delayed maturation.",

It was predicted and found that subjects did not hold negative attitudes to aging per se but such attitudes were influenced by negative environmental conditions (un controllability and institutionalization) associated with aging and which have been found to actually promote physical and psychological decline. Negative attitudes toward aging may not merely reflect the aging process, but may be determinants of both the experience of aging and general attitudes toward the aged.",

      "abstract": "If we are to understand why it is so rare and what the future holds, the topic of body positivity in males has evolved into a complex one that requires discussion. Men frequently encounter irrational expectations that result in body dissatisfaction and a low sense of self- worth in todays society, when media representations of the ideal male form and gender stereotypes predominate. The medias depiction of the ideal male body, which is characterized by muscular proportions and low body fat, is a major reason man are not positive about their bodies. These restrictive rules put pressure on men to conform, which can cause body dissatisfaction and a decrease in self- esteem. Furthermore, the traditional gender roles of men and women indicate the idea that men should be portrayed as strong, stoic, and emotionally controlled, which discourages open conversations about body image issues and the need for assistance. The psychological and mental toll it takes on a person can cause various issues in men, both physically and mentally. It may be caused by constant pressure to meet these standards. Feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction can also be a contributing factor. It can lead to chronic problems in life. The most important part of maintaining a healthy state of mind is managing these body image concerns. In men, theres a lot of ways to support positive body image. Through education and awareness programs, these programs challenge harmful beauty norms and promote positive body image. Resources and workshops to help men reject outdated ideas and accepting body positivity need to be provided by schools, organizations, and communities. Its critical that we dismantle obstacles when it comes to mens body image. The secret to building an environment where guys can talk about their issues and receive assistance without fear of judgment is to have open dialogues about topics like how they feel about their bodies and mental health. Social media can also be a useful tool for promoting campaigns that celebrate the diversity of peoples bodies and for sharing fascinating tales that people can relate to.",

Multiple levels in our environment convey these messages, including mass media, peers, and family, and influence the likelihood of purging. Although these beliefs are widely held, they deviate from facts. Behaviors rather than body weight are the strongest determinant of health. The association between weight and beauty is highly subjective and malleable. There is no association between body weight and moral character. The majority of the U.S. population is not living in social isolation despite possessing body weights that deviate from the thin/muscular ideal.

      "title": "Bad Foods: Changing Attitudes About What We Eat",
      "abstract": "Popular attitudes toward nutrition have been influenced by a variety of psychological, social, historical, and political factors. Foods frequently have reputations for health that have little to do with their nutrient content. Similarly, food nutrients (for example, dietary fat) often have reputations that are not in agreement with the established science concerning that particular nutrient. Bad Foods explores factors that influence our attitudes about healthy eating in the United States today. As Oakes demonstrates, a variety of historical or political events and personalities have shaped our current views of good nutrition. On several occasions in American history concerns have arisen over the safety of our food supply (e.g., harmful ingredients in processed foods) and the potential that processing might deplete foods of their nutrients. These concerns help explain how food characteristics such as freshness, natural, organic, and unprocessed have become important to Americans. Bad Foods traces how the food nutrients fat, salt, and sugar have acquired negative reputations for health as well as any controversies and outright misconceptions of the dangers of these nutrients. Bad Foods also explores confusion that can in part be attributed to biased media coverage about foods. Modern Americans are routinely bombarded with information about the health value of certain foods and the dangers of others. Frequently, health information about certain nutrients receives exaggerated coverage (e.g., dietary fat) while the importance of other nutrients gets ignored (e.g., vitamins and minerals). Moreover, health information about foods is often perceived as contradictory. While some readers may be startled by what they perceive to be a challenge to sacred beliefs about foods, others will see the honesty in both the research and the writing and recognize the social benefits of examining our beliefs about foods. Bad Foods will be of interest to sociologists, food science specialists, and social historians.",

However, it is now well accepted that its development stems from interaction of multiple environmental factors (abundant food availability and/or reduction in physical activity) with genetic factors. During the last decades, the increased availability of palatable food and the conditions of decreased physical activity (motorization/sedentary games) dramatically increased the prevalence of childhood obesity in industrialized countries. More recently, occurrence of this obesogenic environment in developing nations led to a rapid increase in its prevalence in urban regions, whereas a lot of children still suffer from undernutrition in rural regions of the same countries [1]. In addition, numerous epidemiological and intervention studies carried out in different cohorts (twins brought up together or separately, adopted children, nuclear families, etc.) have recognized the role of individual genetic and biological susceptibilities in response to the current weight-gain promoting environment [2].",

Erectile dysfunction is a disability to get an erection or to maintain the erection well enough for a sexual intercourse, which persists or recurs at least three months conse-cutively due to either psychogenic or organic disturbances, or both. Some psychogenic dis-turbances especially depression, anxiety, and relational distress, play some important roles in ED. Besides that, aging, low testoteron level, physical diseases, and some certain medicines have to be included. Key words: erection, erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulus, depression. Abstract: Fungsi seksual yang normal merupakan suatu proses biopsikososial yang berkaitan langsung dengan kualitas hidup. Adanya gangguan pada salah satu komponen dapat menjadi malapetaka bagi kehidupan seksual. Disfungsi ereksi dapat dedefinisikan sebagai suatu keti-dakmampuan untuk ereksi atau mempertahankan ereksi yang cukup untuk melakukan hu-bungan seksual yang memuaskan, yang menetap atau berulang paling tidak selama tiga bulan berturut-turut. Gangguan psikogenik khususnya sindroma depresi, ankietas, dan distres relasional berperan penting dalam hal terjadinya disfungsi ereksi. Disamping itu usia lanjut, rendahnya kadar testoteron, penyakit fisik, dan beberapa jenis obat perlu diperhitungkan. Kata kunci: fisiologi ereksi, disfungsi ereksi, stimulus seksual, depresi.",

      "title": "Why do People Suffer from Eating Disorders? A Critical Evaluation of the Contemporary Etiological Models of Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders is one of the most prominent health issues among adolescents not only in the West but also in non-Eastern countries like India. Its higher prevalence during adolescence is often seen as a form of defense against the demands for greater autonomy and responsibility during this period of transition and often linked with stress as the key variable. However, empirical studies attribute this to the changing patters of family dynamics during adolescence. Whereas, in contrast to this, the psychiatric morbidity model suggests that, eating disorders are seen as manifestation of psychological disturbances such as major depression and obsessivecompulsive disorders, at some point of time, as these disorders are almost three times more common among patients, particularly, with anorexia nervosa. Whereas, addictive models of eating disorders suggest that, eating disorders are driven by compulsion to eat or avoid eating in spite of either satiation or deprivation, respectively in obesity and anorexia nervosa, whereas sociocultural models emphasize social and familial expectations as well as social desirability as the driving force. Psychoanalytic models on the other hand focus on the underlying unconscious motives at the core of eating disorders, and cognitive models, on the underlying thoughts and belief systems, whereas, the biological models have attributed eating disorders to genetics and biochemistry. The article attempts to critically evaluate these prevalent contemporary models of eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Die Zahlen von Menschen, die ihre sexuelle Identität nicht als heterosexuell sondern als schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell oder in einer anderen Kategorie definieren, steigen seit Jahren leicht an; man schätzt, dass in westlichen Ländern ca. 5% der Bevölkerung zu den sexuellen Minderheiten zu rechnen sind. Diese Studie ist darauf angelegt, die psychischen Problemlagen der sexuellen Minoritäten anhand US-amerikanischer Bevölkerungsstudien sowie weiterer wichtiger Studien aus anderen Ländern genauer darzustellen. Ergebnisse Zusammenfassend ergibt sich Folgendes: Unabhängig vom Geschlecht liegt der Konsum von Alkohol und anderen Drogen sowie die Abhängigkeit von diesen Stoffen mindestens auf dem Niveau der heterosexuellen Männer. Lesbisch/schwule und bisexuelle Frauen sind noch etwas stärker durch den Konsum von psychoaktiven Substanzen belastet als schwule und bisexuelle Männer. Untersucht man Belastungen durch Depressionen und Suizidversuche, findet man wiederum bei den sexuellen Minoritäten höhere Belastungen. LSB-Frauen haben die höchsten Raten hinsichtlich Depressionen und Ängsten. Darüber hinaus weisen die Daten darauf hin, dass bisexuelle Männer und Frauen hohe psychische Belastungen haben. Alles in allem genommen ist davon auszugehen, dass die sexuellen Minoritäten einen relativ hohen Bedarf an Behandlungen ihrer psychischen Störungen haben. Dennoch gibt es bislang nur sehr wenige Behandlungsprogramme mit der Zielgruppe: sexuelle Minoritäten. Schlussfolgerungen Wir benötigen dringend deutsche Studien zu sexuellen Minoritäten allgemein und besonders zu trans* Personen mit ihren sehr spezifischen Problemlagen. Die Studien sollten neben den Substanzkonsumstörungen der sexuellen Minoritäten auch andere psychische Störungen erfassen. Kenntnisse über die psychische Befindlichkeit sexueller Minoritäten sind die Grundlage für optimale Behandlungsgestaltungen.",

It was assumed that women's development proceeded according to a certain stereotype [ 1] or that the male model applied to women's development as well [ 2] . These assumptions had negative consequences: women were either relegated to a role that restricted their growth or judged abnormal because they did not meet the male standard. In the last few years, researchers and theorists have begun to explore the impact of the realities women face in family life and at work on the formation of female identity. The research is critical to an understanding of the mental health problems that afflict women and the adaptive strategies they utilize. Moreover, it suggests a model of mental health toward which women can grow.",

      "abstract": "Balance is an important issue in aging research since it is undoubtedly linked with motor performance affecting, thus, activities of daily living and consecutively the quality of life in the elderly. Maintenance of good balance ability reduces the chance of a fall which, especially in the elderly, is not only an important predictor of mortality but also a major problem with important negative health and socio-economic consequences. The fear of falling, on the other hand, results in restrictions of physical activity, functional ability, and consequently may lead to reduced quality of life and adverse health consequences [5]. Another psychological variable linked to the fear of falling is balance confidence or falls self-efficacy, which refers to personal beliefs in one’s ability to engage in certain activities of daily living without falling or losing balance [8]. Increased balance confidence, which is determined to a great extent by balance performance [2], is associated with lower fear of falling and better functional ability [6]. Physical activity seems to have a positive relation with balance confidence but the outcomes of this relation are not well understood. Some findings suggest that the improvement in balance confidence through an exercise intervention program is only weakly correlated with improved general physical function and not associated with improvements in postural stability [7]. Other findings, however, suggest that balance confidence plays a mediatory role in the effects of fear of falling on functional outcomes [6], and if the exercise program is aimed at the enhancement of balance confidence then the fear of falling is likely to be reduced [4]. Balance confidence and balance performance have been found to be significant predictors of fall status [3]. It is not, known however, if the relationship between balance confidence, balance performance and habitual physical activity, is different in fallers than in nonfallers. This study aimed to examine the relationship between balance performance, balance confidence and physical activity, which is reflected in the number of steps performed in everyday life, taking into account the fall history of elderly persons.",

In adults, values for the ‘normal’ and ‘healthy’ amounts of body fat have not been defined although it is recognized that on average men and women differ in the percentage of body weight as fat (%BF) with women being fatter than men. Percentage BF is also under genetic influence and there are ethnic and familial differences in normal fatness. In childhood the proportion of fat to lean tissue in the body not only varies between boys and girls, but also changes with age and physical maturity making it even more difficult to determine what is physiologically normal either for an individual or for a population (Table 2.1).",

A new eating disorder is emerging, the socalled Nervosa(ON). Orthorexia is related to the extreme worry in the search for health concentrated in eating as healthily and purely as possible. It consists of an excessive obsession and worry for healthy, natural or biological intake, which leads the individual to exclusively consume food coming from ecological agriculture, free from transgenic or artificial components, pesticides or herbicides. In the developed societies, where the problem is not the lack of food but the excess, eating disorders are becoming more common. ON seems not to affect the marginal sectors but rather on the contrary since this type of food is much more expensive than the usual one and also more difficult to obtain.",

      "title": "[Who requests voluntary interruption of pregnancy?].",
      "abstract": "The sense that abortion is the last resort for women placed in a distress situation by the continuation of the pregnancy should be preserved. No woman requesting abortion regards it as trivial, and postabortal depressions are more common than the banalization of the procedure might imply. Reasons for terminating the pregnancy are usually among the following: breakup of the couple, a recent loss, advanced age of existing children, emigration, or material difficulty. The psychological situation of pregnant adolescents is confused and sad, mixing the normal difficulties of adolescents with the affective problems of pregnancy and perhaps family problems as well. Pregnancy to an adolescent can symbolically represent a lack, a competition, or a selfpunishment; it can function as a proof of femininity, or a means of informing the parents of the girl's sex life. Pregnancy and abortion are experienced differently by adult women, who at a certain age feel a strong drive to realize the wish for maternity. Nevertheless, some women suffer a permanent conflict between the desire to have and the desire not to have children. Adult women may desire pregnancy, even accidental pregnancy, to prove their fertility, relive their own childhood, reassure themselves about menopause, fill a lack, or for numerous other reasons apart from wanting a child. Voluntary abortion can be defined as a strong unconscious desire for pregnancy tied to a conscious rejection of maternity. Interviews with women requesting abortions disclose the numerous conflicts that may exist with a maternal image, with the woman's own body, in the case of a recent loss, or at the breakup of a marriage. Studies have shown that the ambience in which the abortion is performed is of overwhelming importance for the later attitude of the woman; personnel involved should avoid adding to the trauma already experienced by the woman by making her feel guilty.",

If one adheres to this positive motivation of mental hygiene, i.e. working toward an ideal, he finds an incentive to progress over a wide range of possible achievement; whereas to strive merely for the absence of mental disease leaves one unmoved by the larger wastage of unrealized potentialities and satisfactions.",

Humans are not strictly seasonal breeders, but frequently exhibit seasonal fluctuations in births.

It must explain three basic facts about obesity: gender dimorphism (women greater than men), an increase with modernization, and a positive association with socioeconomic status. Preindustrial diets varied in quality but shared a tendency to periodic shortages. Such shortages, particularly disadvantageous to women in their reproductive years, favored individuals who, for biological and cultural reasons, stored fat. Not surprisingly, the majority of the world's cultures had or have ideals of feminine beauty that include plumpness. This is consistent with the hypothesis that fat stores functioned as a cushion against food shortages during pregnancy and lactation. As obesity has increased, the traditional gap between males and females in its prevalence has narrowed. Under Western conditions of abundance, our biological tendency to regulate body weight at levels above our ideal cannot be easily controlled even with a complete reversal of the widespread cultural ideal of plumpness.",

      "title": "Stress Mediates the Health Effects of Many Social Determinants",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines current scientific knowledge of how stress influences health and health disparities. Stress (the experience of feeling “stressed” or “stressed out”) is distinguished from a stressor (an event or condition that causes stress) and from the stress response (the body’s physiologic response to stress). Advances in neuroscience indicate that stress is likely to be an important link between many social factors and many health outcomes. Chronic exposure to multiple everyday hardships (especially conditions over which one has little control) is likely to be more damaging to health than dramatic acute stressors. “Bad” (“toxic”) stress is stress that overwhelms one’s ability to cope, causing adverse cognitive, behavioral, and/or physiological effects. The links between social disadvantage (e.g., poverty and discrimination) and stress are explored in this chapter. For example, having chronically inadequate economic resources to cope with basic everyday needs—such as food, shelter, child care, elder care, or medical care—is likely to be stressful, as is experiencing ongoing discrimination (unfair treatment based on attributes such as race/ethnic group, skin color, religion, gender, disability, or LGBTQ status). Social support appears to protect to some extent against the health-damaging effects of stress. Strategies to reduce stress, particularly that due to social disadvantage, are discussed.",

More attractive adolescents are more likely to engage in underage drink- ing; while they are less likely to smoke, use drugs, or practice unprotected sex. Investigation into the underlying channels reveals that popularity, self-esteem, and personality attractiveness have roles as mechanisms. Our findings suggest physical attractiveness in adolescence carries long-lasting consequences over the life course.",

      "abstract": "With ever-increasing media attention on weight, many adolescents judge their bodies to be inferior to the advertised images. Exposure to a daily diet of airbrushed, surgically altered, and augmented bodies provides an active template for adolescent body dissatisfaction. Adolescents are at an increased risk for downgrading the physical attractiveness and appropriateness of their bodies because they are actively comparing themselves to idealized adolescent portrayals. Body esteem issues are compounded by the identity crisis that confronts and challenges the adolescent. A hallmark of adolescence is resolving this identity crisis, a state that is exacerbated by a craving for a fictionalized body. The adolescent who is obese may have to contend with additional body esteem pressures and compounded identity issues because of their appearance. After years or a lifetime of struggling with obesity, concurrent with societal stigmatization and peer harassment, the risk of a disturbed body image multiplies. Bariatric surgery for weight loss seems to the obese adolescent to be their “dream come true,” but what happens when results do not match “Hollywood standards?” An important factor in determining the suitability of an obese adolescent for weight-loss surgery (WLS) entails having the adolescent envision how they believe their body will look as they lose weight and how they expect their body to appear at their goal weight. Identification of unrealistic expectations prior to WLS is an important determinant in deciding the adolescent's readiness. A structured, comprehensive nursing assessment of the adolescent's current and projected body image helps to identify ongoing issues and potential problems that may include eating disorders, dysmorphia, and other mental health issues.",

      "abstract": "For some adolescents the bodily changes occurring at puberty and during adolescence are a source of intense anxiety. Rather than integrate the new sexual body within the existing body image, these adolescents respond to the physical changes with behavior that attempts to maintain the omnipotent fantasy that they are in control of their bodies. Unconsciously they experience the changes as if they are able to prevent physical change from taking place and therefore can remain passively dependent on their parents. They feel as if the sexual body has the power to make them helpless by forcing them to submit passively to its demands. The case of an adolescent seen in analysis is presented to illustrate the defensive function of such symptomatic behavior and its repetitive, compulsive quality.",

      "abstract": "Social contagion refers to the spreading of a behaviour, idea, attitude, or even an emotion, across a social group due to imitation and conformity by its members. The idea that obesity may spread due to social contagion is based on its observed clustering across networks of individuals, who are joined by other types of social similarities (e.g. friendships and residences). However, previous analyses were based on observational data and are prone to confounding and self-selection into social networks. This study took a unique approach, leveraging the natural experiment of military assignment, which except in rare cases is beyond the control of the individual. The findings show that families who are assigned to US counties with higher rates of obesity are more likely to be overweight or obese. The effects strengthened with longer duration of residence. The findings were not explained by differences in the built environment that might influence outdoor physical activity. In our efforts to control overweight and obesity, we need to understand and tackle the 'social norms' held by populations and population subgroups, which can often foster unhealthy attitudes, beliefs and behaviours towards food, exercise, and weight status, even from very early ages (1).",

      "abstract": "Cravings are hedonic responses to food, characterised by their intensity and their specificity. Food cravings are extremely common, reported by the majority of young adults. They are closely associated with liking but not synonymous with increased intake. Structured interviews and prospective incident accounts of food cravings have succeeded in revealing a richness of information about their character, their antecedents and their consequences. In addition, laboratory investigations are adding to what is being learned from field and clinical studies. Taking dieting as an example of an assumed influence on food craving, the outcomes of cross-sectional studies are mixed and unconvincing. Prospective and experimental research shows a clearer relationship. Dieting or restrained eating generally increase the likelihood of food craving while fasting makes craving, like hunger, diminish. Attempted restriction or deprivation of a particular food is associated with an increase in craving for the unavailable food. This relationship suggests a variety of underlying cognitive, conditioning and emotional processes, of which ironic cognitive processes, conditioned cue reactivity and dysphoric mood are prominent. Food cravings may also be self-attributions, accounting for why a highly-palatable but self-restricted food is (over-)consumed. Overall, the popularised account of cravings as elicited by specific nutritional need is having to give way to a more subtle and complex appreciation of human eating behaviour.",

Successful navigation of the social environment requires individuals to adapt to continually changing stimuli. Stress impacts health by impairing an individual's ability to adapt. Impairments in the ability to adapt may result in significant challenges to mental and physical well‐being in the form of psychological distress and/or the development of chronic disease. Men and women are often exposed to different types of stressors and different levels of stress, and tend to respond differently to stress. This results in varying health outcomes. Inquiries into the relationship between gender, stress, and health have increased understanding of the processes by which adaptability is compromised. Gender is one of the major ways in which individuals organize their lives, and most people fail to realize its strong influence on social life.",

Identification of growth disorders in all children is crucial as growth failure can be the first sign of a number of acute and chronic conditions. However, gender and racial biases have resulted in inequities in the identification, referral and treatment of children with growth disorders. In addition, short children have been impacted by a number of psychosocial issues. Heightism is prejudice or discrimination against individuals based on height, and refers to discrimination against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range. Studies have shown that short children have been affected by juvenilization, teasing, bullying, victimization, loss of independence/ overprotection, and exclusion. The role of the advanced practice nurse is critical in addressing heightism and racial and gender disparities in children with growth failure/short stature.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood that begins around the onset of puberty and ends with relative independence from the parent. This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm's way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control--the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-specific changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.",

      "title": "Assessment and Interpretation of Aerobic Fitness in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Our understanding of the development of children and adolescents' aerobic fitness is limited by ethical considerations and methodological constraints. Protocols, apparatus, and criteria of maximal effort used with adults are often unsuitable for use with children. In normal children and adolescents, peak VO2 increases with growth and maturation, although there are indications that girls' peak VO2 may level off around 14 years of age. Males exhibit higher values of peak VO2 than females, and the sex difference increases as they progress through adolescence. The difference between males and females has been attributed to the boys' greater muscle mass and hemoglobin concentration. It appears that boys experience an adolescent growth spurt in peak VO2, which reaches a maximum gain near the time of PHV, but data are insufficient to offer any generalization for girls. Peak VO2 has usually been expressed in relation to body mass, and with this convention it appears that boys' values are consistent throughout the developmental period, whereas girls' values decrease as they get older. This type of analysis may, however, have clouded our understanding of growth and maturational changes in peak VO2, and scaling for differences in body size may provide further clarification. If differences are shown where none were previously thought to exist, then physiological explanations must be sought. Methodological issues have also hindered the understanding of how children's blood lactate responses to exercise develop. The actual lactate level recorded during an exercise test is influenced by the site of sampling and the blood handling and assay techniques. Valid interstudy comparisons can only be made where similar procedures have been employed. In general, children demonstrate lower blood lactate levels at peak VO2 than adults, although individual variation is wide. Therefore the use of blood lactate measures to confirm the attainment of peak VO2 cannot be supported. Exercise at the same relative submaximal intensity elicits a lower blood lactate in children than in adults, but interpretation and identification of developmental and maturational patterns of response are limited by the use of different testing conditions and reference points (e.g., lactate threshold and fixed level reference points). There is growing evidence that the 2.5 mM reference level should be used in preference to the 4.0 mM level, as the adult criterion occurs close to maximal exercise in many children and adolescents. Explanations for child-adult differences in blood lactate responses to exercise are difficult to elucidate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Para examinar la viabilidad de tales investigaciones, se llevo a cabo un estudio para analizar la prevalencia de fragilidad entre 50 adultos jovenes cronicos indigentes en la Ciudad de Mexico al medir su fuerza de prension y luego compararla con la misma informacion recolectada de un grupo de 50 estudiantes universitarios que nunca habian sido indigentes y que comprendian la muestra control. El sindrome de fragilidad se ha asociado frecuentemente con el envejecimiento y las enfermedades cronicas. Su presencia en adultos jovenes indigentes demuestra que tambien puede ser causada por condiciones de vida adversas. Esto apoya la idea de que su salud general es un indice del sufrimiento social, el estres, la exclusion y la violencia que tienen que enfrentar diariamente y que son causa de un envejecimiento acelerado que explica su alto indice de mortalidad.

The frailty syndrome has more often been associated with aging and chronic illnesses. Its presence in homeless young adults proves that it can also be caused by adverse life conditions. This supports the idea that their general health is an index of the social suffering, stress, exclusion and violence that they have to deal with on a daily basis and that it causes an accelerated aging that explains their high mortality index. This study is part of a wider ethnographical research effort that seeks to better understand their general state of being and improve it through more precisely designed interventions that are relevant to their skills and capacities.",

It appears from the material reviewed that dietary habits improve nutritionally from childhood to young adulthood hence most pregnant women probably enter pregnancy with acceptable dietary habits. Exceptions to this generalization may be individuals for the lower socioeconomic groups, and ethnic groups such as blacks and Hispanics, and adolescents. These population groups have been found to have a high incidence of undernutrition from various surveys. Dietary cravings and aversions during pregnancy abound, almost universally. These are limited to the pregnant state and are therefore transitory changes in dietary habits. Generally, these do not diminish dietary quality, unless accompanied by exaggerated nausea and vomiting or the practice of pica. What transpires with the parents' dietary habits after the birth of the child and as the child grows older is subject to speculation. Evidence suggests that food habits of young children and their parents are similar, characterized by preference for sweets. It is possible that dietary habits of young parents deteriorate until their children are grown.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between age, live weight, body composition and energy status on the onset and maintenance of reproductive activity in females is reviewed. When possible, swine studies have been employed, although, of necessity, much data are drawn from other species. The relationship between age, weight and puberty is controversial. However, from the available data we conclude that neither age nor weight are reliable indices of reproductive development, but that minimum threshold values for these characteristics must be achieved before puberty can occur. Human data provides a strong indication that a minimum adipose to lean tissue ratio is a prerequisite for puberty onset. Limited data from swine support this contention and indeed it may be a superior measure of reproductive development than either age or weight. However, the value of this ratio remains to be defined in pigs, and again it is minimum threshold level, the attainment of which is necessary, but not in itself sufficient, for puberty onset. A positive energy balance seems to be necessary for puberty onset and the maintenance of estrous cycles in some species, but this has not been investigated in swine. The mechanisms whereby adiposity and energy status influences reproduction are discussed. Human studies demonstrate a negative correlation between energy status, body fatness and plasma gonadotrophin levels. Also, adipose tissue has the ability to metabolize sex steroids, aromatizing androgens to estrogens and changing the direction of estrogen metabolism to produce more or less biologically potent estrogens.",

Compared to naïfs, sophisticates have higher IQs, better educated parents, and are more likely to use potential commitment devices. Despite their self-control problems, sophisticated individuals make similar choices as time-consistent individuals when those choices involve immediate costs and later benefits.

Until recently, it has been politically fashionable to dogmatically equate malnutrition in childhood with physical and mental retardation. It is true that severe undernutrition during the latter stages of pregnancy and the first few months of life will jeopardize mental and physical development. In an older child, however, nutritional deprivation may create only a maturational lag; ie, with time, the child may overcome the handicap.

Thus a woman’s sexual function encompasses many areas; the construct of a normal function as a quality of life indicator often but not always conforms to the sexual response cycle, which is an endogenous process contributed by hormonal, vascular, neuronal, and psycho-emotional factors. Clinical and scientific evidence abounds about the physiological role of sex steroids viz. oestrogen, testosterone, and also progesterone in facilitating and maintaining the woman’s sexual parameters. The neurophysiology extends from the central and peripheral nervous systems to the targeted genital structures resulting in coordinated vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle relaxation, to be accompanied by pelvic vasocongestion, vaginal lubrication, and labial and clitoral engorgement. Any detrimental impact on this normal cycle of concerted responses can result in a functional impairment or ‘female sexual dysfunction’ (FSD). Sexual changes, psychogenic or organic, are common in women at any age; such complaints are frequently accompanied by quality-of-life concerns, varying levels of personal distress, anxiety, depression, and also fertility concerns in younger women. With FSD as a medically diagnosable entity, fewer drugs have met the safety and efficacy criteria for global approval and clinical utility. In order to appreciate the diverse range of FSD and the extent of its physical, physiological, and psychological implications, it is important to understand the fundamentals as well as the changing paradigms in a woman’s sexual functioning.",

Indien een persoon met genderdysforie kiest voor een geslachtsaanpassende behandeling, wordt gestart met cross-sex hormonen welke zorgen voor geslachtskenmerken van het gewenste geslacht. Onder invloed van cross-sex hormonen blijkt dat zowel man-naar-vrouw transgenders (Male to Female, MtF) als vrouw-naar-man transgenders (Female to Male, FtM) aankomen in lichaamsgewicht. Echter is onbekend of dit veroorzaakt wordt door een verandering in ruststofwisseling, door een toename in energie-inname of door andere redenen. Er is nog geen onderzoek gedaan naar het effect van cross-sex hormonen op de ruststofwisseling.

Over energie-inname, smaak- en voedselvoorkeuren bij transgenders is nog weinig bekend. Doel: Met dit onderzoek wordt inzicht verkregen in het effect van 3 maanden cross-sex hormoonbehandeling op de ruststofwisseling, lichaamssamenstelling, eetlust, energie-inname, smaak- en voedselvoorkeuren bij transgenders vanaf 18 jaar. Methoden: Data zijn verzameld in het Vrije Universiteit medisch centrum (VUmc) te Amsterdam. 14 transgenders (7 MtF en 7 FtM transgenders) vanaf 18 jaar werden geincludeerd voor dit onderzoek. Bij alle deelnemers werd voorafgaand en na 3 maanden cross-sex hormoonbehandeling de ruststofwisseling (indirecte calorimetrie), de lichaamssamenstelling (Bio-elektrische Impedantie Analyse), lichaamsgewicht, Body Mass Index, middel-heup omtrek, energie-inname (3 daags voedingsdagboek), eetlust (cijferschaal), smaak- en voedselvoorkeuren (vragenlijst) gemeten. Om verschillen tussen de groepen (MtF en FtM) te toetsen op significantie (p ≤0,05), werd gebruik gemaakt van een independent samples t-test en van een Mann- Whitney U test. Na 3 maanden werden veranderingen per groep getoetst door middel van een paired samples t-test en van een Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Bij het literatuuronderzoek werden artikelen gebruikt met een Impact Factor van 1,5 of hoger en een level of evidence van A1 of A2 niveau (B en/of C niveau bij onvoldoende beschikbare literatuur). Resultaten: Na 3 maanden cross-sex hormoonbehandeling was er een borderline significante daling in ruststofwisseling bij MtF transgenders zichtbaar (p=0,075). Bij FtM transgenders werd er geen verandering in ruststofwisseling gemeten (p=0,686). Beide groepen lieten geen significant verschil in lichaamsgewicht, BMI en middel-heup ratio zien. Vetmassa nam significant toe (p=0,046) bij MtF, bij FtM bleef de vetmassa na 3 maanden onveranderd. MtF toonden een significante (p=0,046) daling in vetvrije massa aan. Daarentegen was er een borderline significante stijging in vetvrije massa bij FtM zichtbaar (p=0,080). Tussen een verandering in vetvrije massa en een verandering in ruststofwisseling, was in beide groepen geen significant verband waarneembaar. De energie-inname nam alleen bij FtM significant (p=0,046) toe. In eetlust, smaak- en voedselvoorkeuren was bij beide groepen geen significante verandering zichtbaar na 3 maanden. Conclusie: 3 maanden cross-sex hormoonbehandeling heeft geen significant effect op de ruststofwisseling van zowel MtF- als FtM transgenders. Vetmassa en vetvrije massa veranderen significant bij MtF. Eetlust verandert niet bij beide groepen, echter energie-inname neemt significant toe bij FtM. In smaak- en voedselvoorkeuren treedt eveneens bij beide groepen geen verandering op.",

      "title": "Genetic Load",
      "abstract": "Abstract Genetic load is the reduction in the mean fitness of a population relative to a population composed entirely of individuals having optimal genotypes. Load can be caused by recurrent deleterious mutations, genetic drift, recombination affecting epistatically favourable gene combinations, or other genetic processes. Genetic load potentially can cause the mean fitness of a population to be greatly reduced relative to populations without sources of less fit genotypes. Mutation load can be difficult or impossible to measure. Many species have mutation rates low enough that substantial genetic load is not expected, but for others, such as humans, the mutation rate may be great enough that load can be substantial. In extremely small populations, drift load, caused by the fixation by drift of weakly deleterious mutations, can threaten the probability of persistence of the population. Migration from other populations adapted to different local conditions can bring in locally maladapted alleles, resulting in migration load. Key Concepts: Genetic load is the reduction in mean fitness of a population caused by some population genetic process. Mutation load is the reduction in fitness caused by recurrent deleterious mutations. Mutation load may be as great as 95% for the human population. Drift load is the reduction in mean fitness caused by genetic drift. In extreme cases, deleterious alleles can reach a frequency of one in a population because of genetic drift. Genetic load can also be caused by recombination breaking up beneficial combinations of alleles, segregation reducing the frequency of fit heterozygotes, or migration bringing less fit alleles into a local population.",

      "abstract": "The need to recognise and accommodate the individual athlete, when working with youth populations, is arguably more pertinent than when working with adult athletes. The application of determining athlete maturity is of relevance given that children mature at a tempo that is individual to them and independent of chronological age groupings that are often used in competition. Despite the plethora of growth and maturation related research, the transfer from theory to practice can often be ambiguous and confusing. 'Growth' refers to the process by which something has increased in size as a whole whereas, 'maturation' refers to the process towards a mature state and can be established using indicators of maturity, which include skeletal maturation, somatic maturation and sexual maturation. Due to the added complexities of growth and maturation within youth populations, research examining adult training programmes and exercise physiology cannot simply be extrapolated to youth athletes.",

      "title": "Defying Secular Trend",
      "abstract": "The secular variation of biological anthropology tends to assess the degree of socio-economic development that is why nations try hard to achieve better secular trends of growth. Taller height has been often described as a sign of social status and privilege, therefore it became a personal as well as a society wish. Generally, in the last decades, stature tends to stabilize; however, weight continues to grow causing overweight to take pandemic forms. Nutrition and genetics are the main determinants of height trends and since maximum genetic potential can be restrained; nutrition takes the lead. Growth acceleration, during pursuit of positive height trend, correlates with long-term health problems in humans. most studies show a positive association between rapid growth (height, weight, or both) and increased overweight and obesity, regardless of age. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to defy the secular trend and achieve a better height potential without the health burdens of excess weight. Protein quality rather than quantity is what truly makes a difference in height. Although nutrition in most countries can be raised by rational dietary guidelines, the deterioration of the protein index, even in the wealthiest nations, is alarming.",

Less is known about the long-term effects of unwanted or unplanned pregnancy on the child and his or her personality. Here we examined in one correlational study and three experiments the associations between birth status (being unwanted, unplanned, or neither) and adult attachment. In general, being unwanted, and to a lesser extent unplanned, was associated with attachment insecurity. Priming thoughts about being an unwanted baby resulted in decreased state attachment security and increased state attachment insecurity. These findings suggest that birth status and knowledge about it play a role not only in parents’ but also in children’s lives—affecting their attachment and mental representation into adulthood.",

The present study examines whether the stigma of obesity in romantic relationships carries over to formerly obese individuals by using primary data collected from a Midwestern university in the United States ( N = 363). We consider how an individual's own body weight, demographic characteristics, familiarity, and attitudes affect the willingness to form a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person. Results suggest that obese individuals are less likely to hesitate about engaging in a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person than underweight or normal weight individuals, but only when attitudes toward obese and formerly obese individuals are controlled. In terms of demographic characteristics, men and African Americans are more likely to hesitate about forming a romantic relationship than their respective counterparts. More familiarity with currently obese family members and formerly obese close friends appears to reduce the stigma minimally. Greater social distance is also desired if weight loss is believed to be temporary.",

In experimental animals, and probably in the human, established nutritional habits are particularly potent factors in determining food intake. Proper nutritional education in early childhood may establish patterns of food selection that will be helpful in avoiding specific deficiencies and gross excesses in later life. Appetite may prove adequate for selection of a nutritionally acceptable diet under certain circumstances but selection of food on the basis of nutritional principles is more reliable and is to be recommended. A knowledge of normal variations in food intake in relation to age, sex, environmental temperature, and caloric expenditure is beneficial in interpreting the feeding behavior of children. Complaints by parents that their children have \"poor appetites,\" are commonly based on a misconception regarding normal patterns of food intake. Vitamins, iron, and other specific nutrients act as appetite stimulants only in the presence of deficiency of the particular nutrient.",

      "abstract": "Body image is an important component of women’s physical and mental health. Body dissatisfaction, a negative subjective evaluation of one’s body, has long been associated with disordered eating, obesity, depression, and low self-esteem. Body dissatisfaction is prevalent among women generally but may be less so among lesbian women as the result of a lower emphasis on physical appearance within lesbian culture, a greater valuing of larger body types among lesbian women, and lesbian women feeling less subject to male-defined standards. If so, understanding lesbian and heterosexual differences and lesbian-specific influences on body dissatisfaction could have important implications for body image research and women’s health efforts.\nMany studies that have explored lesbian and heterosexual differences in body dissatisfaction have suffered from methodological limitations and have not been theoretically based. Additionally, key variables known to influence other aspects of lesbian health, such as minority stress and sexual identity development, have not been well explored. I addressed both empirical and theoretical limitations of past research within a community sample of 879 lesbian and heterosexual women. I contrasted the two sexual identity groups on several widely used body dissatisfaction measures, controlling for clinician-collected data on BMI and key demographic covariates. As predicted, lesbian women reported significantly less body dissatisfaction than did heterosexual women on three of four measures. A structural equation model of proposed risk and protective factors for body dissatisfaction among lesbian women did not reveal significant relationships between these predictors and body dissatisfaction. This study represents a first attempt at modeling theoretically-derived, culturally-specific influences on lesbian women’s body image. Given demonstrated differences in lesbian and heterosexual women’s body dissatisfaction it is important to continue to explore body image among this sexual minority group. I discuss implications for future research.",

      "abstract": "A combination of biological factors such as earlier age at puberty and fecundity, and social factors such as the disappearance of the extended family and of rites of passage and the development of a youth culture have encouraged adolescent sexuality at the same time that length of schooling is increasing and adolescents have not yet become socially autonomous. Adolescents employ contraception relatively infrequently and tend to choose less reliable methods. Reasons for this include ignorance of the biology of reproduction and of contraception methods; the fear of secondary effects, encouraged by the mass media; lack of access to family planning facilities or fear that parents will be informed; and the cost of contraceptives. An adolescent requesting contraception should be treated as a adult, taking into account the degree of maturity; the attitude of the medial practitioner will influence motivation and success in using the method. The medical history will indicate cases in which a hormonal contraceptive is contraindicated. The gynecological examination reveals the gynecological age of the patient, which is more important than chronological age. The frequency of sexual realtions should also be considered in the choice. Because motivation of adolescents is less reliable than that of adults, such methods as rhythm and withdrawal are not appropriate. Condoms or diaphragms are disliked because of the necessity of repeated manipulation before each act of intercourse, but may be acceptable to highly motivated individuals. Condoms are indicated when relations are unexpected and infrequent. IUDs are indicated only when hormonal contraceptives cannot be used and when forgetting of pills is likely to occur. Nevertheless, IUD use in adolescents can entail serious problems of expulsion or of infection that may lead to later infertility. Little is known of the effects of oral contraceptive use on sexual maturation and growth of very young adolescents, but because of the growth inhibiting effects of estrogens, they should not be prescribed earlier than 2 years postmenarche. Low dose pills should be chosen. Sequential pills are preferable for patients with irregular cycles. High doses of steroids administered within 48 hours should be available in cases of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, an IUD may be inserted within 5 days.",

Despite this, few studies have been conducted on factors influencing adolescent's vegetarian diet-related attitudes. Through self-administered loosely structured interviews, this research investigated factors potentially associated with vegetarian choices in adolescence. It checked (a) gender differences in vegetarian choices; (b) religious, familial, ethical, or health factors implied in vegetarian choices; and (c) indicators of well-being among young vegetarians. The findings suggest that for our sample, non-vegetarians have lower scores on health-related questions than others, while for vegetarian adolescents, the benefits of vegetarianism mainly depend on their ethical stances, beliefs, and values. Conversely, it is unrelated to factors such as the desire to lose weight, dissatisfaction about one's body shape, or depressive feelings.",

      "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, the majority of adults over the age of 65 are physically and psychologically healthy. They are not cognitively deficient, socially isolated, or lonely, nor do they drain society's resources. They are aging well, and to the extent that they are able to engage in valued activities, they will continue to do so. A key component of adapting to growing older is the ability to maintain the sense of personal control that can be threatened by normal aging processes. The Activity Restriction Model of Depressed Affect proposes that to age successfully is to maintain physical and cognitive functioning via engagement in personally meaningful activities. Indeed, activity restriction—or the inability to continue normal activities that often follows stressful life events such as debilitating illness—is a major factor in poorer mental health outcomes. Potential contributors to activity restriction and depression are identified. Interventions to reduce activity restriction in older adults should focus on promoting manageable activities, taking into consideration individual differences in functional, psychological, and social resources.",

The chapter also focuses on the aspects of sexual life directly linked to health; however, one should never forget that adolescents who are not sexually active are still sexual beings, and sexual experience and intercourse is just one aspect or dimension of sexuality among those teenagers who are sexually active. The development and acknowledgement of sexual orientation plays an important role in the formation of adult identity. Adolescents suffering from chronic diseases and/or disability often face difficulties in integrating a defective body within their sexual development.",

      "title": "Violência sexual : impactos sobre o desenvolvimento da autoconsciência e autorrepresentações do self no ciclo de vida",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence against children and adolescents, a modality of sexual violence, is characterized as any sexual act or game, established in heterosexual or homosexual relationships, involving one or more adults and a child or adolescent, aiming at sexually stimulating the victim, or using it to obtain sexual stimulation in erotic, pornographic and sexual practices imposed through enticement, physical force or threats. Considered a public health problem and violation of human rights, this phenomenon produces serious biopsychosocial consequences, including feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, impairment of physical and emotional development, making victims more vulnerable to suicide ideas and attempts, as well as psychosomatic illnesses and sexually transmitted. Although scientific studies have pointed out the consequences of sexual violence in childhood and adolescence on the physical and emotional dimensions of victims, little is known about its influence on the development of self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. Based on these assumptions, this study investigates the impacts of sexual violence on self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. It is characterized as a cross-sectional and comparative study, involving two groups of participating subjects, divided between victims and non-victims of sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence. Its sample is composed of 236 subjects, between youth and adults, of both sexes, university students and from different economic classes. The investigation consists of three interlaced studies, the first of which is an ex-post-facto type, in which the participants answered the handout containing a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric instruments; and, the second and third, multiple case studies, of the phenomenal and qualitative type, based on semi-structured interviews, using a thematic script. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, Pearson, Spearman and Pearson Bisserial correlation tests, Student's t test, Multiple Regression Techniques, and Similarity Structure Analysis. The qualitative data followed the interpretative model of the double hermeneutics, proposed by Giddens (1984), by which it is possible to unveil the meanings that the subjects themselves constraint from their actions, compared with the sense that the analysts, from theoretical and methodological constructs build in relation to the actions and interpretations of their interlocutors (Geertz, 1987).. Thus, we sought broader understandings about the impacts of sexual violence on the structuring of self-awareness and self-representations of the self; as well as about the aggravating factors for the occurrence of the phenomenon in childhood and adolescence; and, on the meanings attributed to them by those who have violated their bodies and intimacy, which is fundamental to the most accurate understanding of sexual violence in the life cycle.",

This opinion piece aims to highlight that although people with excessive sitting and insufficient moderate-to-vigorous physical activity should sit more and move less, for other people their health would be promoted by sitting more and moving less. Thus, physical behaviors are not always \"poison\" or \"medicine,\" but rather the health impact of changes in physical behaviors depends on people's initial levels. Policy, research, and practice implications of this realization are presented. Only tailoring messaging to age and health status could be far from optimal for people with very different current levels of physical behaviors. Policy, research, and practice will be enhanced when the potential for physical behaviors to be either health hindering or health promoting is adequately considered.",

      "abstract": "Puberty is a complex transition that involves dramatic changes in several domains of human development including biological, physical, psychological, and social [1]. Individual variations in the timing of puberty may influence the adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Specifically, compare to those who mature on-time or late, adolescents who mature early are at a higher risk of exposure to several psychological, social, and health disadvantages [2]. For instance, girls who experience puberty earlier than their counterparts are more susceptible to adverse health behavior such as earlier alcohol use [3], cigarette smoking [4], and eating disorder [5]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that early timing of puberty among girls is also associated with decline in physical activity (PA) [6], and an increased time spent in sedentary behavior (SB) [7]. Only a few studies have examined the relationship between puberty and body mass index (BMI) among boys by using different measures (e.g., voice break, age at onset of pubertal growth spurt, peak height velocity (PHV), public hair growth, testicular volume, and/or penis length), the results have been inconsistent [8]. However, a recent study examining the trend of age at spermarche and its association with BMI among Chinese school boys found that a higher BMI or BMI-for-age z-score was associated with an increased likelihood of having reached spermarche, indicating the overlapping trend of earlier age at spermarche and increase in BMI over the past 15 years among Chinese boys [9].",

      "abstract": "El envejecimiento ha sido definido como un proceso progresivo, intrinseco y universal que conduce finalmente a la muerte y en tal sentido, se encuentra generalmente asociado a connotaciones negativas como la discapacidad y la enfermedad. En las ultimas decadas hay una tendencia a separar las nociones de discapacidad y enfermedad del envejecimiento, de tal manera que puedan diferenciarse las consecuencias de la exposicion a factores estresantes del proceso de envejecimiento en si mismo. Una gran parte de los trabajos de investigacion muestra que las personas que envejecen con un alto grado de deterioro fisico y cognitivo, muestran historia de exposicion a ambientes estresantes, deficiencias en la alimentacion, escasa actividad fisica, limitadas redes de contencion social y menoscabo socioemocional. Coincidentemente se viene sosteniendo desde hace varias decadas, que el envejecimiento puede ser atenuado por factores ambientales controlados como la adecuada nutricion, la actividad fisica, y una vida social plena. En tal sentido recuperamos el concepto de envejecimiento saludable, entendido como la salud fisica y mental, que incluye el concepto subjetivo de bienestar, el apoyo social y las redes vinculares.\r\nEn lo que respecta al proceso ontogenetico humano, la antropologia se ha preocupado en gran medida por la diversidad en el crecimiento y el desarrollo, pero muy superficialmente por la variabilidad presente en la vejez. Al ser el envejecimiento un proceso que se inicia durante el crecimiento y desarrollo y que se encuentra influenciado por la calidad de vida desde periodos muy tempranos de la ontogenia, este no puede ser entendido en su diversidad sin tener en cuenta la historia de acceso a derechos como la salud, la educacion, la alimentacion, el medio ambiente adecuado y una vida social plena. El concepto de fragilidad permite dar cuenta de esa variabilidad y la discute en torno a la calidad de vida y los derechos fundamentales. En su definicion formal, la fragilidad incluye multiples dominios del funcionamiento humano tanto biologicos como psicologicos y sociales, por lo que resulta un poderoso instrumento para evaluar el acceso a derechos economicos, sociales y culturales. En un modelo social y comunicacional de idealizacion que promueve la vida eterna como una meta -en contradiccion con todos los conocimientos que tenemos acerca de la biologia ontogenetica- discutimos el concepto de envejecimiento saludable y los instrumentos de evaluacion de la fragilidad como dispositivos de monitoreo de derechos humanos en adultos mayores.",

      "title": "Transgenerational healing",
      "abstract": "Although our continuing evolution can never achieve our perfection, we long for our children’s birth and health to be near-perfect. Many children are born healthy, though fewer than is possible. Birthing and health rapidly improved generally due to modern housing, sanitation and medicine, as well as birth interventions. Arguably interventions have exceeded the optimal level, without enough regard for natural physical and intuitive resources. Conception, often too easy, receives too little personal preparation unless a couple has problems. Nurturing the health of sperm and ovum seems hard to focus on, yet is needed by both parents – and even by the four grandparents. What are the key factors? Positive: The fields of hormones/emotions and of nutrition/metabolism. Negative: stress, poor nutrition, toxins, diseases; much being due to poverty. Positive and negative both have structural and also epigenetic effects. Interventions, essential or inessential, are seldom without negative side effects. Health can best, and most economically, be generated at the beginning of life, through healthy conception, gestation and birth. Understanding prime needs improves initial health. It also informs therapy of any early-life problems. Healing is therefore more efficient when transgenerational, and much more powerful than individual healing. My vision of healing is safeguarding our evolution in progress. Children's choices – eating, exercise, emotional attitudes and relationships – are already profoundly affecting any children they may have, their mental and physical health. The most practical starting point seems to be educating boys as well as girls. Childhood is therefore the time to educate them in choices. The correction of often unnoticed problems– nutrient deficits, toxins, uro-genital disease – has enabled nearly nine out of ten couples to bear fully healthy babies, even following severe problems – infertility, miscarriages, stillbirths and malformations. Correcting problems before conception prevents both structural faults and wrong setting of gene-switches. Children's habits set. Once courting most are preoccupied and many pregnant unintentionally. Childhood is the time to be adopting a healthy lifestyle, the way to healthy babies The mother's nutritional and emotional status throughout pregnancy continues to affect her child's future physical and mental health, behaviour and ability. Before conception a woman needs to build her appropriate body stores – vitamins and minerals, proteins, docosahexaenoic acid. Before bearing another child, a replenishment time of 3 years is desirable. A return to childbearing in the 20s and early 30s could reduce risks that have risen with the recent shift towards conception by school children and by women in their late 30s or more. Governments, schoolteachers, health professionals, need to adopt this policy of transgenerational health. Empowerment with knowledge is the one way to fend off the growing pandemic of mental ill health and related disorders and to make the most of a nation's genetic potential. Financially there could be no better investment, let alone in enhancing people's lives. Childhood is the most appropriate time for education in this way to generating a healthy, able and peaceful human race. Essential to our amazing genetic systems are the resources of land, sea and air. We are one with our biosphere. We need urgently to follow up the vital work of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, and of Far East initiatives in sea-bed and sea husbandry.",

      "abstract": "Living things depend on a flow of energy and materials to grow, reproduce, and maintain their bodies. Populations are aggregations of individuals, so they too depend on resources. Humans use many fuels derived from the Earth’s photosynthetic energy, which in turn support a population that often occurs at unusually high densities for a mammal. Like most populations, growing human populations may experience negative feedbacks from population size unless the socio-economic system in which the population lives grows fast enough to maintain resource flows to individuals and to limit the downsides of high density. I map out a simple view of the pathways of density dependence through five main causes of negative feedback: poor nutrition, increased disease, increased toxins, altered life history strategies, and violent conflict. The pathways trace the different ways in which increasing population size can cause lower birth rates or higher death rates and set the stage for selection on contemporary human populations. Some of the pathways are not traditionally viewed as density-dependent, but since they all depend on a tension between population size and the ability of the socio-economic system to generate positive feedbacks, they are all a form of density-dependence. These pathways are also dependent on changes to the global environment, including warmer and more variable climates, and the way people respond to the feedbacks by altering socio-economic expectations or technology.",

Frontal lobe maturation consisting of explosive dendritic/synaptic growth and pruning modulates affect emerging from the amygdala, a process called frontalization. Greater powers of abstraction propel adolescents into new perspectives on their world requiring each adolescent to meet several new intertwined psychological challenges, including formation of values and a separate identify beyond simpler childhood notions, becoming autonomous in thought and feeling, choosing a peer group and finding transcendence and meaning in their life. Marijuana not only interferes with the neurodevelopment necessary to meet these psychological developmental tasks, but it also confuses adolescents by seeming to accelerate maturation while actually delaying it. Declaring autonomy and separation by smoking a joint, for example, produces a simulacrum of maturity without requiring the underlying psychological work that is ultimately necessary for launching into successfull adulthood.",

However, little research has been undertaken to explicate the factors implicated in the divergence of male body image disorders amongst body dissatisfied males towards either thinness or muscularity oriented body image concerns. We aim to review several constructs which have been explored in attempting to better understand the causal pathway into this divergence, including sexuality and gender role identification. Gender role orientation may be particularly relevant in underpinning this divergence, in that masculinity is likely implicated in the drive for muscularity, whereas femininity is implicated in the drive for thinness amongst body dissatisfied males. Suggestions and implications for future research in further explicating the role of gender role orientation in the divergence of male body image psychopathology are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although sexuality is valued throughout the lifespan, older women's sexual expression can be influenced by physical, mental and social factors, including attitudes and stereotypes held by younger generations. By gaining an understanding of what influences negative attitudes toward sexuality and beliefs about sexual consent capacity, the stigma associated with sexuality in late life may be reduced. Method: Using vignette methodology in an online survey, we examined older women's health and young adults' (N = 606; mean age = 18.86, SD = 1.42, range 17–36) general knowledge and attitudes toward aging and sexuality, personal sexual behavior, religious beliefs and perceived closeness with an older adult on attitudes towards sexual behavior and perceptions of consent capacity among older women. Results: The health status of older women proved important in determining young adults' acceptance and perception of sexual consent capacity regarding late-life heterosexual/autoerotic and homosexual behaviors. Specifically, young adults expressed lower acceptance and more doubt regarding capacity to consent to sexual expression when the older woman was described as cognitively impaired. Additionally, young adults' personal attitudes toward late-life sexuality, but not knowledge, predicted acceptance toward sexual expression and belief in sexual consent capacity. Conclusion: Attention toward the influence of older women's cognitive health and young adults' attitudes toward late-life sexuality may prove beneficial in designing interventions to decrease the stigma associated with sexual activity in later life.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a period of physical, intellectual, emotional, and social change, and many social challenges. These characteristics raise important questions about the neural changes specific to this developmental period. This model is also used to generate new ideas. We also think that pubertal hormones have a significant effect on the restructuring of neural circuits that support facial processing, and especially on the restructuring of functional connectivity or physical connections between regions. Otherwise, facial function would emerge as new products are made in the face during youth and change. Generational differences are a social phenomenon in every society. As people age, conflicts become worse. Today, due to the fast pace of modern life, it has become difficult to overcome the generation gap. whether young people see cultural change differently than previous generations, how technology affects the impact on thinking, and how important organizational interventions are to reduce injustice and improve health. According to the statistics of the data, the following nine variables are common Watching porn, escaping/skipping school, falling in love, eating late at night, partying at night, falling in love, running away, extramarital affairs. It has been found that marriage, sex, intermarriage, and divorce positively affect the perception of young people who are related. Adolescents' trust in schools often affects their perspective on their own prejudices. The greater the belief, the smaller the prejudice, and vice versa. The data from this study shows that the youth have lost trust in institutions that can take many forms such as education, religion, family, work, social, legal or political. youth culture in Madhya Pradesh that are affected by new technologies, creating negative stereotypes and alienation among young girls. Therefore, in order to maintain physical and mental health, there must be an impact on the time of life organizations. While the youth have become independent and in some cases wasteful, the economic power of middle-income countries has increased as the workforce of the elderly has increased. The youth referred to here refers to the age group of 14-30. With the rapid growth of the economy, the purchasing process is also changing. The 15-30 age group is a part of the society immortalized in advertising. The West portrays these youth as penniless and thoughtless, but the situation is different in India. Although money is in the hands of parents until the age of 25-26, there is a difference in the behaviour of young people in our country. young people in the city of Indore. The generation gap between young people and their parents by examining the changes in attitudes and behaviours as people transition from youth to adulthood. Our findings show that there is a significant shift from care-seeking and social relationships in adolescence to values of independence and desire to hide in adulthood. While 50% of young people and 40% of parents agree that there is a generation gap, 50% of young people and 60% of parents believe that there is a good understanding despite frequent arguments. It is important for parents to avoid conflict. The need for effective communication and consensus to bridge generation gaps, supports the transition to adulthood, and improves relationships between young and old parents. People are more resistant to change and will not adapt unless it affects their own health. The difference in outcomes across several generations may be greater than the difference between parents and children in the same family. Students share many values with their parents but have different moral values from their parents’ generation. Therefore, a generation gap, or at least a large generation gap, may emerge without considering the impact of the importance of parents and children.",

Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility), or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness. Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. ### Responses to infertility In response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may have several effects on sexual activity. The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability. For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begins a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures. Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress. Some individuals feel that their partner seems to want them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control. #### Useful questions to elicit information",

The question of growth hormone therapy for a short, but otherwise normal child is still controversial. The justification for such treatment will depend not only on whether a marked improvement in height can be achieved but also on whether short stature can be shown to be an appreciable handicap, either in childhood or later in life. There is some evidence, though much is anecdotal, to suggest that the short statured adult is disadvantaged both socially and economically. There are no conclusive data as yet, however, to suggest that short statured children, either before or during early adolescence have significantly lower scores on conventional psychometric testing than children of average stature. Possibly, the problems associated with short stature will only emerge in the older adolescent, but for the present, alternative, less expensive forms of treatment should be considered for those children apparently unable to cope.",

      "abstract": "Structured interviews with 3.5-12-year-old children and their mothers were directed at documenting the development of 4 psychological categories of food rejection. The first to appear is rejection based purely on sensory characteristics, usually taste ( distastes ). Rejection based purely on anticipated harm following ingestion appears next (danger). Finally, the oldest children and adults show rejection based on the idea of what something is or where it comes from. This ideational type of rejection further differentiates into affectively laden rejections of substances that become offensive ( disgusts ) and more neutral rejections of substances as simply not food (inappropriate). A critical psychological feature of disgusting substances in adults is that they are \"contaminants\": they render an otherwise liked food inedible if present even in trace amounts, or if associated with a liked food. Contamination sensitivity is not present in the younger subjects, and appears gradually in the age range studied. Young children are unaware of the physical chemistry of solutions (e.g., diffusion and its lack of reversibility) and therefore do not show a \"contamination response.\"",

At this stage the sex glands have not yet begun the rapid development of puberty with its profound effect on the whole organism. Curiously enough there is a sudden increase in the rate of growth which takes place at this time. In fact, we may consider boys in the period of prepubescence as individuals of adult form but of small size, growing rapidly, and as yet scarcely influenced by the internal secretions of the sex glands.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of great physiological and psychological change. Individuals have to progress from the dependence of childhood to the independence and maturity of the adult state whilst they are still regarded by many adults as predominantly children. Adolescents have to cope with the central problem of identity and of motivation and ambitions. They have to come to terms with the perceptions and judgements of other people on them and often experience stress in situations where they feel they are unable to reach the ideals of themselves or of others. Relationships with the opposite sex and acceptance by friends become crucial since they are the only means of judging one's self-value until the individual has achieved a reasonable degree of confidence and self-integration. This dependence on the opinions of others or on perhaps inappropriate ideals can lead to strong feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in adolescents. Adults obviously face similar problems but the myriad of physical and physiological changes which adolescents experience serve to heighten their emotional sensitivity. As a consequence of these adjustment problems, adolescence is often a period of unrest, of questioning and sometimes of outright rebellion and hostility.",

This chapter examines orthorexia—a condition in which the subject becomes obsessed with identifying and maintaining the ideal diet, rigidly avoiding foods perceived as unhealthy or harmful—and it argues that the condition represents an extreme manifestation of sociocultural norms that people are all being pushed toward. These norms are highly gendered, however, and women and men are thus sometimes portrayed as if they were striving toward radically different goals in the elusive quest for perfect health. Yet what makes orthorexia destructive to both men and women is ultimately a common urge to transcend rather than to embrace the realities of embodiment. In short, orthorexia is best understood as a manifestation of age-old anxieties about human finitude and mortality—anxieties that current dominant sociocultural forces prime people to experience and express in unhealthy attitudes toward healthy eating.",

The present study indicates that decreased physical activity may play a role in the production and maintenance of the obesity of at least some persons. Obese women appear to be far less active than nonobese women, and this difference in activity is paralleled by differences in attitudes toward activity. An investigation of the reasons for this decreased activity indicates that physical activity in man is determined by a variety of influences: biological, social, and emotional. One of the most important and most common of these influences is the series of events associated with a depressive reaction pattern. Depression, thus, may not be a purely incidental occurrence in obese persons. It may be one of the main reasons why they are obese.",

Mussen and M. D.

The young adolescent is still very much a child at this stage, who depends on family, is concerned about body changes, and is prone to anxiety. Adolescent girls who mature early are at greater risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms than are girls who mature at the \"normal\" time, and get into more behavioral problems.

Dieters were also found to be highly and negatively self-focused on the Exner Sentence Completion Task (J. E. Exner, 1973). Moreover, dieting status was correlated with public rather than private selfconsciousness, suggesting that dieters are concerned with their public image. Taken together, these data suggest that some women may be motivated to diet in part because of intense self-focus about their current self-perception of being overweight.",

      "title": "Growth and maturation",
      "abstract": "Abstract The concepts of a child’s growth and maturation are central to all studies related to paediatric exercise science. It is imperative that any studies investigating responses to exercise and/or physical activity take into consideration the growth and maturity status of the participant. Distinguishing influences of physical activity and/or exercise on growth from those associated with normal growth and development is problematic. This is because the effects of normal growth and maturation can mask those associated with exercise. As children grow, they become taller and heavier, they increase their lean and fat tissues, and their organs increase in size, which all affect performance outcomes. Children also mature into the adult state. The major distinction between size per se and maturation is that all children eventually achieve the same adult maturity, whereas adult size and body dimensions vary considerably. It is therefore important to remember that growth and maturation occur simultaneously and interact. There are also sex differences with girls reaching maturity, on average, 2 years earlier than boys. However, both sexes show the same patterns in growth, both in terms of the curve of growth and the changes in proportionality. There is wide variation among children both within and between sexes as to the exact timing and tempo of maturation. Therefore, to adequately distinguish the effects of exercise and/or physical activity on a group of children, biological maturity needs to be controlled. The most widely used methods to assess maturity are skeletal maturity, sexual maturity, and somatic or morphological maturity.",

This research examines people's beliefs about what other people with heavy versus thin body types enjoy, in terms of food and activities. Predictions of others' enjoyment are important, as they can shape various downstream judgments, including beliefs about other people's likely goal pursuit success, and recommendations and choices for others. Six pre-registered experiments compare predictions of others' enjoyment of healthy and unhealthy foods and activities, based on whether others have heavy versus thin body types. These experiments show that whereas beliefs about what people with thin body types enjoy are flexible, beliefs about what people with heavy body types enjoy are narrow and inflexible. Specifically, if people with thin body types engage in counter-stereotypical unhealthy behavior, they are perceived to enjoy such behavior as much as people with heavy body types. By contrast, even if people with heavy body types engage in counter-stereotypical healthy behavior, they are perceived not to enjoy such behavior as much as people with thin body types. The potential wide-ranging implications of the belief that heavy people have narrower ranges of potential enjoyment are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the relationships between nutrition, life span, and sex. It considers the view that dietary restriction without severe malnutrition prolongs life. It is generally believed that the benefits of dietary restriction arise from eating fewer calories. However, Geometric Framework experiments on insects in which the effects of macronutrients have been separated indicate that, rather than calories, a key determinant of the relationship between diet and longevity is the balance of protein to nonprotein (fat and/or carbohydrate) energy in the diet. Meanwhile, the presumption in much of life history theory that life span and reproduction trade off against each other for limiting resources is shown to be too simplistic. These two life-history variables certainly have differing nutritional optima, but they can be dissociated and do not inevitably trade off. Reproductive senescence and aging may proceed at different rates in males and females, as predicted by sexual selection theory.",

      "abstract": "Sex assignment of children born with ambiguous genitalia is a difficult and responsible decision based on limited empirical evidence regarding future development of gender identity/role, sexual orientation, and sexual functioning. Sex of assignment and rearing has appeared to be a prognosticator of future gender identity, usually better than the other criteria of sex (chromosomes, gonadal tissue, prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles). The decision to assign a sex is guided by the prognosis of the ``optimal'' sex for the newborn, of which the elements are an overall sex-appropriate appearance with a stable gender identity; good sexual function, preferably combined with reproductive function if attainable; minimal medical procedures; and a reasonably happy life given the limitations. The limited follow-up studies indicate that this is a reasonable policy, although a limited number of subjects will experience gender dysphoria later in life and will cross over to the other sex. This is more often the case in subjects assigned to the female sex with considerable prenatal or postnatal androgen exposure. Children in this predicament must receive guidance well into adulthood. It may be difficult to engage in sexual relations when the anatomy of the genitalia (often operated upon) is not fully normal.",

However, small subgroups of obese individuals may have psychiatric abnormalities which are specific for obesity, such as body image disturbance or periodic compulsive overeating (bulimia). Obesity is strongly related to sociocultural factors. In western countries obesity is commoner in lower than in higher social classes. Thus, the development of obesity is influenced by social status. However, also the converse is true: recent observations suggest that obese people lose social status. This is probably due to prejudice and discrimination against obese persons in the modern western society.",

      "abstract": "With increasing age, cellular senescence and physiological dysregulation proceed, reducing somatic resilience, increasing frailty, and leading to increased physical disability, morbidity, and mortality. By promoting variability in somatic outcomes, developmental processes and environmental and ecological settings set the stage for senescent biology and variable lifespans. Early life adversity forces organisms to expend more physiological capacity resisting stressors, while environments limiting stressor exposures promote greater physiological reserve and resilience. At reproductive maturity, somatic resources are reallocated toward reproductive effort. Individual and familial patterns of morbidity and longevity attest to genetic influences on lifespan, but few specific alleles and haplotypes are associated with human lifespan. Stressor exposures are a major contributor to age‐related losses of functional abilities (frailty) and physiological dysfunction (allostatic load). Reduced physical activity at older ages promotes osteopenia and sarcopenia, twin biomarkers of frailty, and frailty indices reflect age‐related senescent losses. Age‐related physiological dysregulation and frailty are inherent to living systems as life cannot simultaneously optimize all physiological functions, protect their somas from all environmental insults, and still be reproductively successful.",

Studies on intelligence ranking show that there is both substantial stability and considerable change in the rank-ordering of human intelligence across the lifespan. This is because the correlation coefficient used to measure stability is not perfect. Studies on intelligence decline show that our ability to perform different types of intelligence tests advances and declines with age. How is mental speed affected by age?",

In our country, the average age rose from 28.3 years in 2007 to 33.5 years in 2022, indicating a clear trend toward an aging society. With the growing elderly population, the field of andrology encounters diseases and risks associated with aging with increasing frequency. Advancing age in men can lead to a decline in testosterone levels, which can cause various physical and mental changes. These changes can include decreased sexual desire, erection problems, and declining sperm quality.

This research examined beliefs about the experience and expression of emotions across the life span, especially across the adult years.Younger and older adults rated the extent to which infants, children, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults were likely to experience and express a range of emotions.Younger and older adults held similar beliefs about the course of emotions across the life span. Moreover, these beliefs differed across emotion categories. In particular, although older adults were believed to experience and express fewer highly charged, negative emotions, they were expected to be more likely to experience and express positive, low arousal emotions, as well as negative, low arousal emotions. The experience and expression of positive, high arousal emotions were seen as more characteristic of very young age groups as opposed to older age groups.These findings beg questions about if and how beliefs about emotion may affect age-related emotion regulation strategies and other everyday emotion-focused behaviors, as well as social reactions to older adults observed experiencing and expressing particular types of emotions.",

The term adolescence refers rather loosely to the last of these three major phases, to the time during which the child becomes a man or woman. The earliest and latest changes of this transformation take place insidiously and are not easily recognized or defined. They reach back well into what is usually thought of as childhood, or the stable middle period of growth, and they extend forward into what is, in most respects, adulthood.

Such needs can be met by maintaining a balanced diet. It should not, however, be assumed that pregnant woman always have correct nourishment prior to pregnancy. The body experiences metabolic changes in order to face the changes that pregnancy entails, though each organism adapts differently to these changes, which makes it difficult to standardise the recommendations for women as a whole. Despite this, there are International Organisations that assume the task of establishing the dietary guidelines considered optimum for pregnancy. A rich and varied diet meets the requirements of pregnancy and lactation, but the needs increase in a different manner for each nutrient and the increase of intake should be selective. There should be particular control of proteins, essential fatty acids and certain vitamins (folic acid specially) and some minerals (such as calcium, phosphors, iron and zinc). Consequently, pregnancies with a risk of suffering nutritional alterations should be ruled out, the diet should be watched and, if necessary, specific dietary supplements should be used.",

For example, one's sense of gender is generally consolidated much earlier. Sexual identity may be somewhat fluid for adolescents, and experimentation is the norm. Adolescence may also be the time when cognitive and emotional difficulties first appear. Many factors can disrupt identity consolidation in adolescence. As always, traumas, family strife, and losses must be considered. A very common source of trouble in this area is drug and alcohol use disorders. Adult patients are likely to have strong memories of adolescence.",

      "abstract": "The growing demographic of nonreligious youth includes a range of individuals from the unaffiliated or “spirituals” to completely nonreligious atheists and agnostics. The latter tend to be overrepresented among the more highly educated, and display complex, analytical cognition. These emerging adults have personalities marked by high Openness to experience, but lower Agreeableness and social conformity. Nonreligious young adults are typically socially liberal with individualistic, nonauthoritarian values. Their family formation is often delayed, with fewer children and higher rates of singlehood and cohabitation. On one hand, those with low religiousness and infrequent church attendance tend to have more mental health problems and often report familial conflicts if they were raised religiously. However, confidently nonreligious youth in a supportive social context do not substantially differ from religious peers. More work is needed to separate the influences of nonbelief itself from other developmental and social factors.",

While obesity has been identified as a threat to our public health, correlating attitudes toward body image and self-concept have been explored within women to a limited extent, and even less so in relation to men. Consequently, men's body image will be discussed in light of current literature reveals for women. For men, as for women, as the social pressure to attain an \"ideal\" physique increases, the discrepancy between that ideal and one's body increases as well. This dynamic is more readily recognized for women than for men. As men are socialized not to discuss their body image concerns, negative self-concept and esteem may reinforce behaviors resulting in weight gain. In recent years, the proliferation of media has served to reinforce messaging related to one's body. This review of existing data and literature suggests that body image and self-concept are related to body weight in men (as with women) and need to be addressed as part of healthy weight management practices.",

In common discourse, eating disorders are often seen as the result of the pressure to be thin, operated by the media. Magazines and the media propose/impose an unnatural model of beauty, and young women fall in the trap of eating disorders in the effort to emulate their favourite top models. This chapter argues that eating disorders are not the products of fashion, but of some moral values that are strongly embodied in the western culture. According to the International Classification of Diseases, the disorder occurs most commonly in adolescent girls and young women, but adolescent boys and young men may also be affected, as may children approaching puberty.

It reviews the prevalence and presentation of EDs and associated behaviors among men, and compares these with those in women. EDs and disordered eating have been found to be higher among particular populations of men.

In industrial and postindustrial societies this passage depends less and less on the onset of old age and all that this entails-less physically able, a reduced intellectual capacity, and is increasingly linked to an economic and social value attributed to the individual on the basis of a change in occupational status following retirement. This change is usually classified according to outdated rules, which are no longer acceptable, so that the age at which one ‘s working life ends can often coincide with a stage when the individual concerned is by no means old (Livi Bacci, 1987; Egidi, 1990).",

In societies with fewer resource constraints, one might expect that these effects would be limited or non-existent. This study investigates the costs of brothers and sisters in a contemporary western society of adult Australians. Girls with elder brothers had a delayed age at menarche. Younger brothers were associated with delayed onset of sexual activity in sisters, but not in brothers. Neither younger nor elder brothers influenced fitness parameters (number of pregnancies, number of children, age at first pregnancy or age at first birth) in siblings of either sex. This study provides evidence that brothers negatively affect their sisters' onset of reproductive maturity and sexual activity; however, this delay is not associated with a fitness cost in contemporary Australia. We suggest this is due to the long period of independence prior to child bearing.",

The complexities in the relationships are in part due to the difficulties faced in appropriately appraising physical activity in young people. Physical fitness standards tend to be based on norms that have been established within a population. These norms do not provide useful information about what are acceptable fitness standards for young people of different ages. Physically fit young people may not necessarily also be physically active young people and there are concerns that the pattern of increased physical inactivity among young people may have a negative impact on their health status in later years. Current recommendations for young people mirror the thinking that discontinuous physical activity of a moderate intensity that is repeated many times over on a daily basis.青少年中體育活動與健康，體育活動與體能以及體能與健康之間有著複雜的關係併難以理順。之所以複雜，其部分原因是因為不能正確地評估青少年的體育活動。體能的標準往往基於大眾中建立的一些準則，而這些準則併不適用于不同年齡階段的青少年。體格較好的青少年併不一定都是那些經常參加體育活動的人。但在青少年中不參加體育活動的人數增加的現象卻令人擔憂，這將在今後的幾年中對他們的健康產生不良的影響。目前對青少年所推薦的體育活動形式是間斷性的中等強度的運動，即在一天中反覆多次的短時間運動。",

      "abstract": "This review organizes ideas on the evolution of life histories. The key life-history traits are brood size, size of young, the age distribution of reproductive effort, the interaction of reproductive effort with adutl mortality, and the variation in these traits among an individual's progeny. The general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations of traits will evolve in organisms living in specified circumstances. First consider single traits. Theorists have made the following predictions: (1) Where adult exceeds juvenile mortality, the organism should reproduce only once in its lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality, the organism should reproduce several times. (2) Brood size should maximize the number of young surviving to maturity, summed over the lifetime of the parent. But when optimum brood-size varies unpredictably in time, smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the chances of total failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding populations, selection should minimize age at maturity. In stable populations, when reproductive success depends on size, age, or social status, or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then maturation should be delayed, as it should be in declining populations. (4) Young should increase in size at birth with increased predation risk, and decrease in size with increased resource availability. Theorists have also predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur in specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations, age at maturity should be minimized, reproductive effort concentrated early in life, and brood size increased. (6) One view holds that in stable environments, late maturity, multiple broods, a few, large young, parental care, and small reproductive efforts should be favored (K-selection). In fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small young, reduced parental care, and large reproductive efforts should be favored (r-selection). (7) But another view holds that when juvenile mortality fluctuates more than adult mortality, the traits associated with stable and fluctuating environments should be reversed. We need experiments that test the assumptions and predictions reviewed here, more comprehensive theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions, and examination of different definitions of fitness.",

      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect refers to any act or failure to act that violates the rights of children and affects their overall optimal health, survival or development. Also sexual abuse in children is defined as engaging a child in sexual acts that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the taboos of our society. Sexual abuse may involve direct acts perpetrated against children as well as other non-touching abuses, which include exhibitionism, voyeurism, or the use of children for pornographic purposes.Although precise incidence and prevalence rate data are lacking, sexual abuse of children is common in our country and throughout the world. Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that has frequently passed unrecognized and its victims (both children and perpetrators) untreated. Child sexual abuse results in significant social damage. The physical and psychological consequences of child sexual abuse may result in trauma and has implications throughout the lifespan. Experiencing sexual abuse as a child also has the consequence of contributing to an increased risk of violent victimization, perpetration, self-directed violence and suicide later in life.Despite the importance of the issues, information about sexual abuse in children and amongst adults has not been commonly shared by health professionals. The purpose of this review article is to assist the physician in their investigation of child sexual abuse by exploring the important topics.",

      "title": "Psychological correlates of habitual diet in healthy adults.",
      "abstract": "There are 3 motivations for studying the psychological correlates of habitual diet. First, diet is a major but modifiable cause of morbidity and mortality, and dietary interventions could be improved by knowing the psychological characteristics of consumers of healthy/unhealthy diets. Second, animal studies indicate that diet can impair cognition, stress responsiveness, and affective processing, but it is unclear whether this also happens in humans. Third, certain psychological traits are associated with obesity, but it is not known whether these precede and thus contribute to weight gain. Although many psychological correlates of diet have been identified, the literature is highly dispersed, and there has been no previous comprehensive narrative review. Organized here by psychological domain, studies linking diet with individual differences in perception, cognition, impulsivity, personality, affective processing, mental health, and attitudes, beliefs and values-in healthy adults-are reviewed. Although there is a growing literature on the psychological correlates of fruit/vegetable intake-the core of a healthy diet-consumers of unhealthy diets have characteristics that probably make them less responsive to education-based interventions. Diet may be a causal contributor to depression, and diet is consistently linked to impulsivity and certain personality traits. There are inconsistent and less explored links to perceptual, affective and cognitive processes, with several emerging parallels to the animal literature. Impulsivity and personality traits common to obese individuals also occur in lean consumers of unhealthy diets, suggesting these may contribute to weight gain. Diet-psychology correlates remain understudied even though this could significantly benefit human health. (PsycINFO Database Record",

      "title": "Nutrition and gender.",
      "abstract": "The socially constructed gender roles of men and women interact with their biological roles to affect the nutrition status of the entire family and of each gender. Because of women’s cyclical loss of iron and their childbearing their nutrition status is particularly vulnerable to deficiencies in diet care and health or sanitation services. Moreover the nutrition status of newborns and infants is intimately linked with the nutrition status of the mother before during and after pregnancy. Women typically have limited access to land education information credit technology and decision making forums. They have the primary responsibility for child rearing and rely on developed social networks that act as an informal safety net for the family in times of crisis. When involved in formal employment they typically command lower remuneration rates than their male colleagues even when they hold the same skills. Because of their triple burden of productive reproductive and social roles women also tend to have less time to attend to their own needs leisure related or otherwise. Poor female nutrition early in life reduces learning potential increases reproductive and maternal health risks and lowers productivity. This situation contributes to women’s diminished ability to gain access to other assets later in life and undermines attempts to eliminate gender inequalities. In essence women with poor nutrition are caught in a vicious circle of poverty and undernutrition. (excerpt)",

Concern about penile size can affect one’s self-esteem, which then affects its sexual function, satisfaction, as well as physical and mental health. Therefore, accurate penile measurements are needed for clinical and academic purposes. Reviews: Measurement of penile size can be performed in an erect, stretched, even flaccid condition. However, from various researches, there is no standardization of such a measurement method. Various researches have carried out average penile measurement but many factors can affect these results such as race, genital conditions, systemic diseases, surgical procedures, and aging. Summary: There is no internationally agreed way of measuring an adult male's penis and many other factors can make the results of penile measurements vary. Proper measurement and finding out the right average of penile size in adult male with regard to other affecting factors, will be indispensable for both clinical and academic purposes.",

Developmental instability is measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry or phenodeviance. A negative relationship between developmental instability and fitness has figured as a prominent untested assumption in the literature. A review of available information from the literature on the relationship between developmental instability and various fitness components such as growth, fecundity, and longevity suggests that there indeed is a general negative relationship. Symmetrical individuals do generally have faster growth, higher fecundity, and better survival than do more asymmetrical individuals. These differences appear partially to arise from lower competitive ability and higher risks of predation and parasitism of asymmetrical individuals compared with more symmetrical conspecifics. The relationship between developmental stability and fitness may be either direct or indirect.",

Physically mature 12-year-old girls may have to cope with confusing sexual feelings and experiences for which they privately feel emotionally unready, despite their apparent outward sophistication. Small 14-year-old boys who are late developers suffer agonies wondering if their bodies will ever change into those of men. The sense of being unable to control the body's physical destiny can bring enormous anxiety, frustration, anger, and distress, as acne takes a hold or breasts become too obvious a feature on a shy girl's body.

It can occur in families, extended families, in neighbour hoods, schools, churches, and community groups. Both men and women can be abusive and it can occur in virtually all age groups.

Encarado el síndrome desde alguna de sus diferentes partes constitutivas (Etiopatogenia, sintomatología o formas clínicas) la dificultad se atenúa, pero el objetivo se diluye. Armonizando estos diferentes factores, podemos decir que la obesidad es una perturbación del metabolismo, caracterizado por la tendencia anormal a la acumulación de la grasa en todo o parte del cuerpo y que trae por consecuencia una disminución de la capacidad funcional del organismo. Esta acumulación exagerada de la grasa rompe si la relación entre peso y estatura; pero hasta que límite se puede llevar esta relación sin que el individuo pueda ser catalogado de obeso?. La gordura es el síntoma más ostensible del síndrome, pero ya veremos bajo que condiciones. No basta aplicar la fórmula de Broca o de Von Noordon o la de Bornhardt, para hacer un diagnóstico de obesidad.

      "abstract": "Every person goes through periods of low self-esteem at some stage in life, it’s unavoidable. Replacing this negative conditioning with more positive programming is critical to building a successful and harmonious life. Stress is perhaps the most common issue of man’s everyday life. Stress is so universal and widespread that it is considered as a hallmark of human life. Married women especially with responsibilities of job, children and ageing parents can particularly feel overwhelmed by stress of daily life and that might accentuate if women have lower esteem. Low self-esteem can lead to psychological effects that cause a person to be more susceptible to stressful situations. Conversely, high self-esteem can act as a sort of protection against high levels of stress. Individuals with low esteem tend to feel helpless, powerless, and incapable of overcoming the obstacles placed in front of them. People today suffer from stress in a range of situations. Stress is present in people’s lives and is believed to be the cause of psychopathologies, diseases, and inability to adapt to any given environment or work. Stress is considered a complex defensive-balancing mechanism of the body that develops in two stages: during the first stage, individuals assess the stressor and the demands stemming from it, and during the second stage, they evaluate whether or not they have enough resources to meet the stressor demands. The latter stage draws attention to the individual’s subjective assessment of the stressor, which conditions their reaction to it. Different people may react differently to the same stressor. The stress response refers to body reactions, which can either be physiological, emotional, or behavioral reactions to stimuli that cause stress.

For many young people, substance use reflects a cascading effect whereby earlier difficulties contribute to substance use onset and escalation, which then cascades into other difficulties. In contrast, this cascading flow can get interrupted, resulting in ontogenetic discontinuity whereby substance use and other risky behaviors during adolescence are more the result of developmentally proximal individual and contextual characteristics than distal ones. This discontinuity can reflect either a temporary developmental disturbance or a turning point, a permanent change in course. Substance use is intertwined with the many developmental changes of adolescence, providing some developmentally functional experiences while posing serious risks to health and well-being that can reverberate into adulthood.",

      "title": "This is or is not food: framing malnutrition, obesity and healthy eating",
      "abstract": "A lot of ethical research on food and agriculture focuses on distribution, responsibilities, access and impacts that harm others. However not much reflective analysis is done with respect to ontological assumptions of food and food production which are world disclosing views. They are not only perceptions, but ways people act upon an event that is seen as food, built networks of food, solve problems and connect food with other events. Cases of framing comprise malnutrition, obesity and healthy eating. Strategies of supplementation and biofortification frame ‘malnutrition as a health problem’, and propose health strategies with drugs or crops with added on drugs or vitamins. Their solutions underestimate the agricultural complexity of malnutrition and deliver only temporary relief. Framing the problem as a agricultural problem would imply taking into account the reduction of micronutrients during the post-harvest phase. Secondly, ethics of obesity assumes the ‘definition of obesity as the unbalance between energy input (food) and energy output’. This seemingly neutral definition is framed because many put emphasis on the first term, the input, and require people to eat sober and in particular to restrain oneself in the things one likes to eat. One should measure the things one is eating, weigh oneself every day and eat alone, not to be distracted by social gatherings. However, framing food as a pleasurable and social event, direct solutions of obesity to eating only the food one likes together with others. Finally, ‘nutrigenomical healthy eating assumes that one shouldn’t put trust in one’s own body’, but in biomarkers. Their quantitative outcomes are presented as moralizing directions what to eat. Healthy eating differently framed as a strategy of learning to trust one’s body, and to understand the signals that it gives together with the collective responsibilities for a meal, is outframed by this assumption. These cases will serve as a basis for generalizations on the functions of ontological, world disclosing assumptions and their ethical analysis. Food is the famous elephant in the room and has all characteristics of a multi-complex wicked problem with multi-meaning frames. Frame analysis should therefore in explicating frames strive for a transparent cooperative deliberation between them.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality and infertilityInfertility may interact with a couple's or individual's sexuality and sexual expression in two main ways.Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility) or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness.Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. Responses to infertilityIn response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may affect sexual activity.The stress of infertility and its treatment may also cause sexual difficulties for both men and women.Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem.Post-coital tests or repeated need to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, which can adversely affect his erectile or ejaculatory ability.For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begin a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures.Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress.Some people feel that their partner wants them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control.Such stresses conspire to alienate couples from the recreational aspects of sexual expression and focus them, often obsessively, on the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse.",

Si le recours à l'intellectualisation est peut être moins prévalent que chez la fille, l'activité musculaire du garçon revêt un aspect spécifique. L'histoire familiale révèle le lien particulièrement fort de l'adolescent à la mère et la dévalorisation de l'image paternelle. L'association à la prise de toxiques et la survenue de moments dépressifs sont à souligner.

      "title": "Vermoeidheid: Een onderschat probleem dat met het ouder worden erger wordt?Een kwantitatieve studie naar het verschil van intensiteit van vermoeidheid in verschillende leeftijdsfasen bij mensen met RA",
      "abstract": "Background information: Fatigue is often considered a symptom of sickness and differs from\r\nthe all known tiredness. Exhaustion, lack of energy and tiredness are often associated with\r\nfatigue. The difference is that these symptoms are able to show up even without the\r\noccurrence of a tiring exercise, and will not reduce in intensity even after a period of rest. This\r\nfatigue constrains people in their everyday lives. Every person’s life can be split into different\r\nage phases. Each of these phases contain tasks such as working, taking care of their children\r\nand maintaining the household. Fatigue can influence the life during any of those phases and\r\ntasks.\r\nResearch has shown that several factors, besides age, appear to contribute in the\r\ndevelopment of fatigue. A couple of these symptoms are pain, physical functioning,\r\ndepression, disease activity and sex. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether the\r\nintensity of fatigue differs between different age groups, and if the other factors (pain,\r\nphysical functioning, depression and disease activity) are associated to the intensity of fatigue\r\nbetween the different stages in life.\r\nMethod: In order to conduct this study, the research data of 412 RA patients (263 female, 149\r\nmale) of the DREAM remission induction cohort was used. The participants filled out the SF-\r\n36 as well as the DAS28. The SF-36 measured the relevant factors for this study; fatigue,\r\npain, depression and physical functioning. The disease activity was measured by the DAS28.\r\nThe participants are divided in the following four age categories; 18-40 year (early\r\nadulthood), 41-60 year (middle adulthood), 61-70 year (early late- adulthood) and >70 year\r\n(late late- adulthood) old. In order to analyse the obtained and categorized data, a One-way\r\nANOVA and a covariance analysis were applied.\r\nResults: There was no significant difference found in the intensity of fatigue between the four\r\ndifferent age groups. There was however a difference when comparing the group of 61-70\r\nyear with the other three groups combined. This group proved to be less fatigued than the\r\nothers. The results have shown that physical functioning, depression, gender, pain and disease\r\nactivity, are not associated with the intensity of fatigue in the different age categories.\r\nConclusion: In conclusion, the four different age groups do not differ in the fatigue that they\r\nexperience. It must be noted however that the age group of 61-70 year olds reported less\r\nfatigue than the other age groups combined. This could be because people in that age group\r\nare retiring and have less tasks to perform. None of the investigated factors are in association\r\nto the experienced fatigue in different age groups.",

Similarly, there is growing information on the thickness variation in compact bone of some modern groups, where again age, sex and race, as well as diet, are clearly important factors. Dietary specialization may result in shortages of vital food constituents as exemplified by vitamin deficiencies, but brief mention might also be made of a condition resulting directly from the over-consumption of one particular foodstuff. The more direct relationships between diet and disease have already been mentioned, but cultivation and stock rearing resulted in other human health problems. The relationship between dietary change, following the neolithic revolution, and human microevolution is both a new and dangerous field. In populations which expanded too much and too fast there is the possibility that some groups may have started to become \"famine adapted\" for smaller body size and smaller calorie needs.",

      "title": "Anti-Aging Medicine: Hype, Hope, and Reality",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS The science at the root of the questions. The term anti-aging is an oxymoron because, in time, everything in the universe ages or changes. The loss of fidelity in biological molecules is inevitable. The only biological property that is long-lasting on an evolutionary time scale is the information that is transmitted by the genome, but even that is subject to mutation or change. In addition to the physical problem of intervening in an inevitable process, there are the ethical and practical problems that would occur if it were to become possible to arrest, prevent, or reverse the aging process in humans. The notion that aging requires treatment is based on the belief that becoming old is undesirable. Aging is a negative term because it connotes deterioration, approaching pathology, and death. The hundreds of thousands of septuagenarians who follow the sun in their RVs, no longer have child-rearing responsibilities, have good health, and a modest income will disagree. To them, and others who believe that their intellectual growth does not stop, arresting adult development at an earlier age would be unthinkable. It is most likely not the fear of aging but the fear of approaching death that motivates the anti-ageists. The term prolongevist, first coined to describe a proponent of the significant extension of the length of life by human has precedence over the illogical term anti-aging and has a long history that has been well described in the monumental work by Gruman (1966). While prolongevists differ as to whether intervention in the aging process means stopping, slowing, or reversing it, all assume that intervening is not only possible but also beneficial. However, neither successful intervention nor a beneficial outcome is likely The notion of stopping or reversing the process defies fundamental laws of physics and chemistry, and slowing the process would be rife with unintended negative consequences. If advocates of intervention were to define aging properly and distinguish it from disease and the process of longevity determination, then the folly of intervention should become apparent (Hayflick,1996). Biological aging is a loss of molecular fidelity- an increase in molecular disorder throughout the body caused by random events -that occurs after reproductive maturation in animals that reach a fixed size in adulthood. Biological aging is an expression of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, or increasing entropy, or disorder, in a system. Aging is not a disease, so the concept of seeking a cure for it is tantamount to seeking a cure for embryogenesis or child or adult development. WHY AGING IS NOT A DISEASE There are thousands of manifestations of the aging process that few would consider to be pathologies or diseases in need of a cure. Emergency room personnel would not look kindly on patients who sought admission because of complaints that their hair is turning gray, that they have wrinkled skin, that their reaction time has increased, or they have experienced shortterm memory loss. Similarly, the 25-year-old Olympic champion sprinter who arrived at the ER to say that she could no longer reach the running speed that, at age 19, had won her the gold would not be treated for this complaint. These examples are all representative of the hundreds of thousands of systemic losses in molecular fidelity that lead to age changes and that are not pathologies. But, when molecular disorder occurs in cells, or cell products, that are part of vital systems and accumulate sufficiently to increase vulnerability to pathology, a trip to the emergency room may, indeed, become a necessity. The inexorable loss in molecular fidelity that defines aging can either lead to changes that may be an affront to vanity, or inconvenient, or simply uncomfortable. When the same kind of molecular mischief occurs in the cells of vital organs and then leads to an increase in vulnerability to disease or pathology, treatment is required because the person's life may become threatened. …",

Up to the age of one year, the infant tended to follow the same pattern of growth as his mother during her infancy. There was no consistent correlation between the growth of the infant and that of his father during infancy. These findings show that there is no major genetic influence on weight during infancy, but it suggests that, in some manner, the mother repeats her own pattern of upbringing when rearing her child. This effect is not due to the time that non‐breast milks or solid foods are introduced.",

Peran tersebut mencakup tiga hal, yaitu norma atau aturan, konsep dan perilaku individu. Setiap wanita belum mendapatkan status sebagai atlet atau olahragawan sejak mereka dilahirkan. Status peserta olahraga hanya diperoleh melalui tindakan yang ditunjukkan oleh tindakan mereka dalam kegiatan olahraga. Melalui olahraga wanita dapat membentuk karakter. Sejauh ini, perempuan hanyalah objek pelengkap dalam bidang olahraga, misalnya dalam beberapa kasus olahraga profesional terbatas pada pemandu sorak pelengkap atau sebagai media untuk promosi peralatan olahraga. Sehingga statusnya bukan sebagai pemain utama di bidang olahraga. Selama ini di dunia olahraga hanya memprioritaskan seseorang untuk menjadi pemenang atau juara tanpa melihat proses seseorang dalam tujuan olahraga. Atlet wanita kurang mendapat perhatian dibandingkan atlet pria. Perbedaan kesempatan ini membuat atlet wanita memiliki peluang lebih sedikit daripada pria, terutama di daerah terpencil atau di pedesaan. Perempuan ketika diberi kesempatan yang sama atau sama dengan laki-laki dalam peluang dan peluang akan jauh lebih sukses karena perempuan juga memiliki potensi yang sama dengan laki-laki. Melalui olahraga akan dapat membentuk karakter karena dalam olahraga ada nilai-nilai kerja keras, disiplin, tanggung jawab dan kejujuran. Dalam dunia olahraga, sportivitas diperlukan karena harus ada menang dan kalah di setiap kejuaraan. Seseorang yang ingin berhasil memenangkan kejuaraan perlu mendisiplinkan dirinya sendiri dalam proses pelatihan. Kejujuran dan komitmen untuk bekerja keras untuk mencapai tujuan yang ingin dicapai. Metode penelitian adalah deskriptif kualitatif dengan menggunakan observasi, wawancara dan literasi. Kesimpulan dalam penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa wanita juga berperan dalam pembentukan karakter yaitu karakter religius, kejujuran, kedisiplinan, kerjakeras, komunikatif, bertanggungjawab dan menghargai prestasi.",

      "abstract": "It is as true for non-human primates as for man and other mammalian species that the conditions surrounding intrauterine development are very important factors in determining the quality, and to some extent also the quantity, of the products of reproduction. The only other factors imposing as great limitations on the number and health of the offspring are genetic background and the reproductive physiology of the maternal animal. There are four different manifestations of abnormal intrauterine development, namely: 1) death of the conceptus, followed by resorption or abortion, 2) structural abnormality or malformation, 3) functional deficiency, including behavioural abnormality, and 4) growth retardation. The first two, death and structural abnormality, have been studied to a moderate degree in non-human primates; but deviations in function and growth that are of developmental origin have been infrequently recognized and even less often investigated.",

      "abstract": "An evolutionary perspective helps evaluate the extent to which exercise is medicine and to explain the exercise paradox: why people tend to avoid exercise despite its benefits. Many lines of evidence indicate that humans evolved to be adapted for regular, moderate amounts of endurance physical activity into late age. However, because energy from food was limited, humans also were selected to avoid unnecessary exertion, and most anatomical and physiological systems evolved to require stimuli from physical activity to adjust capacity to demand. Consequently, selection never operated to cope with the long-term effects of chronic inactivity. However, because all adaptations involve trade-offs, there is no evolutionary-determined dose or type of physical activity that will optimize health. Furthermore, because humans evolved to be active for play or necessity, efforts to promote exercise will require altering environments in ways that nudge or even compel people to be active and to make exercise fun.",

Disabled people have and continue to experience extreme rates of harm in society, in every country around the world.

Evidence from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and other cohorts is reviewed on the predictors and outcomes of subjective age. An older subjective age is predicted by age discrimination, negative changes in one’s social and family networks, lower well-being and perceived control, poor physical conditions and more chronic health problems. Subjective age is also predictive of a range of crucial outcomes. Indeed, feeling younger is related to better physical and mental health, cognition, more favorable personality changes, lower risk of incident hospitalization, and longevity. These findings suggest that the subjective experience of age is a biopsychosocial marker of aging with promise as a predictor of crucial age-related outcomes, beyond chronological age.",

The type of breeding plan to be used and the improvement possible from selection on a phenotypic basis are determined by the degree of heritability of the character involved.

The influence of environment on the expression of a complex physiological character such as growth no doubt varies with age. Since heritability is that proportion of total variance due to additive genetic variance, a change in the environmental influence, which is included in total variance, would result in a change in heritability. In the case of body weight, it is not certain that inheritance up to 8 or 12 weeks of age is the same as that responsible for later body weight or ultimate body weight. Schnetzler (1936) found…",

      "title": "On the Preservation of Health",
      "abstract": "HEALTH IS INTRINSICALLY UNSTABLE AND IS SUBJECT to erosive forces across the life trajectory, from intrauterine life to old age. As a result, few individuals achieve idealized versions of the lifespan (ie, good health and functional status into very advanced years, with compression of morbidity toward the end of life). Each person may be thought of as having, at birth, a certain quantum of health expectancy, determined by the characteristics of the individual genome and the biological quality of the intrauterine environment in which the fetus has developed. The quantum is affected over time as the biological, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics of the individual interact with environmental, socioeconomic, and educational factors, and with the amount and quality of the health care received over the life course. Programs aimed at reduction of risk through health promotion at the individual or population level have been effective to some degree, but such efforts are frequently post hoc in nature, addressing secondary or tertiary prevention needs. In addition, these efforts are disarticulated across the lifespan, with childhood and adolescent clinical and public health interventions discontinuous from those in the adult years. Furthermore, the latter often focus on behavioral and environmental health risks only after they have been unaddressed for long periods, with incipient, clinically silent disease already established. In fact, risk exposures tend to increase in number, chronicity, and cumulative importance over the life trajectory, resulting in gradual erosion of health status and of future health prospects. A more consistent effort organized around health preservation as a framing paradigm, instituted early in life, and addressed to mitigating risk factors through a more syncytial and coherent life course approach is suggested by a number of factors. First, health risks are present throughout the life course and vary in nature over time, from intrauterine life to old age. Second, many clinical disorders that manifest in adult life represent late stages of long-standing occult disease, suggesting that earlier, even lifelong, application of preventive or moderating efforts might be more effective. Third, increasing evidence suggests that important causes of morbidity in adult life have their origins very early and, in some instances, may be to a significant degree determined before birth or neonatally. Fourth, healthrelated behaviors are acquired in more or less staccato fashion over the lifespan, and once-acquired, health-adverse behaviors are often difficult to disestablish, such as eating and physical activity patterns acquired in childhood, initiation of tobacco use, or exposure to illicit drugs in adolescence. Despite an increase in life expectancy at birth of approximately 30 years during the past century in the United States, most individuals are subject to gradual impairment of health. These impairments often become overt in the middle years of life; chronic diseases are the most common proximate causes. With advancing age, the occurrence and continuation of chronic disease is common; 80% of communitydwelling US individuals older than 65 years have at least 1 identified chronic disease and 48% have 3 or more chronic diseases. The disorders that represent the chief causes of death largely reflect longstanding risk factors and many are characterized by long clinical latency and progress silently often for years before becoming clinically apparent. To a considerable extent, these disorders reflect the effect of healthadverse personal behaviors that are responsible for an estimated 40% of deaths in the United States. The health effects of many of the major risk factors are avoidable or reversible to substantial degrees. Realization of the targets established in the most recent Healthy People 2010 report is estimated to potentially increase healthy life expectancy by 5.8 to 8.1 years. Studies among the Seventh Day Adventist population have suggested that optimal healthrelated personal behaviors could add 10 years to average life expectancy. Other studies indicate sharp reductions in health risk with cessation of smoking and with the adoption of regular exercise patterns, even in old age. Appropriate clinical interventions in disease management have also been associated with improved health outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, depression, low birth weight, cataracts, and breast cancer. Mitigation of social and economic factors that adversely impact health presents a more complex set of issues. Many of these factors are related to public policy, such as the availability of adequate housing, the nature and comprehensiveness of health insurance programs, remediation of toxic environments, and efforts to reduce poverty and thereby its health impacts.",

      "title": "The adolescent and contraception.",
      "abstract": "Coital activity is often initiated during adolescence, and adolescents, like many adults, do not behave in purely rational ways and frequently fail to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Public attention is focused on adolescent pregnancies because of their increasing number and because the consequences are usually catastrophic. Unplanned pregnancies can have physical, psychosocial, and prenatal effects. It is important from both the individual and societal perspective that high priority be given to the task of preventing adolescent pregnancy. The health care provider, to gain the trust of the adolescent, must be open, honest, and willing to consider the young person's feelings and motivations. In addition to historical data and physical examination, the choice of a contraceptive method is based on individual preferences involving personal, familial, religious, and societal beliefs as well as sexual practice. A decision involving birth control for the adolescent can be complicated by parental influence and involvement. The teenage years are frequently a time of embarrassment about the physical maturation and biological functioning of the body. Birth control methods which require a person to touch himself/herself or to be used at the time of sexual intercourse may be unacceptable to the teenager. Fertility awareness techniques, such as basal body temperature, rhythm, and cervical mucus methods are inexpensive but call for a high degree of personal motivation. The use of a diaphragm requires an office visit and a pelvic examination for fitting and prescription. Contraceptive foam, suppositories, and condoms can be easily obtained over-the-counter for a minimal cost, and a moderate degree of personal motivation is needed for their effective use. Though effective, abortions should not be recommended indiscriminately. Permanent contraceptive methods are not recommended for the adolescent. The IUD and oral contraceptives (OCs) are recommended for adolescents who are unwilling to touch themselves or who desire a birth control method which can be used apart from the act of sexual intercourse. Both are highly effective, but there are important factors to consider in their prescription. Both methods require an initial office visit and pelvic examination and an additional procedure for the insertion of the IUD. Follow-up visits are essential and a prescription is necessary for the OCs. Cost can be prohibitive for the adolescent. Both have possible side effects contributing to mild to major discomfort.",

The effects of the curse will be realized when there is a pregnancy loss from among the party that was cursed. The ancestor spirits choose one form of punishment, for example, to withhold an individual's fertility or cause pregnancy loss for a specific pregnant woman. It is considered wrong for anybody to pick a quarrel with a pregnant woman, because anxiety, a disturbed mind or frustration may destabilize the fetus and cause a miscarriage or stillbirth.",

It is part of a normal psychological evolution that pushes the young to confront limits, prohibitions, other peers, and even more to confront himself.

Yet neuroscientific studies are unanimous in showing the negative effects of binge drinking on a maturing brain, with significant neurocognitive and even neuroanatomical alterations.

This article aims to show the difficult articulation between a clinical practice open to young people and a necessary concern about their behaviour, the danger of which they usually do not know.Le «binge drinking» est devenu une pratique courante chez les adolescents, donc un comportement banal en soirée. Il s’inscrit dans une évolution psychologique normale qui pousse le jeune à se confronter aux limites, aux interdits, aux autres pairs, et plus encore à soi-même. La dimension festive renforce, encore, cet attrait pour la transgression en groupe.

However, there are plenty of ethical issues with this research and it is only ethical if we can live longer both physically and mentally and not aim for amortality or immortality.

Alcoholics also attributed less control to themselves than to others, whereas nonalcoholics attributed more control to themselves than to others. These differences prevailed despite the similar socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, recent life experiences and beliefs concerning the general controllability of events of both alcoholics and nonalcoholics. The attributions of alcoholics were consistent with others' notions of self-handicapping. The attributions of nonalcoholics were consistent with control motivation. Alcoholics who attributed less control to themselves than to others more frequently failed to complete treatment than did alcoholics who attributed more control to themselves.",

      "title": "Principles of Toxicology: A Clinical Review",
      "abstract": "Toxicology can be defined as that branch of science that deals with poisons, and a poison can be defined as any substance that causes a harmful effect when administered, either by accident or design, to a living organism. In short, it is the study of toxic kinetics and toxic dynamic. Poison is a quantitative concept, almost any substance being harmful at some doses but, at the same time, being without harmful effect at some lower dose. Between these two limits there is a range of possible effects, from subtle long-term chronic toxicity to immediate lethality. Vinyl chloride may be taken as an example. It is a potent hepatotoxic at high doses, a carcinogen with a long latent period at lower doses, and apparently without effect at very low doses. The measurement of toxicity is also complex. Toxicity may be acute or chronic, and may vary from one organ to another as well as with age, genetics, gender, diet, physiological condition, or the health status of the organism. Exposure of humans and other organisms to toxicants may result from many activities: intentional ingestion, occupational exposure, environmental exposure, as well as accidental and intentional (suicidal or homicidal) poisoning. The toxicity of a particular compound may vary with the portal of entry into the body, whether through the alimentary canal, the lungs, or the skin. The initial approach to a person who has been poisoned should be to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation, and to take a thorough history. Less than 1 per cent of poisonings are fatal; therefore, management in most cases is supportive unless a specific antidote is available. Treatment for poisoning depends on the type of exposure (e.g., ingestion, inhalation), the specific toxin (poisonous substance), and the severity of the person's condition. Childhood poisoning that involves a foreign object (e.g., small toy, battery) may require surgery to remove the object. This review article gives you an overall view on toxicity, its principles, management and treatment.",

However, researchers interested in body weight and sexuality have focused exclusively on sexual disorders found in individuals with eating disorders; consequently, little is known about people's beliefs about weight and sexuality, despite the individual and interpersonal significance of such beliefs. Undergraduates received information about a male or female, obese or normal‐weight stimulus person and then evaluated that person along several dimensions related to sexuality. Participants believed that an obese man's sexual experiences would be highly similar to those of a normal‐weight man. However, participants viewed an obese woman as less sexually attractive, skilled, warm, and responsive, and perceived her as less likely to experience desire and various sexual behaviors than a normal‐weight woman. In addition, participants believed that an obese woman was less sexually attractive, skilled, warm, and responsive than an obese man.",

      "title": "A comprehensive treatment service must include developmental, systemic and collaborative components",
      "abstract": "In the absence of a strong evidence base for treatment of eating disorders, it is inevitable that there will be disagreement about what is the most appropriate treatment service. Much of K. Halmi's overview of what constitutes such a service is helpful and uncontroversial. In this commentary, I will focus on what I believe to have been neglected, insufficiently acknowledged or out of keeping with contemporary views or practice. The first omission is that of a developmental focus. The peak age of onset of eating disorders is between 14 and 18, a time of considerable physical and psychological maturation. Increasingly pre-pubertal children are developing these disorders. The potential for physical decompensation is far greater in childhood and adolescence than in adults. Particular attention needs to be paid to bone growth, both linear and density, and to reproductive organ status, all of which are threatened by inadequate nutrition. Body mass index (BMI) per se is unhelpful, as it needs to be monitored according to age, using BMI centiles for age 1. Stipulating a specific BMI for under 18s, upon which decisions are made, is misleading. From a psychological perspective, developmental issues pay a vital part in the pathogenesis and maintenance of eating disorders and subsequently need to be central to assessment and treatment. Linked to this is the importance of a systemic perspective. Children and adolescents live with their families, attend school and are intensely involved with their peer group. The family history is far less important than parental management of the illness and the parents should always be included in both the treatment planning and its delivery. Indeed, family-based approaches to treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa have a good evidence base and are central to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for its management 2. The multi-disciplinary team is, as Halmi suggests, an essential part of any treatment programme. However, Halmi makes no mention of nurses, who are central to the treatment on in-patient units and are often involved in day-care, out-patient clinics and home-based treatments. Her description of the ward milieu and physical structure of an inpatient unit emphasises “compliance”, with monitoring, controlling and restricting patient activities. Patient autonomy, privacy, comfort or rights receive virtually no attention. And there is no mention of some essential components of treatment, be that on an in- or out-patient basis: a) building a therapeutic alliance; b) skilled communication; c) empathic exploration of the patient's anxieties, concerns and cognitions; d) enhancing motivation — the unmotivated patient is far more likely to drop out of treatment 3. Halmi suggests that a cognitive behavioural approach within an in-patient unit is best. However, while there is good evidence for the value of cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia nervosa, there is no evidence that it is of any value for patients with anorexia nervosa who are of low weight, i.e. the vast majority of patients admitted to hospital with an eating disorder. Turning to medical management, I disagree with Halmi's suggestion that in-patients should be weighed daily. Such an excessive pre-occupation with weight mirrors that of our patients and simply reinforces it 1. In any event, weight is not a valid indicator of physical well-being, for numerous reasons: a) weight varies by as much as 1.5 kg within any 24 hour period; b) the process of weighing is totally unreliable, given the fallibility of scales; c) weight can be easily falsified and many patients will do so to escape from a coercive treatment regimen; in contrast, some children and adolescents will avoid weight gain to ensure they are not discharged home to an abusive environment; d) what constitutes a satisfactory BMI for one person may be too high or too low for others, given the enormous variation in healthy BMI across the population. Weight/BMI should be but one measure of physical well-being and its unreliability acknowledged and allowed for. Weight might be measured on a regular basis, but it should never be the sole determinant of management decisions, and most certainly daily weighing should be avoided. If there is considerable anxiety about a patient's physical state, then vital signs and electrolyte status will provide far more valid and useful information. Halmi makes no reference to the exciting advances in our understanding of the neuroscience of eating disorders and their clinical applicability 4–6. A primary neurobiological basis for eating disorders is almost certain, given the neurotransmitter disturbances 7,8, the consistent and persisting abnormalities in very specific domains of neuropsychological functioning 9–13, and the specific, localized and persisting abnormalities on neuroimaging 5,14,15. The clinical implications are profound, pointing to the need for treatments targeted at the underlying neurobiological substrate. The use of cognitive remediation therapy is producing some impressive results, even in those with very long-standing illness, with symptomatic improvement in both symptoms and cognitive deficits 11,16. Finally, Halmi makes no mention of the importance of including high dependency and secure facilities for those whose eating disorders require far more intensive nursing than usual or whose behaviour is life threatening. The availability of step-down facilities, from secure/high dependency units, via specialized inpatient units and day care, to out-patient clinics and domiciliary care would make for a far more comprehensive service. A truly comprehensive service would need to have a full range of specialists, including nurses and therapists trained in motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive remediation therapy. The service would need to be clearly subdivided into two sections, one for children and adolescents, with an emphasis on developmental and systemic issues, and the other for adults. The ethos of this comprehensive service needs to be grounded, not in compliance, coercion and monitoring, but in the therapeutic alliance.",

      "abstract": "This chapter looks at how underlying social processes of status inequality, anxiety, and shame shape infant feeding orientation. It examines this connection by looking at the ways in which status anxiety experienced through shame makes infant feeding an emotionally intense feature of early mothering. Infant feeding is often experienced as emotionally intense, not only because of practical concerns with how one's baby might be growing and thriving, but also because of the moralised approach to promotion strategies. When breastfeeding is established as the hallmark of good mothering, the feeling that one is failing can be very damaging, whether one is not breastfeeding at all, not breastfeeding appropriately, or not breastfeeding with sufficient dedication. It should be no surprise that advertising for infant formula explicitly reassures non-breastfeeding mothers that this approach to feeding also signals devotion to infant health, bonding, and taking pride in children's development. However, this chapter argues that the shaming effects of current breastfeeding advocacy also undermine attempts to normalise the practice, as avoiding potential shame can mean avoiding breastfeeding completely.",

      "title": "DISABILITY: INDEPENDENT OR DEPENDENT VARIABLE IN GERONTOLOGICAL RESEARCH?",
      "abstract": "Abstract A critical issue for bridging aging and disability research is developing a shared understanding of when disability should be employed as an independent or a dependent variable. To date, this discussion has rarely been had across researchers. Is disability a dependent variable, an outcome? Or does it contribute to outcomes as an independent variable? Or both? How disability is conceptualized, measured, analyzed, and interpreted matters for how we understand the role disability plays over the life course. Disability status is used as both an independent and a dependent variable in gerontological and disability/rehabilitation research. Research in both fields often focuses on reducing likelihood, duration, and severity of disability. A key distinction between fields is how each conceptualize disability – what it is and what it means – particularly given age of onset and type of disability. For example, in gerontological research, often positions disability as an individual trait that mediates the ability to live independently (typically reducing independence). However, disability/rehabilitation research commonly positions disability as a situational trait, or moderating variable associated with difficulty of living independently, but not causing inability to live independently. NIH’s recent inclusion of disability as a social determinant of health provides an opportunity for gerontologists to more deeply consider how disability is employed in research designs and why. We discuss how more consistent use of disability as an independent and/or dependent variable can help bridge aging and disability research and provide greater understanding of the role disability plays over the life course.",

Whilst the potential health benefits of consuming adequate levels of certain minerals in pregnancy is well documented, i.e. iron and iodine, less is known about the potential role(s) of other minerals, such as selenium, copper and chromium. It would be useful to carry out additional studies to see if any of these understudied minerals could be of benefit to maternal/infant health.

      "abstract": "My aim in this book is to summarise recent research dealing with psychological aspects of nutrition in childhood. Broadly speaking, these psychological aspects involve two kinds of problem – those concerned with the development of behaviour that is related to food intake, and those concerned with the later consequences of malnutrition, or more generally with the later consequences of different types of nutrition. The overall organisation of the book is developmental. I deal in turn with problems that arise before or around the time of birth, with problems associated with infancy and the weaning period, and with problems which are more characteristically associated with later childhood and adolescence. These are the major transitions. Birth is a major transition because although malnutrition can arise before or after birth (and malnutrition in both periods can have effects on the child's development), its causes before and after birth are obviously different: only malnutrition after birth can result from problems with the child's own feeding behaviour, for example. Weaning is a major transition between two quite different kinds of feeding behaviour. Adolescence and the period preceding it involve transitions of a different kind, characterised by changes in the meaning and significance of food and body weight rather than in the nature of eating behaviour and the foods that are eaten. But although the overall organisation of the book is developmental, some departure from this order is necessary, and there cannot, of course, be any strict demarcations between the different stages of life.",

      "abstract": "Critical or sensitive periods in the life of an organism during which certain experiences or conditions may exert disproportionate influence (either for harm or benefit) on long-term developmental outcomes have been the subject of investigation for over a century. This chapter reviews research in the context of the development of social preferences and sensory systems, with a summary of the criteria for defining such a period and the evidence necessary to establish its existence. The notion of nutritional programming, central to the Barker/Developmental Origins hypotheses of health and disease, represents a variant of the critical/sensitive period concept. It is implicit in these hypotheses that the fetal period is a time during which metabolic and physiological systems are malleable and thus susceptible to either insult or enhancement by nutrient intake. Evidence for critical/sensitive periods or nutritional programming requires a systematic manipulation of the age at which nutritional conditions or supplements are implemented. While common in research using animal models, the approach is difficult to establish in epidemiological studies and virtually nonexistent in human clinical trials. Future work seeking to establish definitive evidence for critical/sensitive periods or programming may be advanced by harmonized outcome measures in experimental trials across which the timing, duration, and dose of nutrients is varied.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For men in general, there are a variety of reasons for impaired sexual performance, including depression, anxiety, and medications. For men with PD, additional factors may play a role. Let’s think about this in more detail. Impotence implies difficulty with sexual performance—problems achieving and maintaining an erection, which should lead to ejaculation. Before considering all the things that can disrupt sexual performance, we should recognize that occasional impotence is common. This is something that can and does happen to even the most macho guy. Men are at their sexual peak during their teenage years and a little after. With passing decades, not only does the urge for sexual gratification decline but also the ability to perform. Hence, as men pass beyond the years when all they think about is sex, occasional impotence is fairly common. We need to accept this, just as we are stuck with the joint pains that never bothered us when we were young, or the middle-age requirement for reading glasses.",

      "title": "Environmental effects on reproductive health: the endocrine disruption hypothesis.",
      "abstract": "R eproductive health is exquisitely sensitive to characteristics of an individual's environment-including physical, biological, behavioral, cultural and socioeconomic factors. The relative effects of these features may vary in different parts of the world or even within a country. For example, in populations with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases or in areas with inadequate health care resources, untreated infections may pose the greatest threats, increasing women's risk of experiencing premature delivery, fetal loss or prenatal mortality. Furthermore, the infants of women with such diseases risk acquiring the infection during delivery and are vulnerable to other complications during the neonatal period.' In societies where cultural norms favor large families, women may suffer health problems resulting from frequent childbearing. Similarly, malnutrition increases a pregnant woman's susceptibility to poor outcomes. In some regions, workplace and industrial pollution, as well as substances that are used commercially or in the home, may pose the greatest threats. Exposure to lead, for instance, is associated with fertility impairments in both women and men, as well as with the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth; exposure to mercury in certain forms may cause birth defects and neurological disorders. A rnumber of solvents contribute to the risk of spontaneous abortion and birth defects, and some of these substances may be a factor in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and male infertility. Epidemiological studies have proven the adverse reproductive health effects of some pesticides, and mounting evidence suggests that other of these products also are harmful to reproductive health.2 Both man-made and naturally occurring materials that appear to interfere with hormone synthesis or action are among substances whose effects on reproductive health are strongly suggested, if not clearly established. Recent research pointing to the possible role of so-called endocrine disrupters in a variety of reproductive health problems in wildlife, laboratory animals and humans has engendered considerable controversy in scientific circles. Some scientists question the valhdity of the findings on a variety of grounds, while others have used them to outline agendas for further research and relevant policymaking. As the endocrine disruption debate continues to occupy researchers, it also is gaining attention among the public. During the past several years, articles and opinion pieces about reproductive health problems and endocrine disruption have appeared in newspapers and in popular science, business, news and general interest magazines.3 Public interest groups have produced monographs reviewing the subject,4 and the trade publications of industries whose products have been labeled endocrine disrupters have carried articles and editorials seeking a balanced reading of the evidence.5 A new round of coverage followed the publication in early 1996 of Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival?-A Scientific Detective Story.6 The book, written for lay readers, chronicles the development of the endocrine disruption hypothesis and considers its implications. Much of the popular coverage of the issue has reflected great attention to presenting both sides of the question in a manner that will inform but not alarm the public. Some of it, however, has been less successful at establishing a context for the findings, clearly distinguishing facts from hypotheses, and communicating a measured view of the implications both of what has been demonstrated and of areas requiring extensive additional research. The public has a right and a need to know about issues with a potential for substantial public health ramifications; sensible voices on both sides of this debate acknowledge the need for additional research and risk assessment, clear priorities for dealing with documented risks and dissemination of verifiable information that can help individuals make informed health decisions. The endocrine disruption hypothesis promises to remain a focus of researchand debate-for some time to come. Therefore, without minimizing the importance of other environmental risk factors for men's and women's reproductive health, this report focuses on what is known about hormone disrupters, areas that are being explored and the potential implications for public health and policy.",

Questions intended to induce either fact retrieval or inferential reasoning were shown to younger (n = 37), middle aged (n = 37) and older (n = 37) adults in both a multiple choice and true/false format. Increasing age level was not related to decreased confidence in either fact retrieval or inferential reasoning. Global assessments about these question-answering processes involving \"people in general\" and self evaluations were taken from the same individuals. In contrast to personal confidence ratings, adults of all ages generally believed in declining fact retrieval abilities in old age. Inferential reasoning, however, often was believed to remain stable or even increase in ability level with increasing age. This was especially true in the assessments generated by older adults and in self evaluations. Thus, negative global beliefs about memory and aging may be present even when such global beliefs contradict item-specific judgments and personal beliefs about one's own cognition.",

      "title": "Life-History Tactics: A Review of the Ideas",
      "abstract": "This review organizes ideas on the evolution of life histories. The key life-history traits are brood size, size of young, the age distribution of reproductive effort, the interaction of reproductive effort with adutl mortality, and the variation in these traits among an individual's progeny. The general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations of traits will evolve in organisms living in specified circumstances. First consider single traits. Theorists have made the following predictions: (1) Where adult exceeds juvenile mortality, the organism should reproduce only once in its lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality, the organism should reproduce several times. (2) Brood size should maximize the number of young surviving to maturity, summed over the lifetime of the parent. But when optimum brood-size varies unpredictably in time, smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the chances of total failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding populations, selection should minimize age at maturity. In stable populations, when reproductive success depends on size, age, or social status, or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then maturation should be delayed, as it should be in declining populations. (4) Young should increase in size at birth with increased predation risk, and decrease in size with increased resource availability. Theorists have also predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur in specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations, age at maturity should be minimized, reproductive effort concentrated early in life, and brood size increased. (6) One view holds that in stable environments, late maturity, multiple broods, a few, large young, parental care, and small reproductive efforts should be favored (K-selection). In fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small young, reduced parental care, and large reproductive efforts should be favored (r-selection). (7) But another view holds that when juvenile mortality fluctuates more than adult mortality, the traits associated with stable and fluctuating environments should be reversed. We need experiments that test the assumptions and predictions reviewed here, more comprehensive theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions, and examination of different definitions of fitness.",

      "title": "Group Diets in Late Medieval England",
      "abstract": "Abstract In late medieval England, there were two principal reasons for group diets, that is the fashioning or restriction of consumption for a common purpose. Foremost was the link between diet, religion, and virtue with the state of the body beyond the physical. The moral impact of this belief was wide; the dietary consequences were in practice restricted to that part of the population, a minority, who had regular access to meat and who could afford substitutes, often expensive, such as fish. The second principal motive for group diets—identity or social competition— was similarly restricted to those with the resources to choose their food. Two further grounds had a narrower impact. Diet was an essential component of valetudinarianism and medicine. This led to consistent patterns of consumption among some groups of the young, the old, and for some individuals and groups, male and female. There were, finally, uniform patterns that resulted from communal living or common purpose, for example, the result of the provision- ing of armies, or food in an institutional setting. In each case the group might live physically together, but one need not conceive group diets solely in this way. A pattern of diet might identify an individual as part of a wider or dispersed grouping. Equally, one might find in a group living together, such as an aristocratic household, perhaps as many as half a dozen distinct dietary regimes for different parts of the establishment.",

The key to the problem is offered by the constant pursuit of pleasure which satisfaction and psychological well-being, hedonistic concept has always sought by humans. The transition from \"normal\" to \"abnormal\" is relative to the times, more and more short, in which the subject tends to reach a positive value, such as that of being, behaving this flattening imagination to reality and removing its true value. This article will focus precisely on the new forms of behavioral addiction, or the New Addiction. Among these will be discussed also a dependence little known in Italy but very developed in America: the Vigorexia (or addiction to sports), which can lead to the assumption of doping substances. Vigorexia doping and traveling on the same track and take pathological forms because it is closely related to the need to need welfare linked to the use of substances harmful to the body and recurrence of harmful behaviors.

      "title": "Influence of menopause on sexuality.",
      "abstract": "Menopause is associated with anatomical, physiological and psychological changes that often influence sexuality in the aging female. The decreased estrogen levels have a multitude of effects on sexual function, including decreased support of female pelvis, loss of ability to adequately lubricate the urogenital tissue, and changes in body configuration. This situation is aggravated by the alterations in the skin, breasts, muscles and skeleton caused by estrogen loss. For many women, these changes translate into a poorer self-image, diminution of self-esteem and, eventually, a loss of sexual desire. Societal expectations also have a negative impact on sexuality, as most cultures still believe that older women become sexually retired. Although this attitude is changing, cross-sectional studies still show that there are negative sexuality changes associated with menopause and that postmenopausal women note a loss of sexual desire. Age and relationship status are also important correlates of sexual activity and sexual satisfaction. With increasing age, the frequency of most types of sexual activity decreases and sexual dysfunctions increase. Urogenital atrophy due to loss of estrogen is one of the most important contributors to the decline in sexual activity with the menopause. Partner availability and partner function are important contributors as well to the decline of sexual activity, since older men, like older women, often have sexual dysfunctions. Overall, decreased sexual desire and loss of vaginal lubrication in the female and erectile difficulties in the male, or absence of a partner, are commonly reported causes of increasing sexual difficulties for the older female. Hormone replacement therapy not only ameliorates the local anatomic and physiologic changes, but also may have positive psychological benefits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Las consecuencias pueden ser inmediatas o de corto, mediano y largo plazos y se dan sobre la salud física (suicidio, homicidio, muertes derivadas de sida o por complicaciones del embarazo; lesiones leves y graves, infecciones pélvicas y de transmisión sexual, embarazos ectópicos, embarazos no deseados, abortos espontáneos o inducidos, peso bajo al nacer) y mental (depresión, ansiedad, síndrome postraumático, síndrome posviolación, trastornos del sueño, obesidad, consumo de alcohol, drogas y tabaco y conductas sexuales de riesgo, entre otras) y tiene también impacto social (costos derivados de la atención de la salud y de la atención legal, implicancias sobre la productividad y el empleo).

We examine the ways in which normalcy is produced, maintained, and threatened, and discuss the implications for the applicability and relevance of these traditional sociological concepts. Analysis of children’s and young people’s accounts resulted in a conceptualization of four forms of normalcy based on personal and social definitions and audiences. Biographical disruption appeared relevant but in a more nuanced form than its usual conceptualization when applied to adult populations. Maintaining normality within the family resulted in continual biographical revision in anticipation of future illness trajectory and life course.",

      "title": "Impact of physical activity and exercise on male reproductive potential: a new assessment questionnaire",
      "abstract": "Male athletes in general are subjected to the same causes of infertility as the general population, but sports practice itself may be possibly an additional infertility factor or, at least an aggravating factor for a previously existing fertility condition; on the contrary, being physically active has been hypothesized to favor hormonal and seminological processes and could be beneficial for fertility. In this relationship, the different inherent parameters of physical activity-exercise (training volume, intensity, objective, organization and frequency) are of paramount importance. Therefore, this review discusses both the negative and positive impact of physical exercise on the male reproductive potential. Clear knowledge is lacking on this topic as incongruences exist due to the fact that studies lack standardization in assessment tools or research protocols. So that future studies can reveal more information regarding exercising male fertility, we introduce a unique questionnaire developed with the intent to help standardize future studies on male fertility and exercise. Los atletas masculinos presentan, generalmente, las mismas causas de infertilidad que la población general; no obstante, la práctica deportiva puede ser, por sí misma, un factor de infertilidad o un factor agravante en el caso de un problema previo de fertilidad; por otra parte, se ha sugerido recientemente que ser físicamente activo puede favorecer el entorno hormonal y seminológico y, por ende, ser beneficioso para la fertilidad. En esta relación, los distintos parámetros inherentes relacionados a la actividad física y al ejercicio (volumen, intensidad, objetivo, organización y frecuencia) son de suprema importancia. Esta revisión versa sobre el impacto, tanto negativo como positivo, del ejercicio físico sobre el potencial reproductivo masculino. No existe un conocimiento consensuado sobre este tópico debido a incongruencias derivadas del hecho de que los estudios carecen de estandarización en las herramientas de evaluación y/o los protocolos de investigación. Con la finalidad de que estudios futuros puedan revelar más información sobre la fertilidad en los hombres que practican ejercicio físico, presentamos un cuestionario único desarrollado con el objetivo de ayudar a estandarizar estudios futuros que versen sobre fertilidad masculina y ejercicio. Atletas do sexo masculino geralmente têm as mesmas causas de infertilidade que a população em geral; contudo, o desporto em si pode ser um fator de infertilidade ou um fator agravante no caso de problema de fertilidade anterior. Além disso, recentemente, tem sido sugerido para ser fisicamente ativo pois pode promover melhoras no ambiente seminológico e hormonal e, portanto, ser benéfico para a fertilidade. Neste sentido, os diversos parâmetros inerentes relacionados à atividade física e exercício físico (volume, intensidade, finalidade, organização e frequência) são de suma importância. Este artigo trata do impacto, tanto positivo como negativo, do exercício físico sobre o potencial reprodutivo masculino. Não há conhecimento consensual sobre este tema, por causa de inconsistências decorrentes do fato de que os estudos carecem de padronização em ferramentas de avaliação e/ou protocolos de pesquisa. A fim de que estudos futuros possam revelar mais informações sobre a fertilidade em homens que praticam exercício, apresentamos um questionário desenvolvido para ajudar a padronizar os estudos futuros que lidam com a fertilidade masculina e o exercício.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical and complex phase in human development characterized by major biological, psychological, and social changes. Puberty marks the beginning of accelerated physical growth, alterations in body composition, and sexual maturation. The growth spurt in female adolescents contributes about 16% to adult height, 54% to adult weight, 73% to adult body fat content, 40% to adult lean body mass, and about 37% to the whole body calcium (Fig. 1). Similar changes are present in males. All individuals during this period of life should be in a strong positive nitrogen balance and balance of minerals required for body building. Those changes influence teenagers' nutritional needs and status (Fig. 2). In addition, psychological changes involving the adolescent's search for independence and identity, desire for acceptance by peers, and preoccupation with physical appearance may affect eating habits, food choices, nutrient intake, and particularly status of certain minerals of which calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and selenium (Se) are the most important. During the last 20 years, the focus of nutrition research and recommendations for children has shifted from the prevention of nutritional deficiencies to the early establishment of recommended diets to prevent chronic diseases.These priorities may eventually lead to dietary guidelines for the prevention and treatment of those conditions by targeting predisposed individuals early in life (3).",

Adolescence is a time of major social, environmental, and biological change in a person’s life. The start of puberty, which often happens around the teenage years, is an important period of human physical and emotional development. In addition to the more obvious bodily changes that happen during this time, an adolescent’s brain also goes through changes that may not be as visible. These changes are directed by chemicals called hormones. Hormones help our bodies become taller, change shape, and even grow hair. Although hormones act on different parts of the body (like bones, muscles, or skin), several crucial hormones for puberty are actually made in the brain. Scientists are learning more about the ways hormones affect how the brain grows and changes, and in turn, the way that changes how you act and feel!",

      "title": "Eroticism as a hormetic stimulus in health and ageing",
      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this paper I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that, health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

      "title": "Self-Regulatory Mechanisms Governing Gender Development",
      "abstract": "This study tested predictions about development of gender-related thought and action from social cognitive theory. Children at 4 levels of gender constancy were assessed for their gender knowledge, personal gender standards, and gender-linked behavior under different situational conditions. Irrespective of gender constancy level, all children engaged in more same-sex than cross-sex typed behavior. Younger children reacted in a gender stereotypic manner to peers' gender-linked behavior but did not regulate their own behavior on the basis of personal gender standards. Older children exhibited substantial self-regulatory guidance based on personal standards. They expressed anticipatory self-approval for same-sex typed behavior and self-criticism for cross-sex typed behavior. Their anticipatory self-sanctions, in turn, predicted their actual gender-linked behavior. Neither gender knowledge nor gender constancy predicted gender-linked behavior. These results lend support to social cognitive theory that evaluation and regulation of gender-linked conduct shifts developmentally from anticipatory social sanctions to anticipatory self-sanctions rooted in personal standards.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a disorder characterized by reduced bone mass, impaired bone quality and a propensity to fracture. Traditionally, osteoporosis has been viewed as a syndrome characterized by back pain and vertebral fractures. Osteoporotic fractures have long been regarded as a female ailment, but with the increasing longevity of men, it appears that the incidence and prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in men is not very different from the rate in women although it occurs approximately 10 years later in the lives of men. Morbidity and mortality associated with fractures and their (surgical) treatment is considerably greater than in women. A multitude of factors determine bone strength: genetic, nutritional (calcium), vitamin D, physical activity, and hormonal factors. Hormonal factors are significant throughout life, from puberty onwards. In adolescence they are indispensable for the formation of peak bone mass. Throughout life, sex steroids maintain bone formation. Surprisingly, in men estrogens appear to be more significant for the development of peak bone mass and the maintenance of bone mineral density than androgens. In men estrogens are derived from androgens and levels of both of them are strongly interrelated (adequate androgen levels imply adequate estrogen levels).",

Je oznacovana jako stav, při němž clověk neni schopen sam vědomě regulovat odchod moci. Mocova inkontinence je spojena se znacnou tělesnou, psychickou, socialni a ekonomickou zatěži. U inkontinentnich pacientů dochazi casto ke ztratě sebeucty, k rozpakům, k naruseni kvality života a spolecenskeho styku. Lide se casto vzdavaji sveho běžneho životniho stylu. Dochazi tak ke zřejmemu poskozeni socialnich vazeb, partnerských vztahů, profesniho zařazeni a celkove spokojenosti. Unik moci je problem intimniho razu a ne vsichni jsme schopni a ochotni o něm otevřeně hovořit. Ve sve praci se zabývam klasifikaci, diagnostikou, lecbou inkontinence a inkontinentnimi pomůckami urcenými specialně pro muže. Pro praci byl zvolen kvantitativni výzkum. Byla použita výzkumna metoda formou dotazniku. Sběr informaci probihal ve třech ambulancich praktických lekařů v Ceských Budějovicich. Výzkumným souborem byli muži z Ceských Budějovic starsich 30ti let, kteři ve dnech 17.1.- 28.2. 2007 navstivili vybrane ambulance praktickeho lekaře v Ceských Budějovicich. Dotazniky byly podavany nahodně. Provedeným výzkumem se měla potvrdit ci vyvratit stanovena hypoteza, ktera zni: Muži nemaji informace o problematice mocove inkontinence. Výzkumem byla hypoteza potvrzena. Cil prace byl splněn. Výzkumem byla zjistěna skutecnost, že převažna cast dotazovaných respondentů by od sveho praktickeho lekaře uvitali vice informaci o problematice mocove inkontinence a že sami respondenti si mysli, že informovanost mužů o tomto problemu je nedostatecna. Dale z výzkumu vyplýva, že převažna cast respondentů nemělo nikdy k dispozici informacni material o mocove inkontinenci. V praxi bychom se měli zaměřit na zkvalitněni informovanosti, ktera by se urcitě zlepsila, kdyby se zvýsila výroba a distribuce brožur o inkontinenci a siroka veřejnost k nim měla přistup. Letaky by měli být volně k odebrani v cekarnach u praktickeho lekaře, tak i v geriatrických ambulancich. Dale by se měli zajistit edukacni programy pro klienty a prohloubit poznatky sester, aby byly schopne poskytnout důležite informace a pomoci lidem s mocovou inkontinenci.

      "abstract": "Growth and physical maturation are dynamic processes encompassing a broad spectrum of cellular and somatic changes. The most obvious signs of physical growth are changes in overall body size. The children of the same age may differ in rate of physical growth. Ethnic variations in growth rate are also common. Thus growth norms (age-related averages for height and weight) must be applied cautiously. Physical growth, like other aspects of development, results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, the endocrine glands also control the vast physical changes of childhood and adolescence. Although heredity remains important, environmental factors continue to affect genetic expression. Good nutrition, relative freedom from disease, and emotional well-being are essential to childrenâs healthy development. Changes in size, proportions, and muscle strength support an explosion of new gross-motor skills. Physical activity is needed for normal growth and development, and for young people to reach their potential in muscle and bone development. Further, the psychological, social, and physical development process project powerful influences on sport participation. Sports scientists, physicians and physical educators must be familiar with the normal patterns of growth and development of the child and adolescent. This allow finding out deviations during the pre-participation examination, guiding children into appropriate activities, aiding them in setting realistic goals concerning sports participation. It also provides guidance to the community and coaches in the design of safe and effective training programme.",

In The Circumplex Model, a model that seeks to explain family functioning patterns, family health has two dimensions, located at either end of a continuum. first dimension, adaptability, measures how well a family deals with internal change; the second dimension, cohesion, measures the family's ability to function together as a unit. two extremes of adaptability are rigidity and chaos; the two extremes of cohesion are enmeshment and disengagement. Research has shown that family environment may be a very accurate predictor of at-risk behavior. Family-related factors which affect drug use (or nonuse) and eating patterns in offspring include: family health and parenting style, parental support, independence, and parental control. A list of ways to encourage children not to use drugs or alcohol focuses on communication, development of independent thinking, self esteem, and strengthening family interaction. (IAH)",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Recent studies have suggested that black individuals have lower energy expenditure than whites. Many investigators hypothesized that this is why black women experience higher rates of obesity than white women. These findings initiated much research on race as a primary biological determinant of obesity and energy expenditure as a potential pathway. Race is a difficult construct to use in biomedical research. Recent findings Recent findings have included: an explanation for the lower resting energy expenditure observed among black adults, data showing that relative resting energy expenditure may not be a significant predictor of weight change in African-origin populations, and inconsistent data on the role of activity energy expenditure as a determinant of children's weight change. Summary The data suggest that black individuals have lower resting energy expenditure and possibly activity energy expenditure than white individuals. The lower resting energy expenditure is probably caused by a smaller mass of high metabolically active organs. It is unlikely that increased weight gain is associated with lower resting energy expenditure or activity among blacks, because no association has been found within populations. Clinically, it is important to focus on personal modifiable risk factors, e.g., energy intake and physical activity levels.",

Within a particular population final adult height is not related to the speed with which it is reached; on average, early and late developers end up almost exactly the same in height.

      "title": "The Weight I Carry: Intersections of Fatphobia, Gender, and Capitalism",
      "abstract": "The Weight I CarryIntersections of Fatphobia, Gender, and Capitalism Shawna Felkins (bio) I have been fat for most of my life. A cute, fat little girl with cute, fat not-so-little legs. But there was a point when the fat wasn't cute anymore, when it did not elicit the pinching of cheeks, but the reprimanding clucking of tongues. And thus, my child's body and I were given a label that I did not and still do not understand—obese. For many fat folks, this word has become a scourge, a plague, an indicator of a lack of morality and deservingness. B. Elbel and colleagues, in a public health study of \"obesity,\" write that \"potential short-term impacts on fitness, social and emotional development (at least partially driven by obesity-related stigma), and academic success\" were potential negative impacts related to childhood obesity.1 What this article—and numerous others in the public health field and medico-scientific literature—fail to grapple with is fat stigma or fatphobia that is present in much of Western society, especially within the United States. Children may experience the aforementioned negative impacts because of external factors, not just the sizes of their bodies, and how they learn to inhabit that body in spaces and around people that are often too small for them. As my younger brother hit puberty and shot up to 6 feet, 3 inches, his body changed and his fat seemed to disappear. Mine only grew. I watched in horror as new stretch marks spread their tendrils across my hips and breasts, my arms, and the backs of my knees. And I started to realize that with each utterance of concern my family would always hand me that tiny consolation prize, wrapped neatly with the large, distracting bow people place on backhanded compliments: but you have such a pretty face. With each utterance of this seemingly innocuous phrase I began to understand that the only part of me that could ever be pretty was my face, the rest of my body a hindrance, a failure for someone to tolerate. At sixteen, I tried NutriSystem. When I was seventeen, I started taking cans of Slimfast to school. When I was eighteen, the first signs of bulimia appeared, the result of a life full of people telling me that my body was too much. My undergraduate [End Page 180] career was tainted by the taste of vomit and the red streaks that stretched from my knuckles to my wrists. And when I confided in a friend what I was sneaking into the dorm bathrooms to do at night, she looked at me blankly and asked if I was sure I was bulimic because I hadn't really lost any weight. My fatness has always been seen as the failing of my parents, other family members, and later myself, even in their eyes. I would argue that these major themes of responsibility—on culture, mothers, and individual behaviors—stem from neoliberal capitalist ideology that seems to have permeated the field of public health. Like Kathleen LeBesco and Susan Greenhalgh, the geographer and food studies scholar Julie Guthman draws a connection between capitalism, citizenship, and \"obesity.\" Guthman argues that to be a (read: good) citizen of the United States, full participation in the capitalist economy is necessary. Therefore a balance of consumption while still staying thin is struck: We [Guthman and DuPuis] noted a culture of bulimia, where on one hand buying and eating (being good consumers) is encouraged and on the other \"deservingness\" is performed by being slim, such that the good subject buys more and weighs less. . . . We then made the claim that epidemic talk itself is a form of discipline which uses the extremes as examples to warn the 'normal.'2 While this comparison to an eating disorder is both blunt and aggressive, it is effective in describing the catch 22 for fat people in the US—you should consume a lot, but never should that consumption cause your body to grow in size. All of these scholars use the framework of \"morality\" that Abigail Saguy and Kevin Riley identify as a crucial component to the narrative that drives...",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Different scenarios for an ageing society presume different approaches to the meaning of old age. One scenario anticipates a Prolongation of Morbidity , where quality of life concerns might permit active euthanasia or suicide as a means of saving money. Those who believe in a Compression of Morbidity opt for health promotion to delay morbidity in favour of productive ageing. Optimists look to a scenario of Lifespan Extension , where scarce health resources are not expended for incremental gains in life expectancy but rather for basic research to postpone or eliminate ageing. Finally, those who emphasize Voluntary Acceptance of Limits identify the meaning of old age with voluntary acceptance of finitude, where claims of future generations might limit longevity for any one generation. Thus, contrasting meanings such as quality of life, productive ageing, indefinite survival and voluntary limits entail very different consequences for the allocation of scarce resources across age-groups and among sub-groups of the elderly population.",

      "abstract": "Behaviors that pose risks for an individual’s health and that also represent important threats for public health, such as drug use, smoking, alcohol, unhealthy eating causing obesity, and unsafe sex, are highly prevalent in low income countries, even though they are traditionally associated with richer countries. Individual choices are an important part of the risky behaviors. Risking Your Health: Causes, Consequences, and Interventions to Prevent Risky Behaviors explore how those choices are formed and what are their consequences. Why do people engage in risky behaviors? Many different explanations have been proposed by psychology, sociology, economics or public health. One trait common to all these behaviors is that there is a disconnect – a function of both delay and uncertainty - between the pleasure or satisfaction provided by them and their consequences. Another characteristic of risky behaviors is that they rarely occur in isolation. Peer-pressure, parental influences, networks and social norms often play an important role in initiating, continuing, or quitting those behaviors. Even if they might often be the first to suffer, the consequences of risky behaviors are also rarely limited to the individuals engaging in them. In certain cases, such as second-hand smoking or HIV transmission, the link is direct. In other cases, the link is less direct but not necessarily less real: the long term health consequences of many of these behaviors are costly to treat and could stretch households’ finances and worsen poverty. Finally, these risky behaviors have consequences for society as a whole since they often trigger a non-trivial amount of public health expenditures and lead to declines in aggregate productivity through premature death and morbidity. Changing behaviors is tricky -- public health interventions via legislation with strong enforcement mechanisms can be more effective than simple communication campaigns informing consumers about the risks associated with certain behaviors, since translating knowledge into concrete changes in behavior seems to be hard to achieve. Economic mechanisms such as taxes (especially on alcohol and tobacco products), subsidies (such as free condoms), and conditional/unconditional cash transfers are also used to reduce risky behaviors (for example in HIV prevention). Of great interest to policy makers, academics and practitioners, this book assesses the efficiency of those interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of behaviors that endanger health.",

Intimidation is an act of aggressive conduct, this repeats itself in order to damage deliberately another person, it can be in a physical or\nmental way. Harassment is characterized by the behavior of a person who wants to gain power on another person. School´s harassment or bullying is the physical or psychological deliberate and constant mistreatment that a child receives on the part of other one or others, which behave with him cruelly with the aim to submit it and to scare it. It implies a continued\nrepetition of the jeers or the aggressions and can provoke the social exclusion of the victim. The dominant type of violence is the emotional and occurs mainly in the classroom and playground of the school. The person who is abused stays exposed physical and emotionally to the abuser,\ngenerating as a result a number of psychological consequences.

However, individuals differ in their ability to choose delayed rewards. Selfcontrolled individuals are strongly influenced by delayed reinforcement, and choose large, delayed rewards in preference to small, immediate rewards; in contrast, individuals who are relatively insensitive to delayed reinforcement choose impulsively, preferring the immediate, smaller reward in this situation (1). Impulsivity has long been recognized as a normal human characteristic (2) and in some circumstances it may be beneficial (3), but impulsive choice contributes to deleterious states such as drug addiction (4-8) and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (9).",

Also, research has shown that microaggressions can hurt people from underrepresented groups, like people of colour and women, more than others, which can worsen workplace inequality. They can also contribute to a hostile and unwelcoming work environment that makes employees less productive, more likely to miss work, and less happy. Microaggressions can be done on purpose or by accident. Even though they are small, research has shown that they significantly impact employees' mental health, job satisfaction, and overall well-being.

By reviewing recent empirical literatures, negative emotions, body-image, perfectionism, and dieting seem to emerge as primary triggers to binge eating episode. Specially, negative emotions have been extensively discussed and believed to play a pivotal role in triggering the onset of binge eating. Body image and the trait perfectionism tend to be interrelated and mutually reinforced, increasing the risk for binge eating. Lastly, the effect of dieting seems to be relatively ambiguous, as it has been shown to be confounded by multiple factors, indicative of an indirect effect on binge eating. Although limitations were acknowledged, the findings of the present study still provided a comprehensive insight into the potential triggers to binge eating among the subgroup of people without eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "This is a brief review of the normal changes in adolescent behaviour and the interplay between biology and social factors that occur at and around puberty, in an attempt to explain when this transition may become problematic The onset of puberty is a biological marker for an individual's transition from a non-reproductive to a reproductive state. Adolescence is a normal developmental transition associated with clearly visible physical changes, reorganization and pruning of neuronal circuits in the brain and the occurrence of new behaviours and interests. It is a time when new life tasks (orientation towards peers of the other sex, romantic and sexual involvement and mastering an educational career) need to be mastered. Parent-child conflict increases and becomes more intense as the adolescent struggles for more independence while still requiring support. These normal changes can become problematic if biological and social expectations diverge e.g. entering puberty very early or very late. While early pubertal onset in boys is likely to have beneficial effects, in girls precocious pubertal timing may have a negative impact on body-image, affect (or emotional well-being) and sex-role expectations. Other individual biological predispositions and genetic endowment may interact with social factors (e.g. peers, parenting style, neighbourhood) making adolescence either an adaptive or a challenging transition. There is a lack of sufficiently large longitudinal studies that have been able to study this interaction between genetics, biology and social environment on adolescent development. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of pubertal timing on social behaviour. Planned assessments and concepts are outlined.",

Por lo que el estrés sería una alarma, un estímulo que conduce a la acción, una respuesta necesaria para la supervivencia, respuesta que en la mayoría de los casos puede llegar a ser equilibrado o desequilibrado con las respuestas afectando a determinada población. El objetivo de este artículo va dirigido a determinar la importancia de identificar oportunamente los factores que pueden afectar negativamente la salud sexual y reproductiva del adolescente por este mal del siglo llamado estrés crónico. Para ello se consultaron varias fuentes bibliográficas que permitieron realizar un análisis crítico del estado del tema. Se concluye urge un abordaje holístico y humanizado del adolescente por estar socialmente expuesto a una exagerada recepción de estímulos externos e internos producto de diferentes fenómenos que generan el estrés crónico, alterando su procesamiento hormonal, neuronal y fisiológico que se encuentra inmaduro. Afectando de manera negativa su interacción social, su salud sexual y reproductiva las cuales se evidencian en cifras de suicidios, embarazos en la adolescencia, casos de drogadicción y abuso sexual en aumento.",

      "title": "Hypersexuality Addiction and Withdrawal: Phenomenology, Neurogenetics and Epigenetics",
      "abstract": "Hypersexuality has been defined as abnormally increased sexual activity. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that this non-paraphilic condition consists of \"excessive\" sexual behaviors and disorders accompanied by personal distress and social and medical morbidity. It is a very controversial and political topic in terms of how best to categorize it as similar or not similar to addictive behaviors including substance abuse. Hypersexual disorder is conceptualized as a non-paraphilic sexual desire disorder with impulsivity. Pathophysiological perspectives include dysregulation of sexual arousal and desire, sexual impulsivity, and sexual compulsivity. The nucleus accumbens, situated within the ventral striatum, mediates the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, and food as well as music. Indeed, it is believed that this structure mandates behaviors elicited by incentive stimuli. These behaviors include natural rewards like feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and exploratory locomotion. An essential rule of positive reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. Here, we are hypothesizing that there is a common mechanism of action (MOA) for the powerful effects drugs, music, food, and sex have on human motivation. The human drive for the three necessary motivational behaviors \"hunger, thirst, and sex\" may all have common molecular genetic antecedents that, if impaired, lead to aberrant behaviors. We hypothesize that based on a plethora of scientific support hypersexual activity is indeed like drugs, food, and music that activate brain mesolimbic reward circuitry. Moreover, dopaminergic gene and possibly other candidate neurotransmitter-related gene polymorphisms affect both hedonic and anhedonic behavioral outcomes. There is little known about both the genetics and epigenetics of hypersexuality in the current literature. However, we anticipate that future studies based on assessments with clinical instruments combined with genotyping of sex addicts will provide evidence for specific clustering of sexual typologies with polymorphic associations. There have been some studies using electrophysiological techniques that do not support the view that hypersexuality is indeed similar to substance abuse and other behavioral addictions. The authors are also encouraging both clinical and academic scientists to embark on research using neuroimaging tools to examine natural dopaminergic agonistic agents targeting specific gene polymorphisms to \"normalize\" hypersexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "Modern society breeds a search for the perfect body. Today's aesthetic ideal is extremely thin, and now, superimposed on this, is the need to be physically fit. People seek the ideal, not only because of expected health benefits, but because of what the ideal symbolizes in our culture (self-control, success, acceptance). Two assumptions are widespread with regard to body weight and shape. One is that the body is infinitely malleable, and that with the right combination of diet and exercise, every person can reach the ideal. The second is that vast rewards await the person who attains the ideal. Research has shown that biological variables, particularly genetics, are influential in the regulation of body weight and shape. Hence, there are limits to how much a person can change. This places culture in conflict with physiology. In addition, the rewards of being attractive are less than most would expect. There are serious consequences of seeking the ideal and falling short, some psychological and others physiological (e.g., increased health risk for weight cycling). Clinical and research efforts are necessary to help individuals establish reasonable weight and shape goals, and to educate the public accordingly.",

They often have a history of trauma. They are depressed and obsessive, attached to their mothers, who discourage attempts at emancipation. The symptoms serve the purpose of keeping them as little girls with negative feelings toward menstruation, sexual maturity, development, and femininity in general. These symptoms comprise self-destructive behavior in the service of removing sexual thoughts, temptation, and activities. Favazza (1987) included both eating disorders and self mutilation in his \"deliberate self-harm syndrome.\" The symptoms, whether they be anorexic, bulimic, or a form of self-mutilation are seen as \"autoerotic in nature and a substitute for normal masturbation\" (Hull & Lane, 1988). Eating disorders and delicate self-mutilation are said to have \"a cathartic, self-purifying, function in that they modulate states of anxiety, sexual tension, anger or dissociated emptiness, and they bring about a tremendous quasi-physical sense of relief\" (Cross, 1993, p. 50). These patients' use of substitutes prevents maturation and growth as women, causing regression to pregenital phases with the use of pregenital defenses, and the demise of the demands of puberty and mature sexuality.",

      "title": "Equitable Fraud: Material Exploitation in Domestic Settings",
      "abstract": "The security and well-being of older adults in the grey zone - not incapable but more vulnerable - is a key area of concern among practitioners and legislators. The diminished capability associated with disease may be gradual and spotty, a grey zone that can last for years. Other, non-medical factors are also significant: vulnerability arises by reason of an individual's total life situation, including relationships, education, experience, personality, and connection to society. Protecting the interests of the vulnerable but capable has been considered in terms of protection from abuse, and/or in terms of capacity. Each approach has significant conceptually structural problems. Unless a very narrow definition of is used (essentially replicating the criminal offences dealing with assault and theft) adult protection legislation has inappropriately paternalistic aspects; older adults are entitled to make objectively foolish choices, take risks, or prefer new, disreputable friends over older, staider ones. Older adults do not require protection from the consequences of their own choices, freely made. A finding of incapacity would resolve the difficulty by simply re-categorising the vulnerable person as incapable, a response that will often be excessive and result in an unwanted and unnecessary loss of independence. Modern least-intrusive adult guardianship legislation attempts to modify that all or nothing outcome through a scheme of graduated capacities. In reality neither paradigm - abuse or capacity - realistically captures or appropriately responds to the range of situations in which the vulnerable but capable adult requires the assistance and support of the law. Those situations are most accurately understood with reference to the conceptual framework of equitable fraud.",

      "title": "Emotional Neglect and it's Impact Upon the Self",
      "abstract": "Emotional neglect is one of the five sub-types of childhood mistreatment that has been classified by practitioners in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and education. The other four are sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and physical neglect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the least studied area from these five despite being commonly cited by research as being the most likely to occur. Contrary to what one might guess, numerous studies have in fact reported that emotional neglect can have an even greater negative impact upon individuals than the other types of mistreatment, particularly in regards to how individuals view themselves and their place in the world. Emotional neglect can broadly be defined as repeated and consistent caregiver-child interactions that are characterized by emotional unavailability, withdrawal, lack of reciprocity, disinterest or disengagement which lead to the child feeling that s/he is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs. Previous research has published findings strongly associating childhood emotional neglect with a range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, low self-compassion, shame, guilt, sexually risky behavior, self-destructive behavior, negative schemas, poor emotional regulation, Machiavellianism and so on. Given what we know in relation to the sheer importance of the interactions between primary caregivers and the child, namely by way of Bowlby's attachment theory, it is unsurprising to find that emotional neglect has many detrimental consequences. The reasons for emotional neglect can be numerous. One of the more common reasons behind it include it being passed on from generation to generation (as is also often the case with other types of abuse/neglect); indeed, social learning theory would support the idea that we take a lot of our parenting skills and styles directly from our own parents, even if we perceive them to be negative. Another source may be familial adversity, such as poverty, living within a conflict, or living during a time of persecution. Emotional neglect may also ensue due to the sickness of a sibling or parent, as the physically sick family member often can receive all attention and emotional capital of the family unit. Parental drug or alcohol abuse would place a child at risk of experiencing emotional neglect as would the seemingly more benign yet often just as threatening driven parental styles within which all love is contingent upon meeting pre-set academic or, later in life, professional goals. In the context of Qatar, it is also worth noting that emotional neglect often occurs within family units within which material wealth is abundant, however there is physical or psychological distance between the child and the primary caregiver, say due to a large number of siblings, half-siblings or maid/nursing staff being employed to take on child-rearing duties. Our emotional development, and being raised within a context in which we feel loved and cared for, is vital to the healthy development of the self. Accordingly, I have been looking at how emotional neglect impacts upon the self, that part of us that is believed to be the source of our consciousness and the core of our being. Two specific aspects of the self which I intend to include in my research are self-esteem and memory recall. Both of these areas have not been looked at in the context of emotional neglect research yet both may hold valuable findings that will then allow practitioners to be able to design interventions that will aide individuals in overcoming their emotional neglect. This will also be the first reported study that has used qualitative interviews to assess the impact of emotional neglect. This was also a key for me; through all the research I had reviewed, the emotion in emotional neglect was not being conveyed in the numbers and the statistics. Being a student of science though I know the value of these constructs and it was with both of these ideas in mind that I decided to use mixed methods for this doctorate study. This Ph.D. is currently being carried out by me at Queen's University Belfast, and is being supervised by, Dr Teresa Rushe.",

Vigorous training can reduce some components of biological age by as much as 20 yr, and it is manifestly unfair to require the retirement of those employees who have chosen a lifestyle that has conserved their physical condition.

When a child denies his or her talents, powers, and gender or aspects thereof, he or she loses quality of life, the ability to function, and physical or mental health. The loss of ability takes the form of diminished social ability, psychosexual potency, joy, energy, and fantasy while playing, as well as diminished ability to concentrate, focus, and learn. Many modifications result in a child with severely damaged self-confidence, self-worth, and poor performance. A child more or less deprived of self-worth cannot enjoy, give, or receive. A child deprived of emotions turns cold, rational, asocial, socially stiff, uncomfortable, and in the extreme case ... intentionally “evil”. When a child denies his or her own sex, it becomes invisible, uninteresting, and vague or becomes like the opposite sex in behavior and appearance. The general holistic solution to the vast diversity of symptoms in children with low quality of life is to improve the situation for the child and give the child the holding and support he or she needs. It is very important to realize that a negative belief often has survival value to the child as it helps the child to avoid taking responsibility for problems, which really belong to the parents or other adults. Children have a fine capability for spontaneous healing, and seem to enter this process more easily than adults, given sufficient holding. The symptoms of children with poor thriving ability are often difficult to understand, as they are caused by a complex combination of self-modification in five existential dimensions. This often leads to complex medical diagnosis, giving the idea that the child is sick and without therapeutic reach, while sufficient holding could solve the problem. If holding and support of the child is not enough, the situation must be carefully analyzed to find other possible causes of poor quality of life, health, and functional ability. Education of the parent in holding is often mandatory. Most children with bad thriving ability can thus be helped by simple means.",

      "abstract": "Cada vez nacen mas gemelos con discordancia de peso intrapar, factor de riesgo que puede afectar su desarrollo, especialmente el del hermano de menor peso intrapar. Sin embargo, pocos estudios abordan sus posibles disfunciones mas alla de las obstetricas; de modo que el conocimiento acerca de las consecuencias de la discordancia de peso intrapar en su desarrollo psicologico es escaso. Este trabajo revisa la literatura y recapitula las consecuencias de la discordancia de peso intrapar en el desarrollo psicologico de los gemelos de menor peso intrapar, comparativamente a sus hermanos de mas peso, asi como la perdurabilidad de dichas consecuencias durante su ciclo vital. La literatura revisada muestra que los gemelos de menor peso intrapar obtienen puntuaciones inferiores a sus hermanos en habilidades cognitivas, verbales y psicomotoras; y mayor probabilidad de presentar rasgos asociados al desarrollo de hiperactividad. Estas diferencias persisten desde la infancia hasta la juventud, no existiendo datos referidos a la edad adulta. En conclusion, las consecuencias de la discordancia de peso intrapar sobre el desarrollo psicologico de los gemelos de menor peso intrapar son extensas tanto en las dimensiones afectadas como en su perdurabilidad. Es necesaria una mayor investigacion que permita disenar intervenciones tempranas preventivas y optimizadoras del desarrollo de estos ninos; pues el optimo desarrollo de todos los ninos es la base de una sociedad en continuo progreso. Palabras Clave: Gemelaridad; Discordancia de Peso al Nacer; Desarrollo Atipico; Desarrollo Psicologico; Atencion Temprana. More twins are being born with intrapair birth weight discordances. Discordance in birth weight is a risk factor that can affect the development of twins, especially that of the lightest twin. However, few studies have analysed the possible consequences of birth weight discordance on the lightest twin beyond possible neonatal obstetric problems. Thus, little is known about the consequences of birth weight discordance on the psychological development of such babies. This article reviews the literature and summarizes the effects of birth weight discordance on the psychological development of the lightest intrapair twins compared with their heavier twin siblings and the persistence of these effects during their lifetime. The literature shows that the lightest intrapair twins obtain lower scores than their siblings in cognitive, verbal, and psychomotor skills. They are also more likely to have traits associated with the development of hyperactivity. These differences persist from childhood to youth. There is no information about adulthood. In conclusion, birth weight discordance has marked effects on the psychological development of intrapair lower weight twins, both in relation to the affected dimensions and the persistence of these effects over time. Further research is needed on designing early preventative interventions that would optimize the development of these children. This proposal is of relevance, given that the optimal development of all children is the basis of a society in continuous progress. Key words: Twins; Intertwin Birth Weight Discordance; Atypical Development; Psychological Development; Early Intervention.",

The poor and the rich are also involved in this dangerous habit that has impact not only on reproductive health but also has an impact on family, society, increase in health care expense and increased criminal activity. Health care providers are more concerned with treating the victims and less concerned on its prevention. Pregnant women bear greater brunt and there is adverse pregnancy outcome. Low birth weight, preterm labour, increased in miscarriage and raised perinatal mortality is some of the adverse effects. Children of such parents are more likely to inherit this bad trait. Children living in abusive homes where drugs and alcohol abuse occur simultaneously are often deprived of more than just the basics of food and shelter. Depression is defined as, “Any act on the part of the husband, partner or family which causes physical, mental, social or psychological trauma to the woman and prevent sher from developing her personality.” Reason for the increase in depression violence are; urbanization, industrialization, growth of urban slums, co-education and co - working in offices and factories, modern movies, television, obscene and pornographic literature and decreasing religious restrictions.",

People who deny this proposition frequently distinguish what they describe as mere biological human life from the of a person. It is persona/life, they say, that has value (even intrinsic value) and dignity; mere biological life does not. And personal is the of a being that possesses self-consciousness and, perhaps, developed capacities for characteristic human mental activity, such as conceptual thinking, deliberation, and choice. So some people argue that there are human beings who are not yet persons-namely, those in the embryonic, fetal, and at least early infant stages of developmentand other human beings who will never become, or are no longer, persons-theseverely retarded, the seriously demented, those in permanent comas or persistent vegetative states.

These findings demonstrate that the ongoing perception of one’s own body affects the sense of one’s own gender in a dynamic, robust, and automatic manner.",

Finally, N3 slow wave sleep undergoes a steady decline with age until it almost completely disappears in old age.

      "abstract": "While many life course transitions are associated with weight gain, marital separation follows a different trajectory and instead is associated with weight loss. Research remains inconclusive whether the weight changes are intentional or if they reflect more unintentional mechanisms. We first examine fluctuations in both objective (BMI) and subjective weight (self-rated weight and weight satisfaction) before, during, and after marital separation. In the year of separation, women’s BMI decreases by an average of 1 unit (equivalent to 6.3 pounds for a 5’5” woman), compared to a 0.3 unit decline for men (approximately 2 pounds for a 5’10” man). These patterns align with shifts in subjective weight: around the year of separation, men and women report greater weight satisfaction and women are less likely to perceive themselves as overweight. We then explore potential explanatory mechanisms to elucidate intentionality. Results indicate no substantial changes in dieting and exercise for women or men during marital dissolution but concurrent increases in psychological distress that are more substantial for men, highlighting that weight changes might be linked to unintentional stress-related mechanisms rather than intentional weight-loss behaviors. The findings shown here underscore the complex and socially embedded ways in which bodies respond to major life transitions.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining a good work ability depends on satisfactory health and employment status, which is supported by suitable working conditions and correct life styles. From the biological perspective, ageing means a foreseeable progressive and overall deterioration of the various physiological systems, but not of such a kind and severity to consider most people over 50 as too old or unfit for work, as has been shown by several studies that assessed work ability not only in terms of biological age, but of functional age and actual work output. From the physio-pathological perspective, we can observe either illnesses associated with the passage of time or age-related changes that might precipitate diseases, as well as environmental changes that modulate ageing and developmental changes that accelerate or retard ageing. From the practical point of view, it should taken into account that job demands often do not follow the natural biological and functional changes of the individual, consequently the relative work load can be higher in older workers. On the other hand, ageing also means a professional growth in terms of strategic ability, shrewdness, wisdom and experience. The high interindividual variability of physical, mental and social conditions that is observed with the increase in age makes it necessary to adopt flexible and personally tailored measures, as shown by recent surveys in some European countries aimed at reducing age discrimination and work disability, and at promoting work ability by means of actions directed towards both improvement of work organisation and support of psycho-physical conditions of older workers.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Intrinsic factors, such as age, weight and lifestyle habits, together with extrinsic factors, such as socioeconomic level, must be considered when it comes to reproductive healthcare. Over the last few years, studies that attempt to respond to the participation and interaction of these factors in subfertility have been published; however, some questions remain unanswered. Recent findings Although there are little modifiable factors for women, it is possible to influence other factors, such as behavioural or cultural factors in order to minimize fertility problems; however, they are often highly influenced by each other. Summary Advanced age, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol, tobacco and other compounds, have a clearly negative effect and may extend time-to-pregnancy, although the responsible mechanisms and the magnitude of the detriment that they produce in the reproductive health are yet to be studied. Economic context and new environmental factors are a current challenge for reproductive health too.",

      "title": "The effects of high altitude on adolescent growth in southern Peruvian Amerindians.",
      "abstract": "The growth in height, weight, and two thoracic diameters of three populations of southern Peruvian Amerindian children is described. The results indicate that altitude has an effect on the growth of height and weight during late childhood and a more dramatic effect on adolescent growth. Chest growth during this period appears to be very little affected. This finding may be explained by the hypothesis that chest growth is under different genetic control than the development of stature or weight and is relatively insensitive to the altitude-related environmental factors which affect general somatic growth rates. Several studies have demonstrated a slow rate of growth in human populations resident at high altitudes in the Andes (Frisancho and Baker, 1970; Haas, 1973; McClung, 1969). However, not all morphological structures appear to be equally affected during growth at high altitude. For example, Frisancho and Baker suggest that the growth of the chest dimensions may be accelerated while height and weight appear to be slowed. It is also possible that different stages of the life cycle may be unequally affected during development at high altitude. Periods of rapid growth such as adolescence may be more severely modified than periods of more leisurely growth such as childhood. The extent to which these responses are conditioned by the reduced oxygen pressure of high altitude is unclear. Other factors such as the limited energy availability in the Andean highaltitude ecosystem, a distinct genetic potential, or a combination of these may be responsible (Pawson, 1974; Thomas, 1973). It has not been possible to test these alternative hypotheses about child growth at high altitude in the Andes with the data available since low-altitude control populations were usually not available for comparison. In this report we describe the growth in height, weight, and chest dimensions of a sample of rural 1 Department of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.

      "abstract": "Categorization bias in social cognition is widely observed, as it is more beneficial to commit low-risk biases in order to reduce high-risk biases. In this context, a short age of the capacity to protect oneself when at high risk of approaching potentially harmful others, and hence, physical load and low physical fitness, are considered to be disadvantageous in self-protection. Thus, we hypothesized that a low capacity to self-protect leads to a biased social categorization of others as harmful. To examine this hypothesis, silhouettes of the human body, which had a sexually dimorphic cue (waist-to-hip ratio), were presented, and participants categorized the stimuli as female or male. Participants’ basic physical fitness was measured, and we manipulated physical load by a heavy or light backpack. Physical load did not significantly influence categorization. In contrast, only female participants tended to categorize the stimuli as male as basic physical fitness increased, suggesting that basic physical fitness, not physical load, affects sex categorization for females. Our findings shed new light on the effect of fitness factors on social cognition.",

At this time, a person more likely to adjust to many changes that happen in life such as declining physical ability, death of husband or wife, or friends age, retirement, and face the empty cage (empty nest), When the elderly unable to adjust to these circumstances, the elderly will feel lonely, a feeling of emptiness in social relations marked by a feeling alienated, rejected, abandoned, worthless, and felt alienated in a common life with others so that individuals feel their social relationships unsatisfactory that ultimately led to individuals experienced a\r\ndecrease both physical and psychological health. Loneliness experienced by the elderly if left unchecked will lead to a protracted prolonged stress, which in akhinya will fall into a condition called the tendency of depression, a condition that refers to the mood or feeling of profound melancholy and gloomy because of the conditions that affect aspects of one's life. This research is aimed to know the relationship between feeling lonely with the tendency of depression in the elderly. The samples studied were elderly people aged from 60-80 at the United superannuated Republic of Indonesia (PWRI), which numbered 30 people. Sampling was purposive sampling. Research instrument used was a scale. Then the data were analyzed using product moment correlation test. Results The study stated there is a very significant positive relationship between a sense of loneliness with a tendency to depression in the elderly. With r = 0.534 and p = 0.002 so the hypothesis is accepted, ie if the higher sense of loneliness, the higher the tendency of depression, and conversely the lower the sense of loneliness, the tendency of depression experienced by the lower. The amount of effective contribution to the tendency of depression loneliness of 28.5% and the remaining 71.5% are influenced by other variables not studied.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents experience maltreatment at rates equal to or exceeding those of younger children. Recent increases in reported cases of maltreatment have occurred disproportionately among older children and adolescents. However, adolescents are less likely to be reported to child protective services and are more likely to be perceived as responsible for their maltreatment. Adolescent girls are reported as victims more often than boys, especially in sexual abuse. However, boys may be less likely to be identified or reported and often are abused by nonfamily members. Parents of adolescent victims have higher average income and educational levels and are less likely to have a parental history of abuse than parents of younger children. A wide range of serious adolescent risk behaviors is associated with maltreatment. These include increased risk of premature sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, emotional disorders, suicide attempts, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug abuse, and delinquent behavior. Incarcerated youth, homeless or runaway youth, and youth who victimize siblings or assault parents have been shown to have high rates of prior maltreatment. Signs of maltreatment are often ambiguous for adolescents. Screening questions have been effective in prompting self-disclosure of abuse. Adolescents also experience problems in the child welfare system that offers fewer and less appropriate services for this age group. Recommendations are made regarding screening of adolescents for maltreatment, the development of better services for adolescents, research on parenting to prevent maltreatment, and training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment.",

Changing sleep in teens results in their not becoming tired until 11 : 00 in the evening despite the fact that they have to get up approximately five to six hours later. Therefore, from a general perspective-by virtue of not being tired due to hard wired developmental changes in their sleep-all teenagers are boxed in by not being tired until later evening hours yet having to get up even earlier than they did in junior high years. Their sleep is limited by a lack of tiredness and society demands of school start times, automatically resulting in unfulfilled sleep needs and building sleep deprivation.",

The drive to be thin can lead to problematic eating patterns, such as self-starvation, binge-eating, and purging, symptoms of the eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Most current literature on eating disorders and the drive for thinness focuses only on White middle-class women and girls. African American females have been largely excluded from studies, due to the assumption that the Black community's acceptance of women with fuller shapes protects its women from eating problems. However, recent studies are beginning to show that race, class, and exposure to a dominant culture which denigrates Black features and physiques impact body image among Black women and may play a role in the development of eating problems.",

First, with the passage of time, progressively diminished physical reserves are an inevitable part of aging, but, of course, the rate at which these diminished reserves occur is variable. Second, physical health can involve experiencing the biological ravages of age without feeling sick. Third, age and social class are important. The mission of positive aging is to add more life to years, not just more years to life. Results of the Study of Adult Development show that much of a septuagenarian's positive aging or lack of it is determined by controllable factors established before the age of 50. Seven factors that predict positive aging are not being a smoker, adaptive coping style, absence of alcohol abuse, healthy weight, stable marriage, exercise, and more years of education.",

      "abstract": "La tasa instantánea de mortalidad natural, m, es un parámetro clave estimado en las evaluaciones de las poblaciones de peces. Convencionalmente, se ha supuesto que m es constante a lo largo del tiempo y la edad; sin embargo, este supuesto usualmente genera una subestimación del reclutamiento y una sobreestimación de la población reproductora. Si una población de peces se explota hasta el límite de su capacidad de producción biológica o si está en una condición de sobrepesca de reclutamiento o crecimiento, entonces es importante aumentar la precisión al estimar los sobrevivientes de edades críticas. La estimación de m por edad/talla se basa en la noción de que m varía con la ontogenia de una especie. Casi todos los métodos para estimar m por edad/talla están vinculados a estimaciones de crecimiento individual para aproximarse a la ontogenia de las especies. El método de intervalos gnomónicos permite estimaciones de m en etapas de la historia de vida que son biológica y ecológicamente consistentes con los datos observados, y estas estimaciones pueden traducirse a longitud y edad. En México, se han aplicado métodos basados en longitud y crecimiento a algunas especies de almejas Veneridae; mientras que el método de intervalos gnomónicos se ha aplicado a especies con diferentes historias de vida, como camarones peneidos de corta longevidad (Penaeus spp.); especies longevas, tales como el mero rojo (Epinephelus morio), predador tope, y la almeja de sifón (Panopea globosa), una especie filtradora; y especies con longevidad intermedia e historias de vida variadas tales como pequeños pelágicos (Sardinops caeruleus); un depredador de nivel trófico intermedio, el calamar gigante (Dosidiscus gigas); y el pepino de mar (Isostichopus badionotus). Cabe señalar que, en los casos estudiados, el método del intervalo gnomónico no consideró la variabilidad en el tiempo, sólo para las etapas de la historia de vida, mientras que los métodos basados en la longitud y el crecimiento pueden aplicarse para estimar la mortalidad natural variable en el tiempo, como en el caso de la almeja roñosa (Chione californiensis). El análisis mostró que las estimaciones sesgadas del tamaño de la población, que ocurrieron debido a la suposición de una mortalidad natural constante con la ontogenia, fueron mayores para las especies de vida corta que para las de vida larga; mientras que las estimaciones variables en el tiempo de m mostraron un sesgo de aproximadamente ± 35% en un marco de tiempo estacional para la almeja roñosa C. californiensis.",

      "title": "Disciplining Bodies: The Aging Experiences of Older Heterosexual and Gay Men",
      "abstract": "This article explores ways that men in later life may attempt to retain or regain notions of youthful manhood-in particular, by disciplining their bodies through exercise or dieting. Sexual orientation is also a focus because it shapes experiences with manhood and with aging. Because heterosexuality is venerated and homosexuality stigmatized, gay men may experience old age differently compared to heterosexual men. Throughout paper, I draw on unpublished empirical data collected through intensive interviews with a group of fifty-two heterosexual and homosexual men who are in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. Interestingly, at least for this small, nonrandom sample of older, mostly privileged men, exercise and diet, health behaviors I explore in this paper, evidence no discernable differences between gay and heterosexual respondents. Both groups of respondents attempt to deal with stigma of aging bodies by engaging in fitness activities and body maintenance techniques that emphasize youthful appearances. Of course, relations of power shape relations between gender, age, race, sexuality, and body; variability in aging experiences is norm, not exception. BODIES, AGING, AND AGEISM While ways that people experience their bodies have garnered significant attention in recent decades, until recently, scholarship has largely ignored aging bodies (Calasanti and Slevin, 2001; Fairdoth, 2003; Katz, 2005; Slevin, 2006). Cruikshank (2003) also reminds us that despite body's critical role as a marker of age, even social gerontologists have given it scant attention in understanding how we experience aging of body, except in cases of disease and illness (Cruikshank, 2003). Tge researchers who have focused on bodies of people in later and even mid life have primarily emphasized loss of function; emphasis has been on a narrative of decline (Gullette, 1997). Indeed, because commonplace physical experiences with aging bodies are ignored, older people experience their bodies in an environment of profound cultural silence (Twigg, 2000, p. 115). Yet, story of aging is intimately connected with meanings we ascribe to our aging bodies. Indeed, these meanings are critical to making sense of age and aging (Laz, 2003). Laz (1998) also reminds us that age is an accomplishment, that it is more social than chronological. At same time, body has definite biological and physiological characteristics-bodies are more than social constructions-they do age and we do eventually die (Turner, 1996). Within literature on body, scholars have given little attention to empirically exploring accuracy of their broad and often sweeping theoretical claims (Williams and Bendelow, 1998). There has been little attention to the voices that emanate from bodies themselves (Nettleton and Watson, 1998, p. 2). With exception of a sizable volume of empirical literature on chronic illness and disability, embodied experience of people in their everyday worlds is absent. In our culture, growing old and being old are constructed as a problem, and we are now led to believe that not only can we chart paths of how we grow old, we can go farther and decide whether we do it at all. Apparently, technology has trumped biology; growing old has become new century's solvable problem (Cruikshank, 2003). Accordingly, widely preached exhortation to accept old age with grace is, in feet, no longer supported by practice (Gilleard and Higgs, 2000). Indeed, nowadays-at least in many Western societies-old age is seen as a pathology and stigmatized; more and more, it is viewed as a personal failure-one that especially affects those who lack requisite economic resources or physical abilities to partake of consumerism that surrounds aging (Katz, 2005). Consumerism touts desirable bodies as those that are young, toned, and thin; media convey to us that to be young and beautiful is to possess most desirable form of cultural capital. …",

      "abstract": "A sociedade atual tem valorizado de forma significativa a aparência alta e esbelta. Essa constituição física tem sido reforçada desde a infância e atinge a população adolescente, que deseja enquadrar-se nos estereótipos, particularmente aqueles veiculados pela mídia. Nesse sentido, profissionais de saúde são questionados rotineiramente sobre os efeitos positivos que o exercício físico exerce sobre o crescimento longitudinal de crianças e adolescentes. Procurou-se revisar a literatura especializada a respeito dos principais efeitos que o exercício físico exerceria sobre a secreção e atuação do hormônio de crescimento (GH) nos diversos tecidos corporais, durante a infância e adolescência. Através dessa revisão, foi possível verificar que o exercício físico induz a estimulação do eixo GH/IGF-1. Embora muito se especule quanto ao crescimento ósseo ser potencializado pela prática de exercícios físicos, não foram encontrados na literatura científica específica estudos bem desenvolvidos que forneçam sustentação a essa afirmação. No tocante aos efeitos adversos advindos do treinamento físico durante a infância e adolescência, aparentemente, esses foram independentes do tipo de esporte praticado, porém resultantes da intensidade do treinamento. A alta intensidade do treinamento parece ocasionar uma modulação metabólica importante, com a elevação de marcadores inflamatórios e a supressão do eixo GH/IGF-1. Entretanto, é importante ressaltar que a própria seleção esportiva, em algumas modalidades, recruta crianças e/ou adolescentes com perfis de menor estatura, como estratégia para obtenção de melhores resultados, em função da facilidade mecânica dos movimentos. Através dessa revisão, fica evidente a necessidade de realização de estudos longitudinais, nos quais os sujeitos sejam acompanhados antes, durante e após sua inserção nas atividades esportivas, com determinação do volume e da intensidade dos treinamentos, para que conclusões definitivas relativas aos efeitos sobre a estatura final possam ser emanadas.",

Because infancy and childhood are critical periods in physiological development and in the establishment of habits, this period is considered as having the greatest potential for the prevention of obesity. Furthermore, obesity developed during infancy imposes special difficulties for weight reduction later in life. Certain environmental conditions and cultural practices may be implicated in the etiology of infantile obesity. It appears that the artificially fed baby introduced to solid foods at an early age may be at an increased risk of being overfed compared with the solely breastfed baby who is weaned gradually onto non-milk foods in the second half of the first year. It must be recognized that social, cultural, economic and psychological factors can interfere with established principles of human nutrition. Long term benefits must come from educating parents so that soundly based principles of nutrition are incorporated into infant feeding practices.",

      "abstract": "Prematurely-born infants usually experience an initial arrest or delay In development during the early weeks after birth, but thereafter they resume growing at an accelerated rate that enables them eventually to overtake their termborn contemporaries in weight, height, and other physical features and in intellectual attainments. When prematures catch up with their birth age they are likely to vanish into the general child population, and the fact of their premature birth is no longer regarded as particularly significant in their behavioral development. The possibility that premature ejection of an individual into a world he has not yet grown up to fit may have lasting social and emotional consequences is an intriguing problem for the student of personality. Certainly the seven-months baby offers to the physiological psychologist an experimental animal somewhat comparable in neurophysical development to the pouch-young opossum and the experimentally delivered guinea-pig.",

Most countries, including Slovakia, support policies to improve the lifestyle of the population through sport. The general mission of sport is also used as a means of promoting tolerance. Despite this, a negative phenomenon such as discrimination also occurs in the field of sport. The aim of the contribution, which has the character of a theoretical study, is to point out discrimination occurring in the sports environment. Its main determinants are associated with a low level of culture, legal nihilism, xenophobia and intolerance. Manifestations of discrimination have a negative impact both on athletes, whose psyche is already exposed to serious stress, and on society, which is unfortunately burdened by the presence of prejudices on an ethnic, religious and racial basis.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of male and female infertility is being increased in many nations and has emerged as a serious problem. Many life style factors and occupational exposures can have substantial effects on fertility problems. Life style factors such as smoking, illicit drug (cocaine, cannabis), alcohol and caffeine consumption, exposure to extreme heat etc. have negative effects on functions of male reproductive system. In recent years, increase in disorders of male reproductive system may be associated at least some extent with these factors; which are enhanced by some of new emergent life style habits. A detailed study is required based on the data i.e., excess use of mobile phones and impact of mental stress on male reproductive health. This review highlights the role of various life style factors, environmental stresses and occupational exposures in male reproductive functions and their negative feedback in declining semen quality, increased oxidative stress as well as sperm DNA damages in male. Increase in reproductive disorder in male may be correlated at least in part with these factors, which are further added by some of new emergent life styles. Sub-fertile and/or even normal individuals have some control over their reproductive function by adopting healthy lifestyles.",

      "abstract": "Familial short stature (FSS) is a condition in which the final adult height achieved is less than the third percentile for the patient's age, gender, and population. Nevertheless, it is consistent with parental height in the absence of nutritional, hormonal, acquired, genetic, and iatrogenic causes. It is considered one of the most common causes of short stature along with the constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP) from which it can easily be distinguished.A child presenting with short stature (SS) two or more standard deviations (SD) below the mean for age, gender, and population where no other causes can be found is deemed to have idiopathic short stature (ISS). Having adopted this definition, some authorities have included cases of FSS and CDGP as part of ISS. Hence, a category of familial ISS is distinguished from the non-familial ISS. On the other hand, others have listed it as a separate entity. Regardless of the classification which one follows, it is clear that FSS is a distinct entity whereby patients attain a final adult height consistent with their target height, unlike ISS. Thus, the final height attained is considerably less than the ultimate expected height in ISS.Although the consensus is that small cumulative effects of multiple genes are responsible for FSS, it is being questioned, especially when the SS condition is extreme. This may be especially true, as more and more monogenic gene defects are discovered in cases diagnosed either as FSS or ISS and other family members. This article addresses the features of FSS and covers distinctions among CDGP, ISS, and other causes of short stature. It also describes the latest advances in the study of various monogenic gene defects discovered in cases of SS, occurring in some families.",

      "title": "Health-related behaviours in context",
      "abstract": "Health behaviours, sometimes referred to as (health) risk behaviours, theoretically refer to any practices, habits or actions which, either in the short or long term, have an effect on health, either positively or negatively. In medicine generally, and life-course epidemiology specifically, they are often conceptualized as components of an individual's lifestyle, or even as lifestyles themselves. By virtue of human agency, or at least the potential for agency, they are distinguished from social structure (e.g. social class) which is typically understood as an external (material and/or cultural) constraint. In most studies, they are usually represented by four behaviours; diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, and (increasingly) in the case of young people illicit drug use. Sexual behaviour is also referred to, but as the subject of another chapter, is not included here. From a sociological perspective, these behaviours are not so easily reducible to lifestylevariables, nor are they necessarily dis-embedded from social structure. Each is imbued with social meaning, both in the way they are socially constructed through, for example, advertising and the media and in the way they are consumed, and displayed by individuals. For young people, they are especially strong signifiers of identity since they are so closely connected with the youth-adult transition, minimum ages for the legal purchase of tobacco and alcohol marking stages in the achievement of adult status in most developed countries. They are also remarkably precise signifiers of youth identities, group membership and subcultures, as indicated by the way particular young people engage in physical activity (and which activities), whether they smoke or drink (and which brands they consume) or use illicit drugs (and which drugs). The extent to which such health behaviours continue to be shaped by social structures such as social class, and the extent to which they are lifestyle choices, is an important indicator of where any society is positioned in late modernity. This chapter begins with a brief overview of the social epidemiology of diet, physicalactivity, smoking, drinking and drug use among youth in developed societies, focusing on health consequences, prevalence issues, and age, gender and cross-national variations. A review of ethnic group and religious differences is beyond the scope of the chapterthough they are clearly important (e.g. for diet and alcohol). Developing from this, against the background of the structure/agency debate (Furlong and Cartmel 2007), and representing the former by young people's social class of origin, the latter by various lifestyles, an assessment is made of the relative importance of each for health behaviours in contemporary society. The chapter concludes with a closer look at the social contexts within which young people's health behaviours are developed, and the social processes involved. It is within these particular contexts, notably the school and the peer group, that the meaning of health behaviours for identity, group membership and lifestyles can best be understood. Because most research has been undertaken on young people of school-age, the focus is primarily on 'early youth' though the implications extend beyond school.",

The objective of this study was to analyze the anchor system as a potential tool for decreasing body sway in older and young adults. Older adults had more postural sway than their young counterparts. The absence of visual information led to larger instability in both groups. The anchor system improved postural stability of both groups.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Fecal Incontinence",
      "abstract": "DEFINITION Fecal incontinence is defined as either the involuntary passage or the inability to control the discharge of fecal matter through the anus. Clinically there are three subtypes (a) passive incontinence—the involuntary discharge of stool or gas without awareness; (b) urge incontinence—the discharge of fecal matter in spite of active attempts to retain bowel contents, and (c) fecal seepage—the leakage of stool following otherwise normal evacuation. The severity of incontinence can range from the unintentional elimination of flatus to the seepage of liquid fecal matter or sometimes the complete evacuation of bowel contents. Not surprisingly, these events cause considerable embarrassment, which in turn can lead to a loss of self-esteem, social isolation, and a diminished quality of life (1). EPIDEMIOLOGY Although fecal incontinence affects people of all ages, its prevalence is disproportionally higher in women, in the elderly, and in nursing home residents. Estimates of its prevalence vary greatly and depend on the clinical setting, the influence of social stigma, the definition of incontinence, and the frequency of occurrence. In the U.S. householder survey, frequent leakage of stool or fecal staining for more than 1 month was reported by 7.1% and 0.7% of the population, respectively (2). In contrast, two or more episodes of fecal incontinence per month were reported by 0.8% of patients presenting to primary care clinics in the UK (3). In an elderly (>65 yr) self-caring population, fecal incontinence occurred at least once a week in 3.7% of subjects and in more men than women (men:women = 1.5:1) (4). In contrast, 25–35% of institutionalized patients (5) and 10–25% of hospitalized geriatric patients (6) suffer from fecal incontinence. In the United States, fecal incontinence is the second leading cause for placement in nursing homes (6). In a survey of 2,570 households, comprising 6,959 individuals, the prevalence of at least one episode of incontinence during the previous year was 2.2%; among these 63% were women, 30% were >65 yr of age, 36% were incontinent of solid stool, 54% of liquid stool, and 60% of flatus (7). Furthermore, in another prospective survey of patients attending either a gastroenterology or a primary care clinic, over 18% reported fecal incontinence at least once a week (8). Only one third had ever discussed the problem with a physician (8). When stratified for the frequency of episodes, 2.7% of patients reported daily incontinence, 4.5% weekly, and 7.1% once per month (8). In another survey, fecal incontinence was associated with urinary incontinence in 26% of women attending a Uro/Gyn Clinic (9). A higher incidence of mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was also reported in nursing home residents (10, 11). The cost of health care related to fecal incontinence includes items that can be measured such as the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of incontinence, medications, the use of disposable pads and other ancillary devices, skin care, and nursing care. Approximately $400 million/year were spent for adult diapers (8, 12) and between $1.5 and $7 billion/year were spent on care for incontinence among institutionalized elderly patients (6, 13). In a long-term facility, the annual cost for a patient with both mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was $9,711 (14). In the outpatient setting, the average cost per patient (including evaluation) was estimated at $17,166 (15). Additionally, there are other costs that cannot be measured such as the impaired quality of life and social dysfunction (1). SUMMARY. The prevalence of fecal incontinence ranges between 1% and 7.4% in otherwise healthy people and up to 25% in those who are institutionalized. Both the embarrassment and the social stigma attached to this disorder, often delay presentation as well as treatment for several years. Fecal incontinence not only causes significant morbidity in the community but it also consumes substantial health care resources. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Functional Anatomy and Physiology of the Anorectum The neuromuscular integrity of the rectum, anus, and the adjoining pelvic floor musculature helps to maintain normal fecal continence. The rectum is a muscular tube composed of a continuous layer of longitudinal muscle that interlaces with the underlying circular muscle. This unique muscle arrangement enables the rectum to serve both as a reservoir for stool and as a pump for emptying stool. The anus is a muscular tube 2–4 cm. long, which at rest forms an angle with the axis of the rectum. At rest, the anorectal angle is approximately 90 degrees, with voluntary squeeze it becomes more acute, approximately 70 degrees, and during defecation it becomes more obtuse, about 110–130 degrees. The anal sphincter consists of the internal anal sphincter, which is a 0.3–0.5 cm thick expansion of the circular smooth muscle layer of the rectum, and the external anal sphincter which is a 0.6–1 cm thick expansion of the striated levator ani muscles. Morphologically, both sphincters are separate and heterogeneous (16). The anus is normally closed by the tonic activity of the internal anal sphincter and this barrier is reinforced by the external anal sphincter during voluntary squeeze. The anal mucosal folds together with the expansile anal vascular cushions provide a tight seal. These mechanical barriers are augmented by the puborectalis muscle, which forms a flap-like valve that creates a forward pull and reinforces the anorectal angle to prevent incontinence (16). The anorectum is innervated by sensory, motor, and autonomic parasympathetic nerves as well as by the enteric nervous system. The principal nerve is the pudendal nerve, which arises from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves and innervates the external anal sphincter, the anal mucosa, and the anorectal wall. This is a mixed nerve and subserves both sensory and motor function (17). Its course through the pelvic floor makes it vulnerable to stretch injury, particularly during vaginal delivery. It is likely that rectal contents are periodically sensed by the process of \"ano rectal sampling\" (18, 19). This process may be facilitated by transient relaxations of the internal anal sphincter that allows the movement of stool or flatus from the rectum into the upper anal canal where they may come into contact with specialized sensory end organs such as the numerous Krause end-bulbs, Golgi–Mazzoni bodies and genital corpuscles and the relatively sparse Meissner's corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles (20). Specialized afferent nerves for touch, cold, tension, and friction subserve these organized nerve endings. An intact \"sampling reflex\" allows the individual to choose whether to discharge or retain their rectal contents, whereas an impaired \"sampling reflex\" may predispose to incontinence (19, 20). In contrast, the rectal epithilium shows no organized nerve endings (21). Myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers are present adjacent to the rectal mucosa, the submucosa and the myenteric plexus. These subserve the sensation of distention and stretch and mediate the viscero-visceral, the rectoanal inhibitory, and contractile responses (22). The sensation of rectal distention travels along the parasympathetic system to S2, S3, and S4 (21). Thus, the sacral nerves are intimately involved with the sensory, motor, and autonomic function of the anorectum and in maintaining continence. Pathogenic Mechanisms and Etiology Incontinence occurs when one or more mechanisms that maintain continence are disrupted to an extent that other mechanisms are unable to compensate. Thus, the cause of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial (23–25). In a prospective study, 80% of patients had more than one pathogenic abnormality (23). In adult women, obstetric trauma is a major predisposing factor (26). This injury may involve either the external anal sphincter, the internal anal sphincter, or the pudendal nerves or all three structures. In prospective studies, nearly 35% of primiparous women (normal ante partum) showed evidence of sphincter disruption following vaginal delivery (26–28). Other important risk factors include forceps delivery, prolonged second stage of labor, large birth weight, and occipito-posterior presentation (29–31). Perineal tears, even when carefully repaired, can be associated with incontinence, and patients may either present immediately or several years following delivery (27). Other causes of anatomic disruption include iatrogenic factors such as anorectal surgery for hemorrhoids, fistulas, or fissures. Anal dilatation or lateral sphincterotomy may result in permanent incontinence due to fragmentation of the internal anal sphincter (32, 33). The internal anal sphincter is occasionally and inadvertently damaged during hemorrhoidectomy (34). Accidental perineal trauma or a pelvic fracture may also cause direct sphincter trauma leading to incontinence (35). In the absence of structural defects, internal anal sphincter dysfunction may occur because of a myopathy (36, 37), or internal sphincter degeneration (37), or a complication of radiotherapy (38, 39). Neurological diseases can affect continence by interfering with either sensory perception or motor function, or both. In the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, brain tumors, sedation, dorsal and spinal cord lesion may each cause incontinence (40–43). In the peripheral nervous system, cauda equina lesions, diabetic neuropathy (41, 44, 45), toxic neuropathy from alcohol, or traumatic neuropathy in the post partum setting may all lead to fecal incontinence. Up to 30% of patients with multiple sclerosis are incontinent (41). Skeletal muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and other myopathies can affect external anal sphincter and puborectalis function. Reconstructive procedures such as ileoanal (46) or coloanal pouches (47) can increase anorectal capacity and may improve continence. However, up to 40% of patients with an ileoanal pouch experience periodic, often nocturnal fecal incontinence, possibly related to uncoordinated pouch contractions (48). Similarly, rectal prolapse may be associated with fecal incontinence in up to 88% of cases (49–51). This is most likely due to prolonged inhibition of anal tone from intussusception of the rectum into the upper anal canal. Conditions that decrease rectal compliance and accommodation may also cause fecal incontinence (52). Etiologies include radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis, rectal inflammation secondary to ulcerative colitis (53, 54), or Crohn's disease and infiltration of the rectum by tumor, ischemia, or following radical hysterectomy (39). Rarely other causes include high intrarectal pressures generated in some patients with ulcerative colitis (53), or with severe voluminous diarrhea (55). In many patients fecal seepage or staining of undergarments is due to the incomplete evacuation of stool. A majority of these patients show obstructive or dyssynergic defecation (56). In these patients, anal sphincter and pudendal nerve function are intact but the ability to evacuate stool is impaired (56). Many also exhibit impaired rectal sensation (56, 57). Similarly, in the elderly and in children with functional incontinence, the prolonged retention of stool in the rectum leads to fecal impaction. Fecal impaction causes prolonged relaxation of the internal anal sphincter tone that allows liquid stool to flow around impacted stool and to escape through the anal canal (58). SUMMARY. Anal sphincter disruption or weakness, pudendal neuropathy, impaired anorectal sensation, impaired rectal accommodation, or incomplete evacuation may all contribute to the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence. These changes may be a consequence of local, anatomical, or systemic disorders. Thus, the origin of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Patients with fecal incontinence may be categorized into passive or urge incontinence or fecal seepage and their severity can be graded based on a prospective stool diary and clinical features. The evaluation of a patient with fecal incontinence involves a detailed clinical assessment together with the appropriate physiological and imaging tests of the anorectum. These three sources of information are complementary and should provide useful data regarding the severity of the problem, the underlying etiological factors, and the impact of the problem on the quality of life. Equipped with this knowledge, it is possible to design appropriate treatment strategies that could lead to clinical improvement. Clinical Features Many patients who suffer with fecal incontinence or soiling, take refuge under the term \"diarrhea\" or \"urgency\" (59). Thus, the first step in the evaluation is to establish a rapport with the patient and to confirm the existence of fecal incontinence. Thereafter, further characterization is desirable. This can include an assessment of its duration, its progression, its nature, i.e., incontinence of flatus, liquid stool, or solid stool, and its impact on the quality of life (Table 1). The use of pads or other devices and the ability to discriminate between formed or unformed stool and gas should be enquired. A detailed inquiry should also include obstetric history, a history of coexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pelvic radiation, neurological problems or spinal cord injury, dietary history, and a history of coexisting urinary incontinence. Also, during clinical assessment, it is useful to ask if a patient can differentiate between formed and unformed stool or flatus, i.e., the presence of rectoanal agnosia. A prospective stool diary may also be very useful (Fig. 1).Table 1: A List of Important Information That Should be Elicited When Taking a History in a Patient with Suspected Fecal IncontinenceFigure 1: A sample stool diary for assessing patients with fecal incontinence. Use the following descriptors for describing stool consistency: Type 1: Separate hard lumps. Type 2: Sausage shaped but lumpy. Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface. Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft. Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily). Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool. Type 7: Watery.The circumstances under which incontinence occurs should also be determined. Such a detailed inquiry may facilitate the identification of the following possible scenarios: Passive incontinence—which is the involuntary discharge of fecal matter or flatus without any awareness. This suggests a loss of perception and/or impaired rectoanal reflexes either with or without sphincter dysfunction. Urge incontinence—which is the discharge of fecal matter or flatus in spite of active attempts to retain these contents. Here, there is a predominant disruption of the sphincter function or the rectal capacity to retain stool. Fecal seepage—which is the undesired leakage of stool, often after a bowel movement with otherwise normal continence and evacuation. This condition is mostly due to incomplete evacuation of stool and/or impaired rectal sensation (56, 58). The sphincter function and pudendal nerve function are mostly intact (56, 57). Although there is an overlap between these three groups, by making a clinical distinction, it is possible to assess the underlying etiology and to guide investigations and management. Symptom assessment can also provide useful insights regarding the underlying mechanism(s), but may not correlate well with manometric findings. In one study, leakage had a sensitivity of 98.9%, a specificity of 11%, and a positive predictive value of 51% for detecting low resting anal sphincter pressures (31). The positive predictive value for detecting a low squeeze pressure was 80% (31). Thus, for an individual patient with incontinence, history and clinical features alone are insufficient to define the pathophysiology and therefore objective testing is essential. Nevertheless, based on the clinical features, several grading systems have been proposed. Recently, a modification of the Cleveland Clinic grading system (60) has been validated by the St. Mark's investigators (61). This system can provide an objective method of quantifying the degree of incontinence. It can also be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapy. This grading system is based on seven parameters that include whether the anal discharge is either solid, liquid or flatus, and whether the problem causes alterations in lifestyle, (scores: Never = 0, Always = 5); the need to wear a pad or the need to take antidiarrheal medication, and the ability to defer defecation (scores: No—0, yes—2). The score ranges from 0 (continent) to 24 (severe incontinence). Clinical features alone are, however, insufficient to define the pathophysiology. The use of validated questionnaires such as the SCL-90R SF-36 may provide additional information regarding the psychosocial issues and impact on the quality of or life. Physical Examination This should include a detailed physical and neurological examination of the back and the lower limbs, because incontinence may be secondary to a systemic or a neurological disorder. The perineal inspection and digital rectal examination is best performed with the patient lying in the left lateral position and with good illumination. Upon inspection, the presence of fecal matter, prolapsed hemorrhoids, dermatitis, scars, skin excoriation, the absence of perianal creases, or a gaping anus may be noted. These features suggest either sphincter weakness or chronic skin irritation and provide clues regarding the underlying etiology. Excessive perineal descent or rectal prolapse can be demonstrated by asking the patient to attempt defecation. An outward bulge that exceeds 3 cm is usually defined as excessive perineal descent (62). The perianal sensation should also be checked. The anocutaneous reflex examines the integrity of the connection between the sensory nerves and the skin, the intermediate neurons in the spinal cord segments S2, S3, and S4, and the motor innervation of the external anal sphincter. This can be assessed by gently stroking the perianal skin with a cotton bud in each of the perianal quadrants. The normal response consists of a brisk contraction of the external anal sphincter. Impaired or absent anocutaneous reflex suggests either afferent or efferent neuronal injury (63). Digital Rectal Examination Recommendation: Digital rectal examination can identify patients with fecal impaction and overflow. It is not accurate enough for diagnosing sphincter dysfunction or for initiating therapy. After inserting a lubricated, gloved index finger, one should assess the resting sphincter tone, the length of the anal canal, the integrity of the puborectalis sling, the acuteness of the anorectal angle, the strength of the anal muscle, and the elevation of the perineum during voluntary squeeze. Also, the presence of a rectocele or impacted stools may be noted. Unlike the examination of other organs, one should exercise considerable sensitivity and allay any fears when performing a digital rectal examination. The accuracy of digital rectal examination—as an objective test for evaluating anal sphincter function—has been assessed in several studies. In one study of 66 patients, digital examination by an experienced surgeon was somewhat correlated with resting sphincter pressure (r = 0.56; p < 0.001) or maximum squeeze pressure (r = 0.72: p < 0.001) (64). In another study of 280 patients with several anorectal disorders, a reasonable correlation was reported between digital palpation and manometry (65). However, the sensitivity, the specificity, and the positive predictive value of the digital exam were very low (65). By the digital exam, the positive predictive value of detecting a low sphincter tone was 66.7% and a low squeeze tone was 81% (31). In another study of 64 patients, the agreement between digital examination and resting anal canal pressure or squeeze pressure was 0.41 and 0.52, respectively (66). These data suggest that digital examination is only an approximation, which is influenced by many factors including the size of the examiner's finger, the technique, and the cooperation of the patient. Thus, it is not very reliable and is prone to interobserver differences.Table 2: Treatment of Fecal IncontinenceINVESTIGATIONS OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Endoscopic evaluation of the rectosigmoid region is appropriate for detecting mucosal disease or neoplasia that may contribute to fecal incontinence. At the outset it is important to distinguish whether the incontinence is either secondary to diarrhea or independent of stool consistency. If there is coexisting diarrhea, a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed to exclude colonic mucosal inflammation, a rectal mass, or stricture. Stool studies, including stool screening for infection, stool volume, stool osmolality and electrolytes may be performed. Similarly, biochemical tests may reveal thyroid dysfunction, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Breath tests may reveal lactose or fructose intolerance or bacterial overgrowth (24). Several specific tests are available for defining the underlying mechanisms of fecal incontinence (23, 52, 63, 67). These tests are often complementary (23, 52, 63, 67). The most useful tests are anorectal manometry, anal endosonography, balloon expulsion test and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (23, 52, 63, 67). A description of these tests and others that are commonly used for the evaluation of fecal incontinence and their clinical significance has been discussed in detail by Diamant et al. (67). Hence, a brief description of these tests and their clinical relevance is presented here with particular emphasis on recent literature and contentious issues. Anorectal Manometry and Sensory Testing Recommendation: Anorectal manometry with rectal sensory testing is the preferred method for defining the functional weakness of the external or internal anal sphincter and for detecting abnormal rectal sensation. Measurement of rectal compliance (reservoir function) may be helpful in some patients. These tests may also facilitate biofeedback training. Anorectal manometry provides an objective assessment of anal sphincter pressures together with an assessment of rectal sensation, rectoanal reflexes, and rectal compliance. Currently, several types of probes and pressure-recording devices are available. Each system has distinct advantages and drawbacks (63, 68, 69). A water-perfused probe with multiple closely spaced sensors is commonly used (63, 69). Alternatively, a solid-state probe with micro-transducers may be used (63, 69). Although more expensive and fragile, they do not require perfusion equipment, are easier to calibrate, and are possibly more accurate (63, 68). The anal sphincter pressures can be measured by stationary, station pull-through, or rapid pull-through techniques, but the former two are probably more accurate (63, 67, 68). A rapid pull-through technique can give falsely high sphincter pressures (67, 70). The resting anal sphincter pressure predominantly represents the internal anal sphincter function and the voluntary squeeze anal pressure predominantly measures the external anal sphincter function. Patients with incontinence have been shown to have low resting and low squeeze sphincter pressures (65, 71, 72). The duration of the sustained squeeze pressure provides an index of sphincter muscle fatigue. The ability of the external anal sphincter to contract in a reflex manner can also be assessed during abrupt increases of intraabdominal pressure such as when coughing (25, 63, 68, 69). This reflex response causes the anal sphincter pressure to rise above that of the rectal pressure to preserve continence. The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. In patients with spinal cord lesions above the conus medullaris, this reflex response is present but the voluntary squeeze may be absent, whereas in patients with lesions of the cauda equina or sacral plexus both the reflex response and the voluntary squeeze response are absent (63, 73, 75). The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. Sensory Testing Rectal balloon distention with either air or water can be used for the assessment of both the sensory responses and the compliance of the rectal wall. By distending a balloon in the rectum with incremental volumes, it is possible to assess the thresholds for first perception, a first desire or an urgent desire to defecate (25, 52, 63, 68, 69). A higher threshold for sensory perception suggests impaired rectal sensation (23, 25, 41, 52, 71). Also, the balloon volume required for partial or complete inhibition of anal sphincter tone can be assessed. It has been shown that the volume required to induce reflex anal relaxation was lower in incontinent patients than controls (71, 74). Because sampling of rectal contents by the anal mucosa may play an important role in maintaining continence (18, 19), quantitative assessment of anal perception using either electrical (22) or thermal (22, 76) stimulation has been advocated. In one study, anal mucosal sensation was assessed by recording perception threshold for electrical stimulation of the mid anal canal using a ring electrode (77). A combined sensory and motor defect was seen in patients with incontinence (77). In another study, although anal canal perception was impaired immediately after a vaginal delivery, there was no difference at 6 months (78). The role of thermosensitivity appears controversial (22). In one study, the ability of healthy anal mucosa to differentiate between small changes in temperature has been questioned (79). Hence, under normal conditions it is not possible to appreciate the temperature of fecal matter passing from the rectum to the anal canal during sampling (79). Whether patients have a pure sensory defect of anus without coexisting sphincter dysfunction or rectal sensory impairment has not been shown. In contrast, a combined sensory and motor defect has been reported in many studies (77, 78, 80). Rectal compliance can be calculated by assessing the changes in rectal pressure during balloon distention with air or fluid (41, 44, 52, 67, 68). The ratio dv/dp describes the relationship. Rectal compliance is reduced in patients with colitis (53, 54) and in patients with low spinal cord lesions and in diabetics with incontinence (41, 44, 52). In contrast, compliance is increased in high spinal cord lesion (42, 75). When performed meticulously, anorectal manometry can provide useful information regarding anorectal function (23, 52, 67, 80). A technical review recommended the use of anorectal manometry for the evaluation of patients with incontinence because it can define the functional weakness of one or both sphincters and helps to perform and evaluate the responses to biofeedback training (67). Unfortunately, to date there has been no uniform technique or equipment for performing anorectal manometry (81). Also, there is a dearth of normative data and uniform methods of interpreting test results. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop standards of testing anorectal function and to validate the significance of abnormal results. Recently, the American Motility Society has initiated an international collaborative effort to develop standards for manometry testing and a consensus document has been published (82). Such efforts may lead to standardization of testing and interpretation of anorectal manometry. Although there are insufficient data regarding normal values, overlap among healthy subjects and patients with incontinence (65, 67), and large confidence intervals in studies that have examined test reproducibility (64, 83), for the individual patient with incontinence, manometry testing can be very useful. Manometric tests of anorectal function may also be useful in assessing objective improvement following drug therapy (84), biofeedback therapy (85), or surgery (86). Imaging the Anal Canal Recommendation: Anal endosonography is the simplest, most widely available and least expensive test for defining structural defects of the anal sphincter and should be considered in patients with suspected fecal incontinence. ANAL ENDOSONOGRAPHY. Traditionally, anal endosonography has been performed using a 7 mHz rotating transducer with a focal length of 1–4 cm (87). It provides an assessment of the thickness and structural integrity of the external and internal anal sphincter muscle and can detect the presence of scarring, loss of muscle tissue, and other local pathology (87, 88). More recently, higher frequency (10–15 mHz) probes that provide better delineation of the sphincter complex have become available (89). After vaginal delivery, anal endosonography has revealed occult sphincter injury in 35% of primipara women and most of these lesions were not detected clinically (27). In another study, sphincter defects were detected in 85% of women with third-degree perineal tear compared with 33% of subjects without tears (28). In studies that compared EMG mapping with anal endosonography, there was a high concordance rate for identifying sphincter defects using both modalities (90, 91). The technique is, however, operator dependent and requires both training and experience (67). Although endosonography can distinguish an internal sphincter injury from that of an external sphincter injury, it has a low specificity for demonstrating the etiology of fecal incontinence (92). Because anal endosonography is more widely available, is less expensive, and is certainly less painful than needle insertion, currently, it is the preferred technique for examining the",

While some research has suggested men lacking in muscle may believe themselves to be sexually undesirable to women, little research has been done in this area, especially when compared to the strong literature connecting women’s drive for thinness to female sexual behavior. The present study sought to determine the connection between men’s body image and men’s perceived sexual efficacy and attractiveness. Male undergraduates (N = 105) completed a novel scale of sexual efficacy and attractiveness, in addition to questions relating to self-esteem, sexual behaviors and milestones, desire for muscle, and desire for thinness. Sexual efficacy and attractiveness was positively related to self-esteem, and mediated drive for muscle’s negative relationship to self-esteem. Drive for thinness was negatively related to self-esteem, but unrelated to any sexual indices. Results suggest the presence of two types of body image dissatisfaction in men—thinness and muscle—but only the culturally demanded body dimension impacts sexual variables.

Society defines which personal and physical traits are acceptable, and which are deviant for the general population. Today, persons with invisible stigmas, such as mental patients, escape the consequences of stigma as long as they keep the condition hidden from others. However for persons with visible stigmas like obesity, such escape is impossible. In the past, a round, robust body was an indication of wealth, but today, a person whose body is larger than acceptable suffers from stigmatization based on the visible trait.

      "title": "Moral status of the fetus: Fetal rights or maternal autonomy?",
      "abstract": "The moral status of the fetus bears special consideration, because it could come into conflict with a pregnant woman's right to decide what happens to her body. If this should occur, which should take precedence? There are three major ways of viewing the moral status of the fetus: that a fetus has the same rights as a live child; that a fetus has no rights; or that a fetus has increasing moral status with advancing gestation. If the fetus has full moral rights, the fetus is treated as a separate entity from the mother, and the pregnant woman as being effectively two patients. Because of the fetus's dependence, this potentially leads to serious conflict between maternal and fetal rights. The concept of a person's autonomy is one of choice. A person's right to autonomy is their right to choose how to live their own life. If a woman wishes to smoke tobacco, we would say she has the right to do so even if it harms her health. But smoking can also harm the fetus, albeit only to a relatively moderate extent. No society forbids women from smoking during pregnancy, although we might disapprove. Alcohol, however, and particularly binge drinking, can cause brain damage to the fetus. Cocaine can damage the blood supply to the fetal brain and cause intra-uterine stroke and fetal death. If the fetus has full rights, this could encourage legislation against maternal activities that might damage the fetus, such as excessive alcohol, or cocaine consumption. Indeed, in the USA, women who have damaged their babies through cocaine addiction have received lengthy prison sentences (12 years in one recent case). Assigning full rights to the fetus might infringe a mother's autonomy and is likely to lead to a coercive and punitive approach to pregnant women. It seems unjust for society to imprison a woman for accidentally killing her fetus through cocaine addiction, while permitting another woman to abort her viable fetus because it has Down syndrome. Another problem with maternal coercion is that there is no clear dividing line as to what is deemed harmful to the fetus. The degree of control of maternal diabetes is known to affect fetal outcome: should we force diabetic mothers to take their insulin? Religious beliefs can be over-ridden. A Jehovah's Witness adult's autonomy dictates that they can refuse a blood transfusion, but in the USA a pregnant mother who was a Jehovah's Witness and was bleeding was forced to have a transfusion to save her fetus.1 Mary Warren holds that a fetus has no moral status independent of its mother, but that the fetus acquires moral status at birth.2 When asked what the instant moral significance of birth is, she replies that infants, unlike fetuses, are part of a social world. It is emergence into the social world that confers the moral status. One implication of this position is that it would give a pregnant woman the moral right to abort a viable fetus, but not to kill her newborn infant. If she were to decide, late in pregnancy, that she did not want her (normal) baby, she could morally terminate the viable fetus, whereas if she were to go into labour and deliver the baby that day she could not, legally or morally, kill the newborn baby. There is a great difference, however, between an early abortion and a late termination of a viable fetus, which would have survived unless actively prevented from breathing. Feminists often act as if the fetus is an encumbrance, that it is only there to prey on the mother. The fetus has been likened to a parasite or even a tumour. Judith Jarvis Thomson uses a rather charming analogy of the fetus as a dying violinist: one night a woman is kidnapped and the violinist is plugged into her body to use her kidneys to extract toxins.3 Thomson also uses an even more touching analogy, in which she likens fetuses to people-seeds drifting about in the air. A woman might try to keep them out of her house, but one might accidentally land in the carpet and start to grow into a person-plant. However, later in the same article, Thomson also likens the fetus to a burglar.3 The attribution of malignant characteristics to the fetus is harsh. Making the fetus into the villain looks suspiciously like transferring blame or guilt for terminating a pregnancy. The third choice is that the fetus acquires increasing moral status with advancing gestation. The moral difference perceived by many between an early abortion and termination of a viable full-term fetus implies that we consider that the moral status of the fetus does indeed increase with gestation. If we assign the fetus full rights, then we are implying that society must guarantee those rights, as society does with a live baby. As already stated, however, the fetus's rights might conflict with the mother's autonomy to decide what happens to her own body. If the fetus has no rights, then even a viable fetus is unprotected if the mother jeopardizes its existence. If the moral status of the fetus increases with gestation, then a viable fetus has greater moral status than a newly fertilized ovum, and it might be reasonable to intervene if the mother's behaviour jeopardizes the fetus near term. The fetus is not a separate biological entity to the mother, but is totally dependent on her body until near term. This would seem to give the mother important 'rights' in deciding what happens to the fetus if it also affects what happens to her body. In general, there is little conflict. The mother is the fetus's moral guardian in a symbiotic, not a parasitic, relationship. If significant differences arise in the interests of the mother and fetus, the mother has a responsibility to consider the interests of both, and make an informed decision for both of them. If conflicts arise, the competent mother's rights to personal autonomy should prevail over the lesser rights of the fetus early in gestation, but as the fetus matures and acquires greater moral status, the situation becomes less clear-cut. What happens in current practice? The risk that the baby of an HIV-positive pregnant woman will catch HIV without intervention is approximately 25%. If the mother is given anti­retroviral drugs for the last few weeks of pregnancy, a Caesarean section is performed, the baby is given antiretroviral drugs and is bottle-fed, the risk falls to less than 5%. If a pregnant, HIV-positive woman who was well-informed and competent were to decline antiretroviral drugs or Caesarean section, should we allow the mother's autonomy to override the fetus's rights? A newborn baby who develops AIDS will die untreated, so if such a baby's mother declined treatment, normal practice would be to take the baby into care and give treatment. Societal protection of the newborn baby is sometimes necessary to prevent child neglect and child physical and sexual abuse, so it is hard to argue with this approach to the newborn with life-threatening HIV infection. If we allow the pregnant HIV-positive mother near term to refuse treatment, but not the mother of a live baby, we are behaving as if birth confers instant moral status. In the USA, an HIV-positive pregnant woman is felt to have a moral obligation to comply with antiretroviral drugs and Caesarean section, and this obligation has been prosecuted legally. A similar legal judgement, obliging an HIV-positive woman to have a Caesarean section and to bottle-feed, was made recently in Australia.4 In these legal judgements, the fetus's rights override the mother's autonomy. The problem is that the mother also has rights to decide what happens to her body. She might decide she does not want a Caesarean section, and prefer to take the increased risk that her baby will be HIV-infected. To deny her that right is to go against her autonomy. My personal view is that the interdependence between a pregnant woman and her fetus is a special relationship, which sometimes brings special ethical dilemmas. I prefer to live in a society that does not force a woman to undergo operations or behave against her own free will. Thus, I believe a pregnant woman's autonomy should always override the rights of her fetus, provided the woman is fully informed and is competent to make a decision. The only exceptions would be if the mother were incompetent, as a result of, for example, dementia or coma. My reason for this view is the importance of granting the mother's autonomy, and not because of Mary Warren's concept of the newborn baby's newly found societal relations. This will result in apparently anachronistic situations, such as in the HIV-positive pregnancy, where the baby acquires moral status miraculously at birth. But the alternative, of allowing the fetus's rights to carry more weight than the mother's autonomy, debases the concept of autonomy, and ignores the guardianship status of the mother for her fetus.",

      "abstract": "Groups of male and female Ss estimated the sizes of 10 body parts and of 3 non-body-object stimuli. They also provided ratings of their degree of satisfaction with 40 body parts and somatic characteristics. Women were found to overestimate body part sizes; men's judgments of body part sizes tended to be more veridical. No sex differences in size estimation tendencies were evident for non-body-object stimuli. Women tended to show less stability, i.e., higher average errors, of body part size estimations than men; this difference was not apparent on non-body-object size estimation responses. Body-part size estimation tendencies and non-body-object size estimation tendencies generally correlated about .40, a value high enough to suggest important common psychological processes, but not sufficiently great to alter the statistical conclusions. Scores on the body acceptance scale did not correlate significantly with size estimation tendencies. No difference in over-all level of body acceptance existed between sexes, but females had higher response-variabilities than males. Important sex differences seem to exist in body cognition. Men show greater veridicality of responses at the level of sensorily-mediated perception of the body. Women demonstrate a greater degree of differentiation among body parts and functions. Body-part size estimation responses appear to be sensitive to variations in the measurement conditions under which they are obtained; differences among the findings of independent researches may be a function of procedural dissimilarities. The presence or absence of visual stimulation appears to be an important factor which influences results.",

      "title": "Science and Faith to Understand Milk Bioactivity for Infants",
      "abstract": "Milk bioactivity refers to the specific health effects of milk components beyond nutrition. The science of milk bioactivity involves the systematic study of these components and their health effects, as verified by empirical data, controlled experiments, and logical arguments. Conversely, 'faith in milk bioactivity' can be defined as personal opinion, meaning, value, trust, and hope for health effects that are beyond investigation by natural, social, or human sciences. Faith can be strictly secular, but also influenced by spirituality or religion. The aim of this paper is to show that scientific knowledge is frequently supplemented with faith convictions to establish personal and public understanding of milk bioactivity. Mammalian milk is an immensely complex fluid containing myriad proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and micronutrients with multiple functions across species, genetics, ages, environments, and cultures. Human health includes not only physical health, but also social, mental, and spiritual health, requiring widely different fields of science to prove the relevance, safety, and efficacy of milk interventions. These complex relationships between milk feeding and health outcomes prevent firm conclusions based on science and logic alone. Current beliefs in and understanding of the value of breast milk, colostrum, infant formula, or isolated milk proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins, α-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, and growth factors) show that both science and faith contribute to understand, stimulate, or restrict the use of milk bioactivity. The benefits of breastfeeding for infants are beyond doubt, but the strong beliefs in its health effects rely not only on science, and mechanisms are unclear. Likewise, fear of, or trust in, infant formula may rely on both science and faith. Knowledge from science safeguards individuals and society against 'milk bioactivity superstition'. Conversely, wisdom from faith-based convictions may protect science from unrealistic 'milk bioactivity scientism'. Honesty and transparency about the potentials and limitations of both scientific knowledge and faith convictions are important when informing individuals and society about the nutritious and bioactive qualities of milk.",

      "abstract": "Multiple factors contribute to the development, maintenance and treatment of obesity. Viewing obesity through a gender relations approach helps to understand how an individual’s interactions with others and society contributes to health opportunities and constraints, resulting in excess body weight. In gender relations theory, the body is viewed as both an agent and a product of social practice, whereby lifestyle behaviours influenced by an individual’s context may impact on the physical body. This chapter presents life histories of two men in their 20s who have experience with obesity. Analysis of the production and power relations, relationships and symbolism reveal the marginalising effect of their obesity, and how gender interacts with other social structures including ethnicity and class. A holistic approach that considers how an individual configures their masculinity or femininity may assist in promoting and maintaining weight loss in obese individuals as it addresses the struggle in society experienced by many obese people.",

      "title": "Role of Stress on Women’s Health: Causes and Prevention",
      "abstract": "In recent years, stress has been the focus of intense research attention. Stress is a misfit between the demands of the environment and the individual’s abilities; the imbalance may be corrected, according to the situation, either by adjusting external demands to fit the individual or by strengthening the individual’s ability to cope or both. Everyone is exposed to stress, and a great number of people have experienced the traces of stress. Women are socialized to be the caretakers of others. More women than men have both a career outside the home and continue to try to juggle traditional responsibilities after hours. It has often been shown that women are the worriers and often do not make time to manage their health and take care of themselves. Stress is on the rise for women as they struggle to find a balance between their homes and careers. The recession has caused a greater need for women to work outside of the home to support their families. Health is a general condition of the body or mind with reference to soundness and vigor; it will be reflected by good or poor health. A poor health affects our mind, as a stressed life affects our health. The struggle that women confront each days trying to achieve the standards of being a daughter, women, wife, mother, house, and/ or career keeper puts us in a vulnerable position of presenting stress effects that may affect our health. And there are some preventive measures to cope with stress such as meditation, yoga, quality time etc.",

It was noted that the child’s early consumption of alcohol led to the formation of severe chronic pathology and a decrease in general immunity, which led to early mortality. It is indicated that insufficient, both quantitatively and qualitatively, nutrition, which also suffered from poor quality, led to the birth of children with genetic anomalies, as well as the formation of severe pathology in growing children, as well as the prevalence of infectious pathology in them. It has been proven that early marriages, widespread in the Middle Ages, led to pathology, both in young mothers, and high mortality in children born to them. Key words: Middle age, child, disease.",

Rational fear is related to the deterioration of health, loneliness, loss of loved ones and the decline of social status can be intensified by negative stereotypes about the elderly.

This argument was tested with a multivariate regression analysis utilizing data on 354 white men aged forty and older from the 1974 General Social Survey. The Srole anomia scale was used as the dependent variable. Multiple indicators of life chances and social participation were used; health and verbal intelligence were employed as controls. The results showed no relationship between age or other indicators of life chances and anomia, net of education and/or verbal intelligence. Prior studies reporting that age and anomia are causally related probably have done so due to lack of adequate control variables and/or due to cohort effects from the lesser education of the older population in the United States. Compared when employing appropriate controls, aged American males are not more anomic than middle-aged males.",

Health, illness, beliefs, knowledge, and medical practices are all influenced by culture, and dentistry is no exception. Everyone, whether rural or urban, has its own health and illness beliefs and practices. The only way to provide culturally sensitive health care is to be aware of, listen to, and be attentive to each patient, as well as to inquire about personal needs and wishes when appropriate. Spiritual well- being is regarded as the fourth dimension of health. It helps people realize their greatest potential, find meaning and purpose in life, and find fulfillment from within. The individual's lifestyle may have a significant impact on his or her oral health behaviour. Caries and plaque-induced periodontal illnesses are linked to personal hygiene, food intake frequency, motivation to preserve oral health, and in certain circumstances, religious commitment Dental myths are widespread and unquestioned misleading ideas that often arise as a result of a lack of education, spiritual beliefs, and traditional factors based on non-scientific information. Despite global advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, some people continue to hold on to their traditional values, practices, beliefs, and myths. If these myths are exposed in a timely manner, it may be possible to reduce the costs and time required for dental treatment, thereby converting an operative treatment into conservative dental management and improve patient satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Rational thinking and decision making are impacted when in a state of sexual arousal. The inability to self-regulate arousal can be linked to numerous problems, like sexual risk taking, infidelity, and sexual coercion. Studies have shown that most men are able to exert voluntary control over their sexual excitation with various levels of success. Both situational and dispositional factors can influence self-regulation achievement. The goal of this research was to investigate how ego depletion, a state of low self-control capacity, interacts with personality traits-propensities for sexual excitation and inhibition-and cognitive absorption, to cause sexual self-regulation failure. The sexual responses of 36 heterosexual males were assessed using penile plethysmography. They were asked to control their sexual arousal in two conditions, with and without ego depletion. Results suggest that ego depletion has opposite effects based on the trait sexual inhibition, as individuals moderately inhibited showed an increase in performance while highly inhibited ones showed a decrease. These results challenge the limited resource model of self-regulation and point to the importance of considering how people adapt to acute and high challenging conditions.",

We ask whether insights from addiction science and evolutionary biology may assist understanding and counteracting SES-related health disparities. It is known that a mismatch between evolved traits and behaviors that conserve energy drives many health deficits. We posit that this energy mismatch is one manifestation of a more expansive mismatch in levels of reward activation, between environments more versus less manipulated by human activity. This larger mismatch explains why SES-related health disparities arise not only from overeating and excessive sedentism, but also from alcohol, nicotine, other substances, and mood disorders. Lower SES persons are more likely to have lower baseline reward activation, which leads to higher prioritization of reward elevating activities, and at the same time are less likely to act on knowledge about unhealthfulness of behaviors.",

But adults also apply such expressions to certain sociomoral transgressions, such as cheating on one's spouse or stealing from the poor. Here, the authors explore whether young children associate disgust with physical and moral events by endorsing either verbal or facial expressions of disgust. Results indicate that children in Grades K, 2, and 4 (N = 167) label moral violations \"disgusting\" more often than nondisgusting physical acts or neutral negative acts but less often than physically disgusting acts. Likewise, children associate facial expressions of disgust with moral violations. These findings are discussed in the context of different theories about the relationship between physical disgust and moral disgust.",

Within-person variation in authentic pride was normally-distributed across people and days whereas the other emotions were burst-like and characterized by zero-inflated, negative binomial distributions. Perceiving social interactions as generally communal increased the odds of hubristic pride activation and reduced the odds of guilt activation; daily communal behavior reduced guilt intensity.

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the few certainties in life is that once you are born, you are bound to die. This certainty does not make death a welcome thought, however. Thus, the most common response to the thought of one's death, or the death of other loved ones, is fear. Some researchers on this topic have suggested that the fear of death is a major motivator of much behavior, and can influence such behavior in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, this viewpoint suggests that people who are afraid of dying tend to do whatever it takes to ensure that they stay alive. Staying alive contributes to the continuity and socialization of the species because people so driven are more likely to want to have children and to raise them according to their society's acceptable standards. However, the same death anxiety can become a destructive force and could even result in both physical and mental problems. High levels of death anxiety in older adults are associated with lower ego integrity and more physical and psychological problems relative to individuals with low death anxiety. Death anxiety is a multifaceted construct that is difficult to define but has been conceptualized to include: fear of death of oneself; fear of death of others; fear of dying of self; and fear of the dying of others.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sexuality is an important component of physical, intellectual, psychologic and social well-being. This central role of sexuality in a person's life is affected by health or illness and by many psychologic factors. Physicians have the opportunity to assess the sexual function in the course of routine history taking; however, this is rarely done. Additionally, many doctors are uncomfortable with the patient's questions about sexuality and feel uneasy about broaching the subject themselves. In some cases, they feel that such questions are an intrusion on the patient's privacy, even though they realize that bowel and drug habits, cigarette and alcohol use and reproductive status are also private matters. In other cases, they believe that the patient's sexual concerns are not of medical significance or that their own ability to treat such concerns is limited. In this way, they ignore or dismiss the patient's concerns.",

Las decisiones que están asociadas al desarrollo sexual adolescente, tienen a menudo importantes implicancias para la salud y la educación, así como para las relaciones actuales y futuras. La mayoría de los jóvenes inicia su vida sexual en la adolescencia, logra evitar embarazos no deseados e infecciones de transmisión sexual y desarrolla relaciones saludables respetuosas y comprometidas. Sin embargo, comparados a otros grupos de edad, los adolescentes tienen tasas desproporcionadamente altas de morbilidades derivadas de la conducta, incluyendo infecciones de transmisión sexual y embarazos no deseados. Los jóvenes que no adscriben a las normas socioculturales de expresión sexual y de género, tienen riesgos adicionales para su salud física, emocional y social. Los clínicos que atienden adolescentes necesitan saber sobre el desarrollo general y psicosexual del adolescente, las tendencias que rodean sus conductas sexuales, los beneficios y riesgos que acompañan a estas conductas y los recursos y las intervenciones que están disponibles. La información que ofrezcan debe ser precisa, completa y libre de prejuicios, para que puedan tomar decisiones saludables y seguras. Sexuality is an aspect of identity, and healthy sexual development is an important goal of adolescence. Decisions that are associated with adolescent sexual development often have important implications for health and education, as well as for current and future relationships. Most young people initiate sexual activity in adolescence, prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections and develop respectful and healthy relationships. However, compared to other age groups, teens have disproportionately high rates of morbidity resulting from behavior, including sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies. Youth who do not ascribe to the cultural norms of sexual expression and gender have additional risks to their physical, emotional and social health. Clinicians need to know about adolescent general and psychosexual development, trends surrounding their sexual behaviors, benefits and risks associated with these behaviors, and resources and interventions that are available. The information they provide must be accurate, complete, and unbiased, so teens can make healthy and safe decisions.",

      "abstract": "The vast bulk of the discourse surrounding reproduction is centered on women. Yet, the rate of childlessness in the United Kingdom (and much of the world) is higher among men. Recently, there has been an increased focus on fatherhood and fathering in academia, policy, practice, and the general media. However, data on men who do not become fathers has been excluded and their experiences minimized and dismissed. Infertility research has shown that failure to achieve the high social status of parenthood has the similar effects on mental and physical health as a diagnosis of life-threatening illness. In this chapter, I will draw on two qualitative research studies to show how not achieving the pronatalist ideal of parenthood impacts on men's identity, sense of self, behaviors, health and well-being and social networks across the life course. The workplace is an arena where people who do not fit socio-cultural norms and expectations are overtly and/or covertly stigmatized and discriminated against through policy, working practices and everyday interaction between groups and individuals. I will argue that failing to acknowledge men's experience of non-reproduction has a significant impact on both individuals and institutions alike.",

The course of growth is also influenced by the timing of puberty. An advance in the age of puberty tends to increase the size of young children, thereby exaggerating any secular trend to an increase of size among the prepubertal segment of a population. But because of earlier epiphyseal closure, an advance of puberty may also limit adult dimensions. Other factors such as increasing kyphosis, the compression of intervertebral discs, osteoporosis and vertebral collapse lead to a progressive decrease in an individual's stature over the span of adult life. These factors, again, may have some inherited component, but are certainly susceptible also to changes of personal environment.",

It was hypothesized that religiosity and belief in life after death would play different roles for younger and older adults regarding bereavement adjustment. Sample characteristics suggested that the interaction effect between age and religiosity or age and belief in life after death on bereavement adjustment could not be tested. However, aspects of bereavement adjustment, in particular physical health and efforts to cope, were found to be influenced by age, religiosity, and cause of death.

Religiousness has generally correlated with improved overall physical and mental health outcomes. Furthermore, religion and spirituality are sources of support and coping for many people. But religiousness can sometimes have negative influences such as in the case of cults or terrorism.

      "title": "Catch-Up Growth during Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Various chronic diseases and malnutrition cause growth failure in childhood and adolescence; following recovery, catch-up growth may occur. The extent to which growth failure can be compensated for depends on the timing, severity and duration of the growth failure, as well as on the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease restricting growth and development. There are three types of catch-up growth. In type 1, when growth restriction ceases, growth occurs to such an extent that the height deficit is rapidly eliminated. Once the original growth curve is attained, growth proceeds normally. In type 2, when growth restriction ceases, there is a delay in growth and somatic development. However, growth continues for longer than usual, compensating for the growth arrest. Type 3 is a mixture of types 1 and 2, and all three types may be complete or incomplete. Two factors make it difficult to record catch-up growth during adolescence: the large variability in timing, expression and duration of pubertal growth and somatic development, and the relationship between the measurement error and the increase in growth observed within a defined time period. To avoid data collection and analysis problems, prospective and long-term study design should be considered. Ideally, data collection should be started in the prepubertal period and continue until final adult height is reached. High technical standards and well-trained personnel should be used. A variety of parameters should be assessed to obtain different dimensions of the growth process and pubertal development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This alteration in the testosterone-estrogen ratio can lead to feminization and sexual dysfunction. Research on the effects of alcoholism in women is less definitive; but nonetheless, points to alterations in sexual functioning as well. For the non-alcoholic, acute intoxication leads to a complex interplay of physiological, psychological and social expectations which make it difficult to predict the effect of alcohol on sexual behavior. The general concensus of the experimental evidence on alcohol's impact on sexual behavior is that is is a depressant even at low concentrations. Although sexual responsiveness is often attributed to the influence of alcohol (disinhibition theory), it appears the circumstances under which it is consumed, and the psychological state of the consumer, is as important a determinant of sexual behavior.",

Indeed most of the work on growth in international centres has been left to the endocrinologist who may or may not be informed concerning nutrition and indeed may have no experience in the realm of body composition — so necessary in the assessment of tissue growth. Even in units devoted to anthropometry, linear growth and the consideration of weight for age, awareness has not always been apparent concerning the great potential of laboratory methods. Such methods greatly augment relevant information. In the clinic, the measurement of body length, weight and bone age are important for the assessment of growth and represent the initial approach. However as pointed out years ago change in body size for age can produce psychological changes in the child (Drash, Greenberg and Money, 1968). The dwarf pictures his peers as giants while the obese adolescent considers that he is twice his actual size and has hidden feelings of guilt regarding how society views him (or her).

      "title": "Editorial: Controlling ourselves: insights into the development of psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Controlling yourself is far more easily said than done. It takes years of experience and biological maturation to even acquire the basic skills to get it right, and there is no simple formula for getting from infancy to adulthood with good self-regulation skills in place. It is a very complex business, involving opportunities and pitfalls along the way. Yet the establishment of self-regulation is arguably one of the most dramatic markers of healthy development. From early in life, the brain develops in tandem with changing social influences, resulting in typical and healthy cognitive, sensory-motor and social-emotional functioning. Yet the presence of a host of biological and environmental risks sometimes disrupts this developmental course. These disruptions are in part responsible for the emergence of a wide range of symptoms arising from mental and behavioral disorders. Although adolescents and especially children (when compared to adults) are still developing their self-regulation skills, they are much like adults in the extent of individual differences in their underlying self-regulatory capacities. Similarly, different disorders show distinct patterns of self-regulatory deficits or adaptations. This variation is expressed at many levels, from neural activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems, to modulation of visual attention, to control of cognitive or emotional events, to broad and easily observed behaviors. Understanding these variations - within and between the different levels of brain, cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity - will yield important insights into the nature and consequences of psychopathology, and provide better roadmaps to new interventions and improvements in existing treatments (Posner & Rothbart, 2007). In their annotation, Banaschewski and Brandeis provide many examples of research that is providing new methods for studying the development of childhood disorders. Their review emphasizes the strengths and limitations of using measures of electrophysiology to test for individual and disorder-group differences in brain activation patterns that reflect the real-time processing of information and the control and regulation of those processes. This methodology and field of research is maturing rapidly, and promises to yield powerful information regarding etiology of disorders and effects of intervention, especially when coupled with traditional behavioral assessments of symptoms. Investigation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity – our body's first response to danger or stress - opens another window into the developing self-regulatory capacity of children and adolescents and its role in psychopathology. Using skin conductance reactivity as a measure of SNS functionality, Cummings and colleagues found that the effects of paternal and maternal depressive symptoms on children's developing behavioral and emotional problems were dependent on the degree of children's SNS reactivity, with highly reactive children showing the strongest effects. Accordingly, practitioners should be aware of risks to healthy self-regulation arising from fathers’ as well as mothers’ depressive symptoms. Moreover, some children may be more vulnerable than others, depending on their stable physiological responses – and poor regulation of those responses – to stressors and particular family contexts (e.g. paternal depression). These findings point to the importance of considering children's reactivity to stress as well as the broader family environment in determining directions for assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Moving from the analysis of SNS functioning to behavioral measures of cognitive control, Hardin and colleagues examined the role of incentives (money in this case) in influencing adolescents’ and adults’ performance in a visual attention task. They compared the youth and adults, as well as sub-groups of youth with anxiety or depression, and found evidence of developmental and diagnostic group differences in the degree of cognitive control and sensitivity to reward, as they related to improvements in performance. Anxious and depressed adolescents showed impaired regulation of eye movements during the task, as well as a dampened response to incentives, compared to the healthy adolescents and adults. If replicated, these results have important implications for the way in which clinicians utilize and evaluate the use of incentives for improving treatment outcomes with mood and anxiety disordered youth - particularly in light of the predominance of cognitive-based therapies for these disorders. Another example of dysfunctional self-regulation can be seen in the comorbidity of ADHD and reading disability. The paper by Bental and Tirosh highlights the need to measure attention and executive functions in youth who show evidence of reading disorder, as well as the assessment of working memory and information processing speed (i.e. rapid naming of objects or numbers) when considering ADHD symptomatology. Their study of Hebrew-speaking children and young adolescents revealed that the co-diagnosis of reading disorder and ADHD is predicted by the combination of slow processing speed and poor working memory, and also points to the importance of attention regulation to reading performance and efficiency. A similar lesson can be learned by reading Reiersen and colleagues’ paper on the connections between ADHD diagnosis and autistic symptoms in childhood and adolescence. The presentation of autistic symptoms in some children with ADHD previously has been noted by clinicians, but as these researchers emphasize in their paper most diagnostic taxonomies (including DSM-IV) do not permit co-diagnosis of ADHD and pervasive developmental disorder. Reiersen and colleagues have confirmed the presence of severe autistic behaviors in many children with ADHD in a twin sample derived from population-wide birth records. Clinically significant levels of autistic traits were most common among youth with a combined type ADHD diagnosis. These findings reinforce the importance of assessing and treating severe disruptions in social responsiveness and related social impairments in children with ADHD. So what do clinicians and other practitioners gain by adding to their ‘‘toolbox’’ a bio-behavioral framework, when considering the role of dysfunctional self-regulation in the development of disorders? As is evident in these papers, there is some potential in the underlying theories and methodologies used in this work for determining brain-behavior mechanisms - and doing so with much greater precision than has been allowed in the past. For example, clinicians want to know whether the treatments they are utilizing result in meaningful and lasting improvements in functioning. But within any group of youth (for any disorder in question), there is almost always a wide range in response to treatment and long-term progress following intervention. With more proximal and precise measures of the underlying brain mechanisms involved in self-regulation of cognitions, emotions and behavior – as well as a more thorough understanding of how these bio-mechanisms transact with the social environment – change in these bio-social processes can be studied. My prediction is that in the not too distant future, we will be able to use these tools to measure change in regulation and symptoms at multiple levels of analysis (e.g. brain activation, working memory, observed behavior), and also will be equipped with a precision of measurement and specificity of theory that will allow us to designate sub-groups of individuals who are most or least likely to respond well to readily available treatment options. Readers of JCPP are exposed to a broad range of topics presented within excellent theoretical and empirical studies, and the current issue is no exception. The studies described above are complemented by other outstanding papers addressing contexts, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders and symptom profiles, ranging from autism to conduct problems to somatic problems.",

      "title": "Sexual Paraphilia",
      "abstract": "Human beings are inherently sexual in nature. An individual's sexual behaviour can have a profound impact on the person's sexuality regardless of how this behaviour occurs, be it masturbation in isolation or penetrative intercourse with a partner. Sex per say is not always done with an aim for procreation [1]. The individual's propensity for sex can be both procreative and non-procreative. The degree of inclination and the extent of engagement in the act though will depend on the individual's society, his/her culture, upbringing, religious beliefs/taboos, other people's expectation and opportunities [2]. What constitutes a normal sexual behaviour? There is no straightforward answer. What may be normal in one culture/society may be abnormal in another. The definition of 'normalcy' is driven by society and/or cultural values, and the extent of 'deviance' is also influenced by the same. Furthermore the 'degree of deviance' in some sexual behaviours can be quantified by comparing with already established norms, but this is not possible for all sex-related behaviours and conditions [3].",

      "abstract": "The etiology of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) involves many variables that influence its onset, duration, and severity; and it is well known that its occurrence has health implications for the offspring. This review focuses on psychological and psychosocial factors as influences on NVP (“morning sickness”), including cultural, social, and associative variables. Certain foods are more likely to result in NVP than others, and this often stems from women’s experiential history with those food substances, including the potential to form associative-based aversions. Moreover, acknowledging the role of associative factors could influence the magnitude of NVP. Many demographic variables (e.g., geographical regions, age, socio-economic status) are related to NVP, but whether a population has more women with NVP may be due to certain foods being more common or rare in the diet of that population, as predicted by theories of associative processes. Consideration of the role of associative processes on NVP has implications for understanding its cause and magnitude. Also, mood and poorer psychological adjustment can exacerbate NVP. Issues related to management or treatment of the disorder are reviewed.",

      "title": "IS THE HUMAN PERSONALITY MORE PLASTIC IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD?",
      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

      "abstract": "In a context of ageing human population, the question of the elderly people's sexuality, a recent phenomenon, remains without precise and obvious answer. Still, the sexuality of the older person must be viewed as the continuation of the adult's sexuality. However, it is partially or completely, depending on gender, dissociated from the concept of reproduction. Partly for this functional reason, the society estimates that the elderly person cannot feel sexual desire, are not physically attractive, therefore not desirable. Even if they felt sexual need, they would be physiologically unable. Sexuality is an integral part of the quality of life, well-being, and undoubtedly of the person's health whatever their age. It is thus important to deal with this matter from a physiological and biological point of view. Sexuality and deteriorations related to the process of ageing have to be taken into consideration. These deteriorations are not automatically linked to the increase in longevity. It is in the responsibility of health workers, professionally in charge of the elderly people, to help them better understand their desires which lies in a framework of normality. A greater knowledge of their sexuality will fight the current repression of the sexuality of the elder ones.",

      "abstract": "All over the world young people are stigmatised and discriminated against in relation to their sexual and reproductive health. Stigma discrimination and the violation of human rights are intimately connected reinforcing and legitimising each other. Their manifestations are varied occurring in families and communities in health services at places of work and in schools. Across a range of settings young people may be stigmatised and discriminated against for being sexually active before marriage or for engaging in forms of sexuality which are considered by their communities and wider society to be non-normative such as homosexual or transgendered practices. In addition in settings where premarital sexual activity among young people is stigmatised the signs of unprotected sexual activity such as unplanned pregnancy having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or being HIV-positive may themselves be highly stigmatised. This may seriously limit access to good quality sexual and reproductive health services. This stigmatisation of young people’s sexuality and sexual behaviour has serious consequences. In particular it can lead to young people feeling that they have to conceal their sexual activity from significant adults in their lives including parents teachers and health workers. The secrecy and shame that stigma often brings can deny young people access to the resources they need in order to make and implement informed decisions about their sexuality and sexual health. Where resources are available - or inappropriately framed - they may be inadequate to address young people’s needs. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "Sexuality remains important throughout a person's life, but sexual behavior does not receive the same levels of acceptance at all ages. Older people are challenged by ageist attitudes and perceptions that hinder their sexual expression. They are stereotyped as non-sexual beings who should not, cannot, and do not want to have sexual relationships. Expressing sexuality or engaging in sexual activity in later life is considered by many in society as immoral or perverted. False expectations for older people also stem from ideals of beauty, centralization of the biomedical perspective on sexuality of older adults, and the association of sex with reproduction. Unfortunately, older people internalize many ageist attitudes towards sexuality in later life and become less interested in sex and less sexually active. The following chapter explores attitudes towards sexuality in later life among the media, young people, older people themselves, and care providers. In order to enable older people to express their sexuality and sexual identity freely and fully, awareness of ageist perceptions must be raised and defeated.",

      "title": "Sleep patterns and high blood pressure",
      "abstract": "How many hours of sleep are needed to stay in good health? This frequent and still partly unresolved question has become an important social issue. This is because modern lifestyle contributes to a growing trend of reduced sleep duration, especially on weekdays, leading to chronic sleep deprivation [1]. Sleep requirements constitute a continuum and are normally distributed in the general population. The amount of sleep we need depends on various factors. Age and sex are important determinants, but we should not forget specific conditions such as pregnancy and previous sleep deprivation. Also, quality of sleep is significantly related to the number of sleep hours required for an effective nocturnal rest. However, the length of sleep needed in a given person is also an individual feature, probably with a genetic background. In fact, the individual sleep pattern is already evident in childhood and tends to persist throughout a person's life [2–4]. Whereas most normal adults typically require 7–8 h of sleep every 24 h for well being, some individuals may need more or less sleep time to avoid experiencing daytime somnolence and/or impairment in daytime performance. Another reason for which the optimal sleep duration is not a universal number is the fact that it is determined by two different factors: a person's basal sleep need (i.e. the amount of sleep one needs on a regular basis for optimal daytime performance), and person's sleep debt (i.e. the accumulated deficit of sleep time due to poor sleep habits in previous days, related to a number of pathologic conditions, shift work and need of afterhours work or awakenings due to environmental interferences). Given these complex mechanisms, the impact of sleep on health-related outcomes is, thus, determined by the individual interaction between basal sleep need and sleep debt, more than by just the absolute sleep duration. In recent years, the evaluation of individual sleep patterns has gained considerable interest due to the growing evidence of the relevance of sleep features in the context of cardiovascular and metabolic alterations. More specifically, a number of studies have suggested that short (<7 h) sleep duration is associated with an increased prevalence of arterial hypertension [5–8], particularly when combined with subjective insomnia [9]. These cross-sectional observations were extended by the finding of increased risk of developing hypertension in middle-aged short sleepers in longitudinal studies [8,10,11]. Moreover, as recently summarized by Cappuccio et al. in two meta-analyses, sleep duration appears to directly and indirectly predict cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Interestingly, in these meta-analyses the observed relationship between sleep duration and outcome was U-shaped, both too long and too short sleep duration being associated with worse prognosis [12,13]. The article by Faraut et al. published in the current issue of Journal of Hypertension[14] provides further evidence in this field by addressing the association between hypertension and sleep duration in patients referring to primary care physicians in the frame of a cross-sectional survey, which included about 1000 participants. The principal finding of this study is that sleeping 5 h or less was independently associated with higher prevalence of hypertension, the point estimate of odds ratio being 1.8 compared with a reference group sleeping 7 h. This finding largely confirms the results obtained in previous studies. Moreover, the study by Faraut et al.[14] has the obvious limitation of any cross-sectional analysis, that is the inherent inability to demonstrate the causal nature of such relationship. Another limitation of this study is that sleep duration was self-assessed, with no information on the time window over which sleep patterns were explored. Although self-assessment of sleep was used in previous studies, this approach certainly does not guarantee a precise assessment of mechanisms linking short sleep with hypertension [15]. In fact, insomnia or sleep deprivation is variably assessed by history of symptoms in the preceding weeks, months or years, thus including in the analysis the duration of sleep characterizing both occasional as well as chronic insomnia patients. Finally, definition of hypertension was based on conventional blood pressure (BP) measurements only, without any assessment of out-of-office BP levels and particularly of nocturnal BP [16]. Notwithstanding the above limitations, some features of this study make it somewhat different compared with previous reports. The study was performed in a primary care setting, so that its results apply to the real life situation in which a large proportion of hypertensive patients are handled. This has allowed the authors to collect information on a large number of variables, including a number of clinical, lifestyle and psychosocial factors, which might be involved in mediating the observed relationship. This clearly reinforces the validity of the main findings of the study. Particularly, such an approach has allowed the authors to assess the possible role of depression and anxiety in this context [14]. In fact, their data indicate that the association of these psychological traits with hypertension might be mediated by the fact that sleep duration (and possibly also sleep quality) is altered in persons with anxiety and depression in line with what reported previously [17]. Although this article adds to the available literature emphasizing the impact of short sleep duration on cardiovascular risk, many aspects of this complex relation still need to be clarified, also because of a number of limitations of the available studies on this issue (Table 1). On one hand, the mechanisms linking the two phenomena remain largely unexplored. Among the responsible factors for the adverse consequences of short sleep, an increased sympathetic activity might play a pivotal role, also through its well known effects on BP and heart rate variability, including the enhancement of short lasting BP fluctuations and the blunting of day–night BP fall. This autonomic derangement might be both a fundamental determinant of the cardiovascular complications of short sleep, but at the same time, being associated with a hyperarousal state, it might also be one of the reasons for sleep alterations in the frame of a closed loop interaction [18]. Exploring the mechanisms behind the link between short sleep duration and hypertension is not just of academic interest, however, because the identification of underlying pathophysiological processes may allow the development and implementation of strategies aimed at reducing the risks of too short (or too long) sleep. On the other hand, more information is needed on specific features characterizing sleep quality and effectiveness, which may be more directly related to cardiovascular outcomes than sleep duration by itself.TABLE 1: Limitations of available studies on the relation between sleep duration and hypertensionACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Conflicts of interest None declared.",

In a person's life, the three phases of adulthood (early, middle, and late adulthood) are examined to study how religiousness changes during the transition from middle to late adulthood, and this requires special attention. Americans turn to religion increasingly as they age in order to deal with the challenges associated with old age: health problems, spousal bereavement, death anxiety, and the lack of purposefulness that may characterize the postretirement period. The findings of the study presented in this chapter indicate that religiousness increases from late middle to late adulthood. The study participants increased in religiousness from their fifties to their seventies and did so irrespective of whether they were men or women, or whether they came from a mainline Protestant, nonmainline Protestant, or Catholic family background. However, the gradient of increase in religiousness among the aging participants was not very steep.",

Not only is income associated with better health, but wealth affects health as well. Though it is easy to imagine how health is tied to income for the very poor or the very rich, the relationship between income and health is a gradient: discrepancies exist at every level of the economic ladder. Middle-class Americans are healthier than those living in or near poverty, but they are less healthy than the upper class.",

      "title": "The effects of inbreeding, crossbreeding and stress on metabolic rate in Drosophila littoralis",
      "abstract": "Fitness of an individual is commonly measured through the number and quality of offspring. Fitness is, however, the final outcome of all physiological and developmental processes and thus connected also to other features than reproduction, for example to metabolic rate. There are two opposite views about the connection between metabolic rate and quality: according to resource allocation theory low metabolic rate is a sign of high individual quality when the opposite view states low metabolic rate is connected to low ability to obtain resources which further leads to poor quality and fitness. Genetic differences between individuals lead also to differences in fitness. Inbreeding increases these genetic differences by increasing the amount of homozygosity. This leads to decreased fitness when possible deleterious effects of recessive alleles become visible in a homozygous state in fitness-related traits. Because of this effect, commonly known as inbreeding depression, inbred individuals have lower fitness compared to that of outbred individuals. Crossbreeding may cancel out the effects of inbreeding as it results to increased heterozygosity and thus possibly to higher fitness compared to the inbred parents. Added to the internal stress caused by inbreeding, also external factors such as drought and various chemicals can cause stress to the organism. Internal and external stressors may also have interactions, so that inbred individuals suffer more from external stress than outbred individuals. My goal in this study was to specify the connection between fitness and metabolic rate by manipulating the quality of the Drosophila littoralis flies through inbreeding, crossbreeding and salt stress. There were less offspring in inbred families and the body mass of the measured females was lower than in crossbred or base population flies. Thus inbreeding had lowered the fitness of the flies when measured with commonly known fitness traits. Inbred females had lower metabolic rate than that of crossbred females. Based on this, the low metabolic rate of inbred flies observed supports the theory of low total amount of resources indicating poor fitness. Like expected, crossbreeding returned the lowered fitness back to the level of the base population with all fitness measures. Salt stress did not have an effect on metabolic rate alone nor were there interactions between breeding treatment and salt stress in any measured character.",

At an early age, these role reversals are often discouraged—girls and boys may be verbally or physically bullied when they don't conform to what other children (and adults) think they should play with. Parental permission must be secured, and in some instances, a parent or guardian may be required to be with the child during the experiment. Another consideration is realizing the natural limitations of children (in terms of boredom, fatigue, energy level, etc.). Hormones may affect toy choices indirectly, perhaps through an influence on activity level, motor skills, abilities, or temperament. Further, natural variations in levels or availability of testosterone among normal males and females might contribute to individual differences in sex-typed behavior.",

Ageism directed at older people is prevalent; over 90% of older people in the United States report that they regularly experience ageism, such as when others assume they are forgetful or need assistance because of their age. Experiencing ageism is associated with poorer health outcomes, reduced cognitive performance, and increased healthcare costs. Reducing ageism requires a multifaceted approach, including strengthening anti-ageism laws and reframing societal narratives about what it means to grow older. Growing older should not be presented as a problem but as a fundamental part of the human journey. Ageism can also be reduced through positive intergenerational interactions and educational initiatives. Reducing ageism can promote healthier aging trajectories.",

Yet some might also see this relationship in energetic terms: as exciting, lively, passionate, or fun. An online survey asked 871 U.S. adults who believed in God to reflect on a recent positive life event. Three measures assessed relational energy or excitement: a slider item, a Likert item, and a set of eight adjectives. Regressions consistently showed that even when controlling for perceived love and safety in the relationship, this energy/excitement dimension predicted more gratitude to God, more divine attributions and gift appraisals for the event, feeling more loved by God, and greater desires to pass on kindness to others. The predictive role of energy/excitement was not reducible to religiousness, God belief, state or trait gratitude, trait gratitude to God, feeling energized, subjective vitality, or social desirability.",

      "abstract": "I was happy to see your Special Issue on Obesity ([7 Feb.][1]), yet I felt there was too little attention paid to the emotional and psychological factors behind obesity and the poor relationship Americans seem to have with food. In her Editorial “The ironic politics of obesity” (p. [781][2]), Marion Nestle writes, “Overweight comes from consuming more food energy than is expended in activity.” Yes, but where does this desire, or need, to consume more food come from in the first place? I do not doubt the role played by genetics, evolution, and physiology in obesity. Yet there are many high school students (particularly female ones) who can point to food as their primary mechanism for coping with academic and social pressures, and many eating disorder survivors who can tell you that their misuse of food was deeply rooted in perfectionism, insecurity, and low self-esteem. Anorexia, bulimia, and obesity are extremes along the continuum of Americans' poor relationship with food. While some Americans are getting fatter, others are starving to death by their own volition. An anorexic or severely obese 12-year-old girl is not a victim of evolution, but an artifact of our society. The prevalence of eating disorders in young people should alarm those interested in obesity and inspire them to look deeper at the underlying psychological and emotional issues that food can seem to soothe.\n\nInstead of a tax on “junk” food, as Nestle advocates, I think we need greater attention paid to the issues stressing out our nation's youth and more energy devoted to helping them cope in ways other than purging, bingeing, or some combination of both. Every year, the cigarette tax rises, yet more and more teenage girls turn to cigarettes to “relieve stress.” A tax or other restrictions to the food supply are not going to solve the obesity and eating-disorder problems. We need a solid understanding of where the demand comes from and efforts to help young people see that there are alternatives to over- or underuse of food in times of stress.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.299.5608.845\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.299.5608.781",

      "abstract": "Body image disturbance – a cause of distress amongst the general population and those diagnosed with various disorders – is often attributed to the media’s unrealistic depiction of ideal bodies. These ideals are strongly gendered, leading to pronounced fat concern amongst females, and a male preoccupation with muscularity. Recent research suggests that visual aftereffects may be fundamental to the misperception of body fat and muscle mass – the perceptual component of body image disturbance. This study sought to establish the influence of gender on these body aftereffects. Male and female observers were randomly assigned to one of four adaptation conditions (low fat, high fat, low muscle, and high muscle bodies) and were asked to adjust the apparent fat and muscle levels of male and female bodies to make them appear as ‘normal’ as possible both before and after adaptation. While neither the gender of observers or of body stimuli had a direct effect, aftereffect magnitude was significantly larger when observers viewed own-gender (compared to other-gender) stimuli. This effect, which may be due to attentional factors, could have implications for the development of body image disturbance, given the preponderance of idealised own-gender bodies in media marketed to male and female consumers.",

The relationship between the definition of a person and the ascription of autonomy is a somewhat circular one. To be a person is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the ascription of autonomy; no-one seriously suggests that animals possess autonomy. Ageing need not necessarily is detrimental to autonomy; indeed, at some stages in life, it is a prerequisite for it. Ageing is not simply a matter of chronology; there is also an element of social construction involved in the concept. Certainly the physiological deterioration that generally accompanies ageing in various degrees is very real and it may result in the elderly becoming less able to care for themselves and consequently more dependent on others. Ageing may certainly result in limitations in oneself, for physiological performance declines with age.",

Individual, relational, and network characteristics that influence network instability in the absence of a significant life transition/crisis are less understood. We focus on those ties that transition from active to dormant. Because the shift to dormancy is often interpreted as a reduction in support or social capital, it is considered problematic. This study is based on longitudinal survey data of middle‐class adults who did not undergo life changes. Even in this context of relative stability, support networks experience rates of dormancy similar to those observed during periods of major upheaval. Tie dormancy is unrelated to individual characteristics, network size and density, or homophily along dimensions other than sex. Frequency and medium of communication are particularly notable as factors that were not related to tie dormancy. Ties were less likely to become dormant if they were geographically or emotionally close, immediate kin or neighbors, highly supportive, the same sex, or more embedded in the network. These findings provide context for how support networks operate when not buffeted by exogenous forces. They provide a baseline for understanding the impact on networks of transitions, trauma, new media, and difficult life circumstances.",

We provide a large-scale test of this hypothesis for the human male and show that with cross-national and cross-generational improvements in living conditions, where environmental stressors recede, men’s gains in height and weight are more than double those of women’s, increasing sexual size dimorphism. Our study combines evolutionary biology with measures of human wellbeing, providing novel insights into how socio-ecological factors and sexual selection shape key physical traits.",

      "title": "The relationship between perfectionism, eating disorders and athletes: a review.",
      "abstract": "Perfectionism is a potentially maladaptive personality trait implicated in a number of psychopathologies. As our understanding of the construct perfectionism has shifted from more unidimensionally focused conceptualizations to multidimensional ones, our ability to assess its bearing on various disorders has grown. One particular area in which perfectionism appears to play an important role is among eating disorder patients. The personalities of both those with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are thought to be intrinsically perfectionistic, which suggests a need to understand the role perfectionism plays in the development, course and outcome of these disorders. There is also an increased focus on perfectionism among athletes and its relationship to the higher prevalence of eating disorders in this group. With the institution of Title IX in the United States (which prohibited sex discrimination in higher educational settings) the participation of women in various sports has increased exponentially and with it concerns about their well-being in a milieu where a risk for menstrual irregularities, osteoporosis and eating disorders (the female athlete triad) are common. However, conflicting data suggests that athletics may be a protective factor in the development of eating disorders on the one hand, or it may be a risk factor on the other. Thus, it has become important to examine other variables, such as perfectionism, that may influence the outcome, one way or another. This review examines the current evidence about the relations between perfectionism, athletics and eating disorders.",

      "title": "\"I have a personal claim to myself\": a visually impaired student's perspective on her participation in physical activity and physical education settings",
      "abstract": "In our daily lives, we often come across ideas and approaches that are intended to support and enhance our well-being, with the aim of achieving positive results, such as resilience and health, if implemented effectively. This trend can be understood as part of the long history of disciplining and normalizing the body in Western societies. Functioning, keeping up, and being resilient in our fast-paced society now appear to be the social norm. This status quo creates a link to physical education (PE) as a body-related school subject, where the focus is on the body and its performance. Several recent studies have explored the experiences of people with visual impairment (VI) in PE. For young people with blindness and visual impairment (BVI), sports and physical activity (PA) are deemed beneficial as they promote physical and mental health while increasing well-being and life satisfaction. These factors-well-being and life satisfaction-are closely intertwined with the concept of resilience. However, resilience cannot be conceived without acknowledging vulnerability, which people embody to different degrees. Vulnerability represents a human condition, as all people are potentially vulnerable. What can this concept mean for adolescents who are assigned to a so-called vulnerable group? This article aims to explore this question from a biography-oriented perspective. By adopting a critical perspective of Ableism within the context of Disability Studies, we reclassified societal attributions of abilities. This article focuses on a semi-narrative guided interview conducted with a 15-year-old teenager with BVI who had recently transitioned from inclusive mainstream schools to a state-approved special school for the visually impaired. Thus, she has had diverse experiences in both segregated and inclusive educational settings. This study highlights the extent to which empowering personal and non-personal factors are perceived as such and examines their interaction with participation in sports contexts. The findings critically reflect on the teachers' role in either enabling or hindering participation in PE, emphasizing the need for inclusion-sensitive approaches in teacher education.",

      "title": "Understanding the sexual lives of young people",
      "abstract": "The explosion in studies of sexuality, and its journey to a more central position in the social sciences began with the AIDS crisis when it became clear how little was known about contemporary sexual behaviour and the implications this might have for the AIDS epidemic. Many studies took an epidemiological or quantitative approach to sexual practices, what, how often, with or without condoms? (Johnson et al. 1994). Initially gay men were the target, seen as a group at risk, but the emphasis changed from risky groups to risky practices as it became clear that heterosexuals were not immune. Similarly the sensitive nature of the enquiry and the search for meanings to understand behaviour led to increasing use of qualitative approaches. The large field of youth studies encompasses a range of perspectives, typically breaking young lives into segments – psychological development, family, education, work, although pioneers advocate a holistic approach – or regard them as problems. Their sexuality is often ignored or marginalized in these studies, perhaps entering through the focus on problems requiring control. They might be drug users, smoking and drinking too much and becoming sexually active too young or in ways regarded as inappropriate by adults. Teenage mothers are a typical concern from a policy and research perspective. In addition, building on a long history of school ethnography, a large number of studies have examined the behaviour of young people in relation to sexual values, beliefs and practices and the concomitant construction of masculinity and femininity in schools. Those researching and writing about young people's sexual lives and sexuality standsomewhat apart from the mainstream of youth studies, which draws on social theory generally, and draw particularly on feminist and sexualities theorists (e.g. Foucault 1979; Connell 1995). They oppose essentialism as a way of understanding masculinity and femininity, and operate with a broadly social constructionist, or a deconstructive, postmodern or queer approach, although feminist materialism continues as important. Following on from feminist gender work and masculinity studies, many look at young men and women separately, but others grapple with both, just as they grapple with the relationship between sexuality and gender. This chapter draws largely on studies in Anglophoneand European countries to examine how the sexual lives and sexualities of young people have been studied and understood, and pursues five intersecting themes that emerge as critical in the literature: the relationship between sexuality and gender; hegemonic masculinity and male power; institutional reinforcement of heteronormativity; change and continuity – changing masculinities and femininities; and resistance.",

      "title": "Genetic contributors to pediatric obesity: beyond more iterations of BMI",
      "abstract": "Summary Accumulation of body fat is a complex process with a variety of interacting genetic factors. However, the effects exerted on energy balance via genetic, physiological and environmental factors are not independent fundamental agents, but rather different levels of the same causal framework. Although obesity itself may not have been an adaptive response, the physiology, behavior and metabolism established based upon selective pressures may confer adaptive changes. These mechanisms collide synergistically to promote fat deposition in an environment created by contemporary, sedentary behavior. Within the context of our past, genetic and epigenetic influences during the reproductive maturation process leading to variations in modern-day obesity phenotypes across populations presently observed are plausibly underpinned by lack of selective consequences to limit bodyweight in the modern environment. Although it is generally accepted that fat accumulation is a result of a breakdown in the homeostatic regulation of energy balance, neither the specific factors influencing the disruption, nor why these factors affect individuals differently, are understood completely. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the study of the contribution to energy imbalance must extend beyond the homeostatic physiological mechanisms and include numerous other aspects that act independently and/or synergistically.",

Since the beginning of human time, obesity has been linked to the inappropriate dosing of food, and calories have taken the majority of the blame. This principal is based on the laws of thermodynamics: energy cannot be created or destroyed so fat has to come from somewhere and nutrition is the main route in. However, the global epidemiology of obesity suggests that the biological system, although bound by these laws, is not as simple as once believed. First, the effect of dosing is disproportionate, with the beneficial result obtained from a dose somewhere in between an ineffective shortfall and a poisoning excess. Second, in a biological system the influence of dose is affected by many other factors – genes, environment, diet and lifestyle, for example. The dose is not only dependent on the individual, but also on their age, health, physical activity and even their body weight. The complexity is such that people of some nations remain trim on a higher energy intake than those of other nations who, despite eating less, are weighed down with adipose tissue.",

      "title": "Density-dependent environments can select for extremes of body size",
      "abstract": "Abstract Body size variation is an enigma. We do not understand why species achieve the sizes they do, and this means we also do not understand the circumstances under which gigantism or dwarfism is selected. We develop size-structured integral projection models to explore evolution of body size and life history speed. We make few assumptions and keep models simple: all functions remain constant across models except for the one that describes development of body size with age. We set sexual maturity to occur when size attains 80% of the asymptotic size, which is typical of a large mammal, and allow negative density dependence to only affect either reproduction or juvenile survival. Fitness – the quantity that is maximized by adaptive evolution – is carrying capacity in our models, and we are consequently interested in how it changes with size at sexual maturity, and how this association varies with development rate. The simple models generate complex dynamics while providing insight into the circumstances when extremes of body size evolve. The direction of selection leading to either gigantism or dwarfism crucially depends on the proportion of the population that is sexually mature, which in turn depends on how the development function determines the survivorship schedule. The developmental trajectories consequently interact with size-specific survival or reproductive rates to determine the best life history and the optimal body size emerges from that interaction. These dynamics result in trade-offs between different components of the life history, with the form of the trade-off that emerges depending upon where in the life history density dependence operates most strongly. Empirical application of the approach we develop has potential to help explain the enigma of body size variation across the tree of life.",

Twin, family, and adoption studies suggest 40% to 70% heritability of body mass index (BMI). 1 Several genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic polymorphisms that predispose people to weight gain in cases of common obesity. The strongest of these is the fat mass and obesity-associated risk allele, which is associated with weight gain of 3 to 4 kg. 2 Individuals may have more than one of these single nucleotide polymorphisms, which are single base changes in the DNA that may increase susceptibility to obesity. Copy number variants (CNVs), which are also called genomic structural variants, are another genetic phenomenon that can affect BMI. CNVs are deletions or duplications of chromosomal material. Deletion of a segment at the 16p11.2 locus, for example, is associated with severe, early-onset obesity and developmental delay.",

They also experience worse emotional outcomes, including less happiness and enjoyment, and more stress, worry, and anger. In part, these negative outcomes come from selection into living with a child, especially selection on poor health, which is associated with worse outcomes irrespective of living conditions. Yet even with controls, the elderly who live with children do worse. This is in sharp contrast to younger adults who live with children, likely their own, whose life evaluation is no different in the presence of the child once background conditions are controlled for. Parents, like elders, have enhanced negative emotions in the presence of a child, but unlike elders, also have enhanced positive emotions. In parts of the world where fertility rates are higher, the elderly do not appear to have lower life evaluations when they live with children; such living arrangements are more usual, and the selection into them is less negative. They also share with younger adults the enhanced positive and negative emotions that come with children. The misery of the elderly living with children is one of the prices of the demographic transition.",

Combining elements of both the traditional feminine and “modern” masculine roles was considered contributory to lower RC for the latter group.",

      "abstract": "1. Assessment 01 Normality Perhaps the most basic question of human growth in practice is simply , 'is this child normal? with respect to whatever aspect of its growth is being studied. This question introduces quite far-reaching difficulties, both logical and practical. To begin with, it is weil recognized that the term carries two distinct meanings. The first aims to relate the child to some kind of perfect or ideal standard; the norm in this sense is regarded as a target, quite possibly an inaccessible one which no child actually reaches, and the opposite of is subnormal. In its second sense, is roughly equivalent to occurring or ordinary. The norm is now simply the situation which most commonly occurs, and the opposite of is abnormal. The distinction is very clear in relation to body weight. In ill-nourished communities, most ordinary weights may be weil below any reasonable ideal standard, while in developed countries weights weil below ordinary levels may be ideal in that they are associated with longevity and freedom from disease. It is important to insist that in human growth studies (as throughout most of medicine) has in practice the second ofthese two senses, so that the normality of a particular child (or more precisely of some measured aspect of that child) is assessed by the frequency of occurrence of his measurement in a standardizing group, a group of children who are (as it were) normal by definition. The normative overtone of closeness to an ideal is seldom absent, but it has to be supplied by the tacit assumption that the members of the standardizing group themselves approximate to the desired state. This way of looking at normality automatically introduces the statistical notions of frequency and probability . This chapter gives abrief survey of the statistical problems which arise in assessing normality, especiaily those of con­ structing standards with which a given child can be compared. No attempt will be made to summarize the substantialliterature on the subject, but fuller discussions of the problems will be found in Tanner (1952), Goldstein (1972), and Healy (1974).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Puberty is often defined as that time over which the ability to reproduce is achieved. The word puberty is derived from the Latin pubescere, which means to be covered with hair. Neither this derivation nor a definition based on reproductive capacity can describe adequately the complex physiological processes involved. During puberty, the body grows to reach adult stature and physical maturation, the reproductive organs mature to become fully functional in producing mature ova and spermatozoa, and psychological changes occur related to both reproductive ability and body growth. Development of the secondary sexual characteristics, rapid skeletal growth to final adult stature, and changes in both lean body mass and fat distribution all occur. These must be precisely controlled and co-ordinated.",

However, little is known about the effects of exposure to the sexual homicide of a family member in youth. Sexual homicide can occur in a variety of situations and as a result of various motives. For youth who witness this event or who find the sexually violated and murdered body of a family member, there can be significant responses related to fears of ongoing threat to their safety or to the safety, stability, and structure of their family and environment. Severe traumas, such as sexual homicide, can have a detrimental effect on youth intrapsychic development and interpersonal relationships. These include posttraumatic stress disorder, with symptoms that can be disturbing and disruptive to daily routines and negatively affect a youth's otherwise normal growth and development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter explores the ways in which sex and gender influence health. Figures for mortality and life expectancy reveal important differences between men and women in their risk of death and in the causes of death. In virtually every country around the world, men have a lower life expectancy than women, although the gap in life expectancy is narrower in low-income countries. Similarly, women and men have different patterns of ill health, and again, the gap varies between countries. Both sex and gender play a part in these variations. Sex, or biological factors, influences women’s and men’s risks of different diseases and health conditions, including reproductive disorders and diseases affected by the immune system and genetic factors, as well as survival following diagnosis. However, socially constructed gender-linked factors are also important. Gender affects behaviours such as smoking and alcohol use, which increase the risk of certain conditions, and also affects exposure to social and environmental risk factors, including paid and unpaid work, caring responsibilities, poverty and poor environmental conditions, and the risk of sexual and physical violence.",

Regardless of one's views on luck, as random, personal, or magic, people are considered lucky when escaping risks unharmed, and unlucky when harmed. A risk is usually defined as the probability for an aversive event. In high-risk domains, or high-risk environments, probabilities are high, or the consequences are severe, or both. If luck depends on close and worse counterfactuals, risky or hazardous situations should have the potential of generating luck. Such situations might be considered dangerous. Beliefs in oneself as a lucky or unlucky person can further be based on personal memories of fortunate or unfortunate episodes in one's own life, without assumptions of hidden forces or a continued future luck. A lucky turn of events, a lucky coincidence, a lucky free kick in a football game, could easily, almost by definition have been less lucky.",

      "title": "Professionals’ Understanding of Risk Factors for Substance Misuse by Young People and Approaches to Intervention",
      "abstract": "Issues and trends in relation to substance misuse normally develop in the transitional phase of adolescence, as young people begin looking towards their peers for direction and are less subject to parental authority. Risk factors are predictors of the likelihood that an individual or group will be involved in activity leading to adverse consequences. Research indicates that some young people are beginning to initiate alcohol and drug use earlier than many adults suspect. In relation to substance misuse it is observed that risk and protection factors exist in equal measure within different context including within the individual, family, peer group, school and community settings. The enhancement of decision making by young people could delay or inhibit their engagement in harmful activity including substance misuse. If young people experiences substance use as enjoyable and without any negative consequences then it is likely they will not perceive risks relating to such use. Parental disapproval of substance misuse is a strong predictor of delayed initiation, whereas family instability and parental or sibling substance misuse, are identified as significant risk factors placing young people at greater danger of developing lifetime trajectories involving substance misuse. Assessment is central to the identification of needs and forms the basis for the establishment of integrated care plans framed within the context of multi-disciplinary and inter-agency collaboration. Governments and other organisations are required to play an active role in supporting the well-being of individuals, families and communities. As such, the practice of including children within adult categories when referring to “normal” alcohol consumption levels needs to be re-evaluated. Parents‟ and other adults require information about the risks and harmful effects of early onset substance misuse in order to make informed choices and to be empowered in taking a stance in relation to teenage substance misuse",

      "title": "P–487 Couples undergoing first level assisted reproductive techniques: An Actor-Partner interdependence model of dyadic adjustment, psychological symptoms, alexithymia and romantic attachment on body-image avoidance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Study question The study aims to assess the commonalities and interdependence of couples undergoing first-level Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) as regards body-image avoidance referred to body-image dissatisfaction. Summary answer Partners’ functioning seem specular yet not interdependent, as not showing a couple-as-a-unit modality of functioning. Body-image avoidance is only influenced by intra-personal variables. What is known already: Stressful bodily emotions and body perception related to infertility and ART are critical aspects for people desiring having children. Infertility undermines women’s self-esteem and body-image, damaging their self-identity as women, while in males infertility associates with body dissatisfaction referring to perceived reduced physical fitness and personal failure, thus undermining their body virility. For infertile women, body-image dissatisfaction associates with reduced marital adjustment, and vice-versa; yet no study has considered how males body-image dissatisfaction associates with marital satisfaction. Nonetheless, couples should be considered as a unit, considering that infertile couples’ adjustment is influenced by their own, and their partners’, perceived stress. Study design, size, duration The study follows a cross-sectional design and is part of an ongoing transversal and longitudinal project, started in 2012, investigating the well-being of couples undergoing ART. For the present study only a minority of the existing data were considered, thus only including couples at the first level of ART with the intent of investigating couples’ commonalities and interdependence before treatments pervasiveness increases. Participants/materials, setting, methods Minimum N = 79 couples needed to be considered according to Power analysis results. N = 118 couples aged 24 to 46 years (women Mage=34.92, SD = 3.98; men Mage=37.45, SD = 5.25) were included, and declaring trying to get pregnant from 1 to 8 years (M = 3.18; SD = 1.99) and to never had children, although 22.9% of women had at least an abortion. Participants completed the Body-Image Avoidance Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale–20, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Symptom Checklist–90-Revised and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised. Main results and the role of chance The sample presents non-clinical levels of functioning referring to their psychological symptoms, alexithymia and body-image avoidance. Multivariate rank tests show that females report significantly higher levels of body-image avoidance (stat=–5.73; adj.p=.001), psychological symptoms (stat=–4.58; adj.p=.001) and romantic anxious attachment (stat=–3.33; adj.p=.005). These differences were confirmed also after applying multiplicity control. Moreover, bi-variate Pearson’s r correlations show an association among partners’ dyadic adjustment (r=.293; p&amp;lt;.001), albeit their overall level of dyadic adjustment is low. Significant correlations among partners also emerged as regards psychological symptoms (r=.258; p&amp;lt;.001) and alexithymia (r=.16; p=.05). The couple-effect, thus considering the couple as the unit of analysis, was modeled through an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. For both partners, dyadic adjustment’s actor-effect associates with body-image avoidance (women: β = 0.133, p=.026; man: β = 0.133, p=.026). Furthermore, for both men and women, psychological symptoms’ actor-effect associate to body-image avoidance (women: β = 0.467, p&amp;lt;.00; men: β = 0.499, p=.001). Comparing the level of influence of actor and partner effects among partners, the psychological symptoms’ actor effect results significantly more influential than the partner-effect (women: Δ = 0.378, p=.015; men: Δ = 0.587, p=.001). Only for males, alexithymia’s actor effect is significant (β = 0.499; p=.001). Limitations, reasons for caution Results should be considered in light of some limitations. Specifically, the cross-sectional study design, lack of a control group with no infertility issues, the use of self-report measures, homogeneity among couples and the sample small sample size (although sample size was appropriate to retain a power of at least .8). Wider implications of the findings: Results support the differentiation of gender-specific psychosocial interventions along the ART path, preventing and mitigating the negative impact of infertility and ART on body-image dissatisfaction and avoidance and on the couples’ well-being.

      "title": "Do wealth and inequality associate with health in a small-scale subsistence society?",
      "abstract": "Poverty is bad for health. People living in poverty are more likely to struggle to afford nutritious food, lack access to health care, or be overworked or stressed. This may make them susceptible to chronic diseases, contribute to faster aging, and shorten their lifespans. In high-income countries, there is growing evidence to suggest that a person’s ‘rank’ in society also impacts their health. For example, individuals who have a lower position in the social hierarchy report worse health outcomes, regardless of their incomes. But it is unclear why living in an unequal society or having a lower social status contributes to poorer health. One possibility is that inequalities in society are creating a stressful environment that leads to worse physical and mental outcomes. It is thought that this stress largely comes from how humans evolved to prioritize reaching a higher social status over having a long and healthy life. If this is the case, this would mean that the link between social status and health would also be present in non-industrialized communities where social hierarchies tend to be less pronounced. To test this, Jaeggi, Blackwell et al. studied the Indigenous Tsimane population in Bolivia who live in small communities and forage and farm their own food. The income and relative wealth of 870 households from 40 Tsimane communities were compared against various outcomes, including symptoms associated with depression, stress hormone levels, blood pressure, self-rated health and several diseases. Jaeggi, Blackwell et al. found poverty and inequality did not negatively impact all of the health outcomes measured as has been previously reported for industrialized societies. However, blood pressure was higher among people with lower incomes or those who lived in more unequal communities. But because the Tsimane people generally have low blood pressure, the differences were too small to have much effect on their health. People who lived in more unequal communities were also three times more likely to have respiratory infections, but the reason for this was unclear. This shows that social determinants such as a person’s wealth or inequality can affect health, even in communities with less rigid social hierarchies. In industrial societies the effect may be worse in part because they are compounded by lifestyle factors, such as diets rich in fat and sugar, and physical inactivity which can also increase blood pressure. This information may help policy makers reduce health disparities by addressing some of the social determinants of health and the lifestyle factors that cause them.",

      "title": "Men and the War on Obesity",
      "abstract": "Is obesity really a public health problem and what does the construction of obesity as a health problem mean for men? According to official statistics, the majority of men in nations such as England and the USA are overweight or obese. Public health officials, researchers, governments and various agencies are alarmed and have issued dire warnings about a global ‘obesity epidemic’. This perceived threat to public health seemingly legitimates declarations of war against what one US Surgeon General called ‘the terror within’. Yet, little is known about weight-related issues among everyday men in this context of symbolic or communicated violence. Men and the War on Obesity is an original, timely and controversial study. Using observations from a mixed-sex slimming club, interviews with men whom medicine might label overweight or obese and other sources, this study urges a rethink of weight or fat as a public health issue and sometimes private trouble. Recognizing the sociological wisdom that things are not as they seem, it challenges obesity warmongering and the many battles it mandates or incites. This important book could therefore help to change current thinking and practices not only in relation to men but also women and children who are defined as overweight, obese or too fat. It will be of interest to students and researchers of gender and the body within sociology, gender studies and cultural studies as well as public health researchers, policymakers and practitioners.",

Unclaimed dead in Marion County, Indiana, 2004-2011, are examined. Comparisons are provided of the unclaimed to the claimed dead population and county death patterns. Race, gender, marital status, age, location, manner and cause of death, NoK, and days to disposition are analyzed. The unclaimed dead were disproportionately male, slightly more likely to be Black, younger at death, died from natural causes, had unknown marital status, were equally likely as not to have NoK, did not die in a hospital, and were subject to autopsy. Nearly half the unclaimed had NoK who did not claim the body; the other half had no identifiable NoK. Unclaimed were more likely to have an autopsy and to die from external causes. Most unclaimed were identified by means outside fingerprints or DNA.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Growth and Maturation in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "The term adolescence denotes the period of time between the onset of puberty and the completion of physical maturation. During these transitional years, full reproductive capacity is attained, manifested by spermatogenesis in the male and ovulation in the female. Concomitantly, major physical changes occur, including (1) full maturation of the gonads, external genitalia, and secondary sexual characteristics, (2) alterations in lean body mass and fat distribution, and (3) rapid skeletal growth, ultimately terminated by fusion of the epiphyses and the attainment of final adult stature. Although we are accustomed to equating adolescence with the teenage years, the last century has been characterized by a progressive lowering of the normal age for pubertal development, so that presently, 50% of girls in the United States reach puberty while in elementary school. The implications of this earlier physical maturation, particularly in terms of sexual education and contraception counseling are readily evident. Furthermore, as the normal onset of puberty occurs earlier, the psychological ramifications of pubertal delay and short stature in adolescence become increasingly pronounced. It is not unusual, nowadays, to see 13 or 14-year-old patients (and their parents) who are concerned about delays in sexual maturation and skeletal growth, and while the majority of such patients are found to be normal variants, their anxieties and concerns are nonetheless real.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article explores ageism and age‐based discrimination in the context of global population ageing. It accomplishes this by (1) situating ageism in historical, psychological, global, epidemiological and health systems contexts; (2) distinguishing implicit and explicit forms of ageism and ethical arguments supporting age discrimination; (3) considering how ageism intersects with ableism, sex‐based discrimination, heterosexism, racism and midlife bias and (4) exploring evidence‐based strategies for combatting ageism. Key Concepts Ageism is negative stereotyping based on age. In wealthier nations, ageism is more frequently directed against older adults. In poorer nations, ageism is more often directed toward younger people. Ageism intersects with other forms of bias, such as ableism, gender-based bias, heterosexism, racism, and midlife bias. Age discrimination or favoring an individual or group based on age is sometimes defended on ethical grounds, such as utilitarian arguments designed to show that older people produce less return on investment or non-utilitarian arguments that after a certain age an individual has lived a fair number of innings.",

There was a negative non-significant correlation between conscientiousness and agreeableness and paranormal belief. There was a positive non-significant correlation between openness, neuroticism, extraversion and spirituality and paranormal belief. Religiosity was significantly positively correlated with paranormal belief. Males and females also showed difference in paranormal belief.

      "title": "Stress and alcohol: epidemiologic evidence.",
      "abstract": "Exposure to stress often is psychologically distressing. The impact of stress on alcohol use and the risk of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) depends on the type, timing during the life course, duration, and severity of the stress experienced. Four important categories of stressors that can influence alcohol consumption are general life stress, catastrophic/fateful stress, childhood maltreatment, and minority stress. General life stressors, including divorce and job loss, increase the risk for AUDs. Exposure to terrorism or other disasters causes population-level increases in overall alcohol consumption but little increase in the incidence of AUDs. However, individuals with a history of AUDs are more likely to drink to cope with the traumatic event. Early onset of drinking in adolescence, as well as adult AUDs, are more common among people who experience childhood maltreatment. Finally, both perceptions and objective indicators of discrimination are associated with alcohol use and AUDs among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities. These observations demonstrate that exposure to stress in many forms is related to subsequent alcohol consumption and AUDs. However, many areas of this research remain to be studied, including greater attention to the role of various stressors in the course of AUDs and potential risk moderators when individuals are exposed to stressors.",

El modelo hegemónico remite a una masculinidad dominante sobre las mujeres y sobre otros hombres. La masculinidad hegemónica representa el referente de fortaleza, dominio, fuerza, desconexión de la emotividad y el privilegio social que se les otorga a los hombres. Es a través del deporte que el hombre forma y conforma su cuerpo, frente a otros hombres y frente a las mujeres. El deporte es sin dudas, el espacio público en donde se encuentran los hombres como iguales junto a sus pares. En este ritual deportivo los cuerpos masculinos se reafirman entre sí a la distancia de las mujeres. En la búsqueda del cuerpo que desean, los atletas pueden recurrir a comportamientos de riesgo a partir de su percepción del cuerpo. Aquellos atletas con alteraciones en la percepción de su imagen corporal pueden desarrollar conductas perturbadas en su alimentación lo que puede tener consecuencias en la aparición de trastornos en la conducta alimentaria. En este estudio con 385 atletas varones de nivel universitario, seleccionados por disponibilidad, se exploró la percepción del cuerpo, el nivel de adherencia al modelo hegemónico de la masculinidad y la presencia de indicadores de trastornos en la conducta alimentaria. Los hallazgos indican que el 76% se adhiere de manera moderada o alta al modelo tradicional de la masculinidad, 15% reportan indicadores de disturbios en la conducta alimentaria y 9% informó dificultades con su imagen corporal. Se encontró una relación significativa entre el modelo tradicional de la masculinidad y trastornos en la conducta alimentaria y entre tener dificultades con la imagen corporal y la presencia de indicadores de trastornos en la conducta alimentaria.",

      "title": "Reimagize – a digital card-based roleplaying game to improve adolescent girls’ body image",
      "abstract": "The perceived importance of beauty and physical appearance in 21st-century society is immense. Research has previously been found that being thin and/or muscular has become associated with being “hard-working, successful, popular, beautiful, strong, and self-disciplined,” whereas being “fat” is associated with being “lazy, ignorant, hated, ugly, weak, and lacking in will-power.” These stereotypes can negatively affect one’s self-esteem and ultimately result in poor performance or eating disorders. With that in mind, Reimagize, a role-playing with decision-making, was conjured, implementing social psychological concepts like counter-stereotyping and perspective-taking. As the game works implicitly to influence body image, it even counters image issues beyond personal body dissatisfaction. This study explored whether a digital role-playing card game, incorporating some of the most common prejudices of body image (like size prejudice, prejudices from the media, etc.) as identified by a digital survey/questionnaire completed by Indian girls aged 11-21, could counter these issues and reduce personal body dissatisfaction. The real-world effectiveness of the game was tested among 44 high school-age Indian girls using the Body Esteem Scale. In the pre- and post-game phases, there was a significant increase in the scores of the girls in the experimental group, specifically in weight concern and physical condition. Subscores in sexual attractiveness remained stagnant. With this success, there is scope to expand to other genders to improve body image, creating a positive change.",

      "title": "Males with eating disorders: challenges for treatment and research.",
      "abstract": "Males represent only 10 percent of eating disorder cases. This gender discrepancy is among the most extreme in psychiatry and medicine. Determining what differences in etiology and mechanism best explain the discrepancy presents an intellectual challenge. Beginning at about the third grade, boys and girls diverge in social development. Boys show significantly less desire to lose weight, express dissatisfaction with the upper rather than the lower body, and use dieting to achieve specific external goals rather than as a cultural norm. Males reach a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than females do before they beginning dieting. (27.2 versus 24.3, p < .01). While overall treatment principles are similar, males in treatment require attainment of a different hormonal milieu (testosterone), attention to past and future sexual role, amelioration of perception of stigma, and preparation for return to male social roles. Males and females suffer comparable degrees of osteopenia and brain shrinkage during anorexia nervosa. The effectiveness of antidepressants in males with eating disorders (compared with that in females) has not been well studied. Male gender is not an adverse factor in short-term or long-term treatment outcome. Understanding the lower frequency of these illnesses in males may lead to more effective means of protecting girls from eating disorders and from the culturally induced distress about normal body size and shape that burdens adolescent development and adult life.",

      "title": "Studies in the Influence of Various Factoes in Nutrition Upon the Growth of Experimental Tumors. I",
      "abstract": "The problem of cancer is but one aspect of the broader problem of growth. Just as the young organism is distinguished from the adult by its power to grow, so the cells of the tumor differ primarily from those of the host in their capacity for rapid, and apparently unlimited, increase. Unless proved to the contrary, it must be assumed that the same agencies which are responsible for growth in the young organism are also concerned in the growth of the tumor. Whether the various factors concerned are of equal importance in the two processes, whether each bears the same relation to growth under the two conditions, is at least partly open to experimental investigation at the present time.\n\nWithin recent years, the researches of Hopkins, Mendel and Osborne, McCollum, and Funk, together with a number of other investigators, have opened a new era in the science of nutrition. Diets which were formerly believed to be sufficient to maintain life and growth have been found to be wholly inadequate to do either. According to recent conceptions, We may regard diets as “deficient” in any one or more of four ways. Firstly, a diet may be deficient in protein, in inorganic salts, or in water; secondly, it may be deficient in content of calories, i.e., it may not yield enough energy for the requirements of the organism, through a quantitative deficiency in carbohydrates, or fats, or both. Thirdly, it may be deficient in certain fundamentally necessary amino acids, which the organism cannot synthesize. An example of a diet of this type would be one properly balanced in regard to protein, fat, carbohydrate, inorganic salts, accessories, and water, from a quantitative standpoint, but in which the sole source of nitrogen is gelatin or zein. Certain amino acids which the organism cannot synthesize are lacking in such a diet, and the animal will perish after a more or less brief period if they are not furnished. Lastly, the diet may be complete in regard to the essential ordinary food-stuffs while lacking in the so-called accessory food substances (the “water-soluble A, and the fat-soluble B” of McCollum, the “vitamines” of Funk). If such “accessory” food materials are not supplied, the death of the organism will surely ensue. No one has succeeded in maintaining the life of an animal over a reasonably long period upon any diet of chemically purified food-stuffs.",

      "title": "The Relationship between Variability in Physical Growth and Academic Achievement Among Third- and Fifth-Grade Children",
      "abstract": "MUCH RESEARCH has been carried on during thepast four decades to determine the relationship between various measures of physical growth and measures of intelligence and of academic achievement. This research has shown rather consistent low positive correlations between measures of physical growth and of mental age or intelligence. These results have been interpreted quite differently by various writers, as represented in Paterson and Olson. Paterson maintains that since childhood is a period of growth, positive corre lations are to be expected but are not evidence of an underlying unity of growth (2). Olson writes that there is an underlying unity of growth which manifests itself in the various aspects of growth, mental as well as physical, and that children tend to grow at a uniform rate in all areas. Olson's concept of organ ismicage is an attempt to ascertain an individual's center of growth gravity. Also, he suggests that a pattern of growth which is inconsistent or variable ; i. e. , high in some measures, medium in others, and low in still others, may reflect an underlying disturbance of the organism that may influence academic achievement in either of two ways: similar variability in achievement or lower achievement (1). The present research was designed to test two hypotheses related to Olson's ideas: (1) variability in physical growth is accompanied by variability in academic achievement, (2) variability in physical growth is accompanied by low academic achievement. Variability was defined as an index of irregularity infive physical measures: height, weight, strength of grip, dentition, carpal development; or in three achievement measures: reading, arithmetic, and language. Subsequently, dentition was dropped from the physical variability index for reasons to be re ported later. Subjects The subjects were 54 third-grade and 66 fifth-grade children enrolled in four classrooms of two elementary schools. The children's mean chronological age was near the mean of carpal and dental age but well below the mean age of height, weight, strength, mental, and achievement in reading, arithmetic, and language. Seventy-five per cent of the children's fathers were in the profession",

Social influences on food intake refer to the impact that one or more persons have on the eating behavior of others, either direct or indirect, either conscious or subconscious. Even when eating alone, food choice is influenced by social factors because attitudes and habits develop through the interaction with others. As the need for nutrition education, change is the most important. Food preferences pose a problem with the people in the selection of food. Most people do not have conditions to ensure healthy food which suits meal-times. Some others see nutritious instructions as boring, unpleasant and inappropriate. Lack of time, often does not to dedicate relevance of food choices, especially among the educated young people. Practical aspects such as cost, preparation and poor availability of time due to work are common barriers to the recommended changes. Lack of knowledge about the importance of healthy eating is not perceived by consumers as the main barrier to changing diets, although it is quite important.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Relatively few older adults are physically active despite extensive research exploring barriers and facilitators and concomitant interventions designed to enhance participation rates. Building on the growing literature that considers the subjective experience of being physically active, we explored the meanings that older Canadian men attributed to physical activity broadly defined. Thus, we examined their experiences and perceptions of exercise, sport and/or leisure-time physical activities. Data are presented from qualitative interviews with 22 community-dwelling Canadian men aged 67–90. Our analysis resulted in three overarching categories that subsumed the men's understanding of physical activity. ‘I do it for my health’ described how the men stated that their primary reason for engaging in exercise was to maintain their health and body functionality so that they could age well and continue to participate in sport and leisure. ‘It feels good’ referred to the various ways that the men derived pleasure from being active, including the physical sensations, psychological benefits and social connections they derived from their participation. ‘It gets tougher’ detailed the ways that the men were finding physical activity to be increasingly difficult as a result of the onset of health problems, declining body functionality and the social realities of ageing. We discuss our findings in light of the extant literature concerning age relations, ageism, and the third and fourth ages.",

      "title": "Behavioral Inhibition as a Temperamental Category",
      "abstract": "Abstract Historical changes in the sense meaning of the term temperament have been less dramatic than alterations in other important psychological concepts, such as emotion, memory, symptom, or perception. Most ancient and modern writers agreed that the human temperaments were combinations of psychological profiles (behaviors, thoughts, and emotions) and their presumed biological foundations, which, during this century, were assumed to be genetically mediated. A set of psychological features was not sufficient evidence to posit a temperamental disposition. Chronic shyness with strangers, for example, need not be due to a temperamental bias, because some shy adults could have acquired that trait during adolescence. A combination of a psychological profile and its presumed biological foundation represents the ideal definition of a temperament. Combining behavior with biological measures is common in other domains. An individual born with the genes for compromised pancreatic function who has normal blood sugar levels is not diabetic. An adolescent born to two schizophrenic parents who displays one non debilitating marker of this illness is not regarded as schizophrenic as long as he or she does not display any of the primary symptoms that define the category. However, the lack of insight into the biological contribution to temperament has meant that, at present, the psychological features compose the primary definition of temperament. The definition of temperament offered here suggests the potential error in classifying a trait as temperamental simply because it is stable over long periods of time. Future research on the temperaments will gather biological data and, if possible, begin with observations of young children. As investigators discover sensitive biological markers for each of the temperamental types, they will be able to separate groups of children or adults who display similar behavioral phenotypes into those who probably do and probably do not possess the relevant temperaments. The research of Davidson (1994, 1995) and Fox, Schmidt, Calkins, Rubin, &amp; Coplan (1996) on asymmetry of alpha power in frontal areas illustrates this point. These investigators suggest that greater activation in the right frontal area than in the left (that is, greater desynchronization of alpha frequencies on the right side) is a sensitive sign of a temperamental vulnerability to uncertainty and/or anxiety. As a result, scientists can gather the electroencephalograph (EEG) data on groups of anxious adults and parse these samples into distinct groups based on the presence or absence of right-hemisphere activation. This suggestion is not fanciful. My laboratory has been following a large group of middleclass, Caucasian children who were evaluated initially at 4 months of age (see Kagan, 1994). Twenty percent of the infants, called high reactive, displayed high levels of motor activity and distress to a variety of unfamiliar stimuli; 40% of the sample, classified as low reactive, showed the complementary profile of minimal motor activity and distress. More children from the high-reactive group became shy and fearful in the second year, whereas most low reactives became relatively sociable and fearless.",

El nivel de condicion fisica tiene un componente genetico y otro ligado al estilo de vida. Dado que este ultimo se condiciona en gran medida durante la juventud, se plantea la hipotesis de que el nivel de condicion fisica es ya en edades tempranas un importante determinante de salud con repercusion en la vida adulta. En base a ello, el objetivo de la presente tesis doctoral ha sido profundizar en el estudio de la condicion fisica en una epoca de la vida importante y poco estudiada como es la adolescencia, caracterizando la relacion existente entre los niveles de condicion fisica y el nivel de maduracion biologica, adiposidad y factores de programacion que puedan ocurrir a nivel prenatal/neonatal. Igualmente, se pretende estudiar importantes aspectos metodologicos relacionados con la evaluacion de la condicion fisica, y todo ello tanto en adolescentes espanoles como de otros paises europeos.

While past reviews suggest a mild connection between obesity and overall self-esteem, few have delved into how obesity impacts the different aspects of self-worth and overall life satisfaction in young people. A comprehensive literature review covering studies from 1999 onward- including different aspects of the relationship between self-esteem and obesity of adolescents such as self-esteem in adolescents, body weight and self-perception, link between obesity and low self-esteem, gender differences, social and environmental influences, cultural and societal influences, psychological comorbidities, family dynamics and parental influence, role of social media and digital influences etc. Areas most affected include physical ability, body image, and social interactions. These effects appeared consistent across age groups, though research on differences by gender and ethnicity remains scarce. Interestingly, improvements in self-perceived abilities were noted regardless of whether weight loss occurred, emphasizing the potential of psychological and functional outcomes as meaningful targets for future interventions.",

While some writers attempt to distinguish between SGA and intrauterine growth retardation, with SGA meaning a birth weight less than an arbitrary standard for gestational age and intrauterine growth retardation referring to an infant whose size at birth is ‘less than its potential’, for the purpose of this chapter both terms will be used to dtiscribed infants whose weight at birth is below some arbitrary cut-off point for their gestational age.",

The overall stereotypes of overweight persons were both negative and unrelated to subjects' own degree of obesity, although individuals reported that their personal views were less negative than those of others. Women indicated greater concern with obesity than men in several ways, and the societal stereotype of an overweight woman was seen as more negative than that of an overweight man. Men were more concerned about a date's weight than women, and White women's weight (unlike that of other subgroups) was negatively related to their likelihood and frequency of dating. Although Blacks, particularly Black females, were heavier than Whites, they were more satisfied with their body shape. Black males were less likely than White males to have refused to date someone because of her weight, and Blacks personally considered overweight women to be more attractive, sexier, less ugly, and less sloppy than did Whites. The findings suggest that both gender and ethnicity should be considered when discussing people's attitudes towards obesity and the consequences of such attitudes.",

ESD and ESR can lead to widely varying and unstable population sex ratios. Populations exposed to conditions such as endocrine-active substances or temperature shifts may decline over time due to skewed sex ratios, a scenario that may become increasingly relevant with greater anthropogenic interference on watercourses. Continuous exposure of populations to factors causing ESR could lead to the extinction of genetic sex factors and may render a population dependent on the environmental factors that induce the sex change. However, ESR also presents opportunities for population management, especially if the Y or W chromosome is not, or not severely, degenerated. This seems to be the case in many amphibians and fish. Population growth or decline in such species can potentially be controlled through the introduction of so-called Trojan sex genes carriers, individuals that possess sex chromosomes or genes opposite from what their phenotype predicts. Here, we review the conditions for ESR, its prevalence in natural populations, the resulting physiological and reproductive consequences, and how these may become instrumental for population management.",

The paper mainly discusses the influence of self-regulation and eating disorders on adolescents. With the improvement of technology, adolescents are more susceptible to eating and lifestyle that lead to unhealthy social stigma and unstable emotions such as body dissatisfaction, especially in women. Due to the lack of a unified understanding of eating disorders, the prevalence rate of eating disorders has rapidly increased. Willpower is suggested to be an essential mechanism that influences one's self-regulation in eating behaviors. A high level of willpower can help them better regulate their emotions control their eating behaviors. This paper also discusses social cultural difference as one of the influencing factors. Eating disorders are a controversial topic, and there is still no unified conclusion that plays a role through the self-regulation ability. Further studies should review the effectiveness to improve self-regulation ability.",

Alex was raised in a “holler” in West Virginia. While his peers were navigating the stresses of emerging adulthood, Alex carried the additional burden of experiencing gender dysphoria, a deep sense of incongruence between the biological sex he was assigned at birth (female) and his gender identity (male). Though well‐intentioned, his parents made it clear that his desire to be male was sinful and would not be tolerated in their family. He felt hopeless — “repulsive” even. Alex decided he could suppress his female identity interminably, risk coming out and being rejected by his family and community, or end his life .",

If this proves to be true, genetic testing for APOE status might be encouraged, or required, to minimize the costs of participation in high-contact sports, such as ice hockey, soccer, rugby, and boxing, where head injury is likely to occur. Under some circumstances, testing minors for this purpose might be justifiable. This would raise complex ethical and legal questions about respective powers and rights of adolescents and parents. The wishes of the \"nearly competent\" adolescent not to be tested should override parental desires for testing, although such a conclusion has only limited warrant in Canadian law. If a mature adolescent wishes testing, but the parents do not, testing may be permissible--although Canadian law is again unclear. The physician should not be able to inform the parents of the test results without the adolescent's consent, nor should the adolescent be forced to disclose those results.",

This essay reviews the empirical evidence on just how consistent and changeable personality traits are across the life course. To gain a thorough perspective on personality trait development, we review developmental studies that focus on three different types of change: rank‐order consistency, mean level change, and individual level change. Starting in late childhood, personality traits exhibit modest levels of rank‐order consistency that increase with age. In addition personality traits show mean level changes, especially in young adulthood, that are consistent with the idea of increasing maturity. Finally, despite these general trends in personality continuity and change, there is evidence that individuals may change in ways that contradict general trends and that these individual differences in change are related to life experiences.",

      "abstract": "Is being overweight distressing? If it is, is the distress due to negative appraisals by others, to the stresses of trying to fit norms of thinness by dieting, or to the health consequences of being overweight? If being overweight is stigmatizing, negative evaluations by others may be internalized as high levels of depression. This perspective predicts that being overweight has a direct effect on depression, and that the effect is greater in social groups where being overweight is less common, especially among women, Whites, younger people, the well-educated, and the well-to-do. Alternatively, overweight may not be distressing per se. Instead, attempting to fit norms of appearance that equate thinness with attractiveness by dieting is distressing. According to this perspective, the association between being overweight and depression is explained by dieting. Finally, this association may be due to the health consequences of being overweight. A random sample of 2,020 U.S. adults aged 18-90 were interviewed by telephone in 1990. Results showed that being overweight has no direct effect on depression in any social group except among the well-educated. Overweight persons are more likely to diet and to experience worse physical health, both of which are associated with depression. Combined, these explain the negative effects of being overweight on depression.",

      "title": "Genetic Diversity and the Survival of Populations",
      "abstract": "Abstract: In this comprehensive review, a range of factors is considered that may influence the significance of genetic diversity for the survival of a population. Genetic variation is essential for the adaptability of a population in which quantitatively inherited, fitness‐related traits are crucial. Therefore, the relationship between genetic diversity and fitness should be studied in order to make predictions on the importance of genetic diversity for a specific population. The level of genetic diversity found in a population highly depends on the mating system, the evolutionary history of a species and the population history (the latter is usually unknown), and on the level of environmental heterogeneity. An accurate estimation of fitness remains complex, despite the availability of a range of direct and indirect fitness parameters. There is no general relationship between genetic diversity and various fitness components. However, if a lower level of heterozygosity represents an increased level of inbreeding, a reduction in fitness can be expected. Molecular markers can be used to study adaptability or fitness, provided that they represent a quantitative trait locus (QTL) or are themselves functional genes involved in these processes. Next to a genetic response of a population to environmental change, phenotypic plasticity in a genotype can affect fitness. The relative importance of plasticity to genetic diversity depends on the species and population under study and on the environmental conditions. The possibilities for application of current knowledge on genetic diversity and population survival for the management of natural populations are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

Significant sex differences, showing the male to be at a disadvantage, were found in performance on all scales. The possibility that these differences in performance were related to neonatal experience was supported by the finding of significant sex differences in neonatal condition. Males, although they have the advantage of higher birthweight, do less well than females from birth through 4 years of age. Although these sex differences must have a basic genetic origin, it was suggested that such factors as obstetrical problems, neonatal distress, and maternal attitudes may have a mediating effect.

      "abstract": "In our society a huge tension is caused by three types of contradictory messages in relation to our body structure: medical message, aesthetic message and gastronomic message. The abundance of food, some very attractive, together with the social \"order\" of having to be slim to be accepted, originates very complicated internal situations that lead predisposed people to develop an eating disorder. In concrete, bulimia nervosa is a disorder nobody spoke about three decades ago, and there are only some detailed references about it in the last 80 years. In 1979, Rusell coined the name of bulimia nervosa and considered it as a variation of the anorexia. From the 80s on, it has been noticed how the incidence of the bulimia nervosa has increased, with an important quantitative variability, being a reason for concern among health professionals and our society in general, and for the families who suffer its consequences in particular. Not likely to be a new disorder, since the references to excesses with food and to vomiting are so old that they cannot be traced in time. The origin of this disorder is multifactorial and although personality factors and environmental elements are implied, it is also true that there is a genetic predisposition that is not still well known. The individuals with bulimia nervosa show a wide range of functional limitations that are linked to the disorder, being the social field the one which can probably be affected more negatively. For all this, nowadays the deployment of resources and efforts has been increased by the health authorities, in order to implement therapeutic procedures, to boost ways of prevention and to reinforce the rehabilitation of all the aspects implied in the disorder.",

The status quo bias happens when individual decision makers attach an extra value in their default or status quo option in sequential decision-making. This paper focussed on the presence of the status quo bias in economic decision-making and looked at the influence of personal characteristics, like being an adolescent or young adult, a “high” versus “low” confident individual, and a “high” versus “low” risk-seeking individual. According to the results of this paper, the presence of the status quo bias does depend on if someone has a “high” or “low” confidence level. On the other hand, being an adolescent or a young adult, or having different levels of risk-seeking behaviour does not significantly influence the presence of a status quo bias in economic decision-making. Still, a few tests showed that adolescents were less influenced by the status quo bias compared to young adults. Therefore, it could be the case that the main factors influencing the presence of the status quo bias, come into play when someone becomes an adult. Although behavioural biases have been investigated in many different areas, adolescents have been overlooked. Learning more about the presence and reasons behind possible “bad” biases influencing adolescents, could be very helpful. Knowing what kind of biases play a role influencing adolescents can help, to better educate a new generation of managers, who are less likely to fall for “bad” biases.",

Cumulative effects of good health behaviors throughout one's life often pay off in older adulthood, in the form of healthy aging (optimal physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning), whereas poorer choices earlier in life can lead to suboptimal or even pathological aging. Personality characteristics are important predictors of health behaviors and thus influence the course of healthy aging. Personality also impacts other precursors to healthy aging, such as educational attainment, work and career choices, financial success, relationship and family outcomes, and attitudes toward engagement and involvement in later life. Through multiple pathways, not only health and health behavior, personality predicts positive aging-related outcomes.",

The following examples are presented: Too little growth; too little resorption; too much resorption; a resorptive process normal in character but occurring in an abnormal location; a growth process normal in character but occurring in an abnormal location and, finally, too much growth of some particular structure or tissue. With this variety of developmental mechanisms involved, the futility of expecting to find any blanket cause of congenital defects should be self-evident. Moreover, one would not expect to find the various causative factors even in the same category. See figure in the PDF.file In cases of too little growth, i.e., cases of the \"developmental arrest\" type, one would naturally look for deficiency factors, or for inhibiting factors-genetic or environmental. In the case of too much or too little resorption as a secondary moulding process, or with growth or resorptive processes out of their normal territory, one would look for regulatory factors. So, also, with disturbances in timing, which were not discussed but which I believe we will find of great importance when we know more accurately the rate at which critical developmental process should normally progress. See figure in the PDF.file Finally, especial emphasis is placed on defects involving the overproduction of a tissue, or a structure, because the factors which might cause overgrowth must be of a different nature than the inhibiting or deficiency factors we have so long been accustomed to emphasize. See figure in the PDF.file I feel certain that in other papers in this conference there will be stressing of the multiplicity of etiologic factors, as well as similar emphasis on the variety of developmental mechanisms involved. I believe that we shall gain the conviction that each type of defect and each possible etiologic factor must be intensively studied on an individual basis if we are to make sound progress instead of bogging down in a morass of vague generalizations.",

In view of the tradition of viewing adolescence as a difficult time of life, there is a belief that adolescence is perhaps the time of the life span with most substantial personality development. This chapter builds on personality development by drawing on many of the same meta-analyses. Evaluating changes in average levels of personality is one way to approach the study of personality development, and evidence from this type of study suggests that changes in personality are not especially pronounced in adolescence. Evidence for the idea that personality change is greatest during adolescence would come from studies that showed that over-time correlations are weakest during that period.",

      "title": "This is or is not food: framing malnutrition, obesity and healthy eating",
      "abstract": "A lot of ethical research on food and agriculture focuses on distribution, responsibilities, access and impacts that harm others. However not much reflective analysis is done with respect to ontological assumptions of food and food production which are world disclosing views. They are not only perceptions, but ways people act upon an event that is seen as food, built networks of food, solve problems and connect food with other events. Cases of framing comprise malnutrition, obesity and healthy eating. Strategies of supplementation and biofortification frame 'malnutrition as a health problem', and propose health strategies with drugs or crops with added on drugs or vitamins. Their solutions underestimate the agricultural complexity of malnutrition and deliver only temporary relief. Framing the problem as a agricultural problem would imply taking into account the reduction of micronutrients during the postharvest phase. Secondly, ethics of obesity assumes the 'definition of obesity as the unbalance between energy input (food) and energy output'. This seemingly neutral definition is framed because many put emphasis on the first term, the input, and require people to eat sober and in particular to restrain oneself in the things one likes to eat. One should measure the things one is eating, weigh oneself every day and eat alone, not to be distracted by social gatherings. However, framing food as a pleasurable and social event, direct solutions of obesity to eating only the food one likes together with others. Finally, 'nutrigenomical healthy eating assumes that one shouldn't put trust in one's own body', but in biomarkers. Their quantitative outcomes are presented as moralizing directions what to eat. Healthy eating differently framed as a strategy of learning to trust one's body, and to understand the signals that it gives together with the collective responsibilities for a meal, is outframed by this assumption. These cases will serve as a basis for generalizations on the functions of ontological, world disclosing assumptions and their ethical analysis. Food is the famous elephant in the room and has all characteristics of a multi-complex wicked problem with multi-meaning frames. Frame analysis should therefore in explicating frames strive for a transparent cooperative deliberation between them.",

Weight discrimination can negatively impact social interactions, emotional well-being, as well as physical health. The combined effects of discrimination based on race and weight are of special interest, because it is likely that overweight racial minority groups like Black and Hispanic individuals will exhibit worse health outcomes than similarly overweight White individuals. Research indicates that the psychosocial effects of racial discrimination, plus weight discrimination can exacerbate problematic behaviors in minority group members, but not so much in racial majority members. Our survey results reinforced what previous research has already stated, that Black and Hispanic individuals are most likely to suffer from obesity, racial discrimination, and socioeconomic issues. Furthermore, the results also showed that participants viewed White individuals as having fewer obesity and socioeconomic problems. Although discrimination continues to persist, healthcare providers and social institutions must strive to take a stand for all overweight individuals, regardless of race or socioeconomic status.",

The normative, age-appropriate sleep needs during development remain undefined to a large extent. Furthermore, it remains crucial to realize that relations between sleep duration and cognition, effect, and health are all multi-directional. The most consistent result of insufficient or disrupted sleep is increased daytime somnolence. Thorough sleep history-taking by the healthcare provider and the use of objective sleep assessments are potential first steps and should include the five sleep variables (bedtime, rise time, total sleep duration, variability of sleep over time, and alignment of sleep with other circadian factors). We need to explore the beneficial effects of healthy sleep and how disrupted, shortened, or insufficient sleep may adversely impact on our children’s cognitive and affective functioning, may compromise their health, and may therefore impose a heavy price on our socio-economic structure.",

The objective existence of family relationships and the subjective sense of having someone to call on in need may increase the length of life a person expects by creating assurance about the future, by reinforcing healthy habits, and by improving current health. Using the 1995 Aging, Status, and Sense of Control representative sample of 2,037 Americans ages 18-95, we find that having adult children and surviving parents increases the length of life one expects, but young children in the home does not, and marriage only contributes years of life expected for older men. People expect to live longer when they report high levels of emotional support, and the association is mediated entirely by the perception that one has someone to call on when one is sick. People with informal health support expect to live longer than those without it, and this is especially true for persons with physical impairments. Although informal health practices shape subjective life expectancy, they explain little of the effects of supportive relationships. People who smoke, drink heavily, and have poor nutritional habits expect shorter lives, and those who walk and exercise expect longer lives. Better current health is associated with higher subjective life expectancy, but it does not explain the impact of supportive relationships. Most of the impact of supportive relationships appears to be a direct result of projected security about the future. Feeling that you have someone who would care for you if sick appears to increase the sense of security about surviving future health crises, thereby increasing one's perceived inventory of the essential property--life itself.",

The consequences of such reductions in fitness have often been presumed rather than estimated. Here we present a large body of evidence for a negative association between fitness and individual asymmetry. Significant correlations between morphological asymmetry and various fitness components do not demonstrate a causal relationship, and many potentially confounding variables may obscure attempts to unravel real relationships. Individuals with asymmetric phenotypes may be characterised by poor overall quality. For example, they may have experienced poor environmental conditions during their development, or they may have genotypes that make them less efficient in terms of growth, survival, or reproduction. Random experimental assignment of individuals to treatments will unravel the direct relationships between developmental instability and fitness components.",

Thus this paper addresses the important issue of gender differences in self-concept and global self-esteem in children. We found small differences in some domains of self-concept because women scored better in school competence and moral behavioral conduct than man. However, males scored higher athletic and social competence. Besides, it was found that physical appearance and behavioral conduct were significant predictors of global selfesteem in both men and women. Findings were related to possible explanations of why these differences were small at this stage of life compared to those detected in adolescence.\r\nKey Words\r\nSelf-concept, Self-esteem, Children",

      "title": "Declining performance of master athletes: silhouettes of the trajectory of healthy human ageing?",
      "abstract": "Analysis of world record performances by master athletes suggests an essentially linear decline with age until around the eighth decade after which performance decline accelerates. Because these records are obtained from highly trained individuals they can be viewed as being reflective of the diminution of integrative physiological prowess that occurs solely as a result of ageing, unaffected by the confounding effects of inactivity. It can also be argued that these performance profiles mirror and provide an insight into the trajectory of the physiology of the human ageing process. Here we propose a set point theory that hypothesises that a given threshold of physical activity is needed to age optimally and to maximise the 'healthspan'. Exercising at levels below the set point will result in ageing being contaminated by the unpredictable and pathological effects of inactivity. Exercise above this threshold stimulates adaptations towards maximising athletic performance, but is unlikely to have further beneficial effects on health. Thus the decades-long, controlled diminution in athletic performance, should not be seen as a disease process. The ageing process is separate from, and independent of, exercise-mediated processes that maintain or adapt physiological function. Whether an understanding of these mechanisms will also help uncover mechanisms underpinning the ageing process itself is open to question. However, any model which does not take into account the effects of activity will not adequately describe the inherent ageing process.",

These concepts are in fact related to the known phenomena of reactance and self-determination. Research on health resistance has contributed two central reasons for the deliberate disregard or dismissal of health messages by reasonable people: one, a different definition or interpretation of health and health maintenance (largely encompassing free-will ideas) and two, a suspicion of authority-driven science, medicine, and government-funded communication. These findings ask questions about a strict adherence to a particular idea of human health and life, and a particular format of communicating these ideas.",

Al estudiar la información epidemiológica de morbilidad y mortalidad disponible para hombres y mujeres, se encuentra que esta enmascara una gran parte de los problemas de mayor prevalencia e incidencia en ambos sexos, como por ejemplo, que las mujeres están expuestas a condiciones extremas de privación de recursos para desempeñar su doble o triple jornada diaria en muchas sociedades y que los hombres expresan una sobremortalidad por accidentes y violencia visible a lo largo de toda la vida, que está asociada estrechamente con actitudes y conductas estereotipadamente masculinas, tales como agresividad, intrepidez, osadía e ingestión excesiva de alcohol.

The rams have a juvenile (neotenic) period lasting 5 to 6 years after sexual maturation, during which they develop physically and mature behaviorally. Rams almost double in body weight after sexual maturation, increase their horn mass, grow darker in color, and lose the white fur on belly and legs, grow less gregarious, become more polished in the social behavior by increasing display patterns and reducing aggressive and sexual patterns, and act more \"brave\" with age. They reach ultimate development and maturation between 7 and 9 years of age. Females are paedogenic since they remain frozen in development at the level of sexually mature yearling rams. Females possess two behavioral states: in estrus they act like young males, but in anestrus they act like sexually immature sheep. Sheep attain strong sexual dimorphism as a consequence of the postpuberal growth of males. The slow behavioral maturation of rams, which is paralleled by physical development, suggests that the quantitative expression of social behavior is a factor of the rams' physical development; the quantitative similarities in behavior between young rams and estrous females suggest that this view is valid.",

      "abstract": "The reasons why adolescents resist the use of contraception are discussed. Some adolescents believe that their love is too ideal to be associated with the practical and mechanical nature of contraceptive use. Psychic stress can cause adolescents to refuse to use oral contraception. Fear of side effects can contribute to this refusal as can a feeling of rebellion against the family or society. Some adolescents feel that the purity of their motives is put in doubt if they take advance contraceptive precautions. Some refuse to use contraceptives to punish themselves for the consequences of their actions a type of masochism. Some adolescents who have not had family lives want to have children which they later abandon. Impulsiveness of fulfillment of sexual needs may prevent adolescents from using oral contraceptives. Adolescents are caught between being sensual and chaste and have difficulty in figuring out the consequences of their acts. Memories of infancy resurge in the minds of adolescents. Adults having experienced adolescence can have an important role to play in shaping the attitude of adolescents regarding contraception. They can perceive if the resistance to contraceptive use is normal or not and can work to give adolescents the means to make responsible decisions for themselves.",

This not uncommon concern is often expressed to pediatric endocrinologists who come into contact with these boys because of concerns with abnormal pubertal development. To explore the character and prevalence of these types of homosexual concerns we assessed the perceptions of a group of healthy adolescent males using a structured questionnaire. The aim of this study was to determine whether males concerned about homosexual tendencies manifest a unique self-perception profile or interact differently with others. A multi-item questionnaire regarding demographic, behavioral, psychological and sexual characteristics was administered to 52 18-24 year-old males. Overall, there were few differences between males admitting to an adolescent homosexual attraction to males and males without this attraction. Differences between these two groups included more exposure to some kinds of pornography (including male to male imagery), noticeable psychosexual responses to male pornography, internal questioning over homosexual tendencies, comparisons of genitalia and perceptions of body build. There were no differences in demographics, family structure, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, knowledge of puberty, inter-personal relationships or sources of information about sexuality.",

      "abstract": "For centuries men have sought a relationship between body form and function. In recent years investigators have been inclined to disregard the individual patient and focus attention on the micro-organisms responsible for his disease. But many individual differences in susceptibility remain unexplained. It is now thought that perhaps the solution of some of the problems in immunity lies in the recognition of certain anatomic and physiologic types or constitutions. Variations in anatomic and physiologic characteristics compatible with health must be defined to establish zones of normality. Most standards of health recognize only one zone as normal. In grading the physical fitness of the children of America, one certain weight for height and age is considered normal. Nutrition properly holds first place in judging the physical status of children. Comprehensive investigations in this field have been carried on by physicians, school nurses, dietitians and health and welfare agencies. A recent report",

      "abstract": "Motor skills are indispensable components of human physical activity, providing the possibility of specific efforts and, harnessing the functional potential of the body. Motor skills naturally develop to a certain level, depending on many factors, and are perfectible through practice. We believe that medium pupils’ motricity development is of paramount importance because it favourably influences the major functional indices and their volitional qualities. At the same time, it has an important role in proper and harmonious physical development, contributing to healthy growth. After puberty, which is characterized by significant and rapid somato-functional and psychomotor changes, there follows the stage of growth and development called the post-pubertal period, which is characterized by a slower rate of development and growth. The bone structure during this period is similar to that of the adult. Muscle mass also increases by 44.2% for girls. Body weight increases for both girls and boys. As children increase in age, they change as a result of growth and development processes which are subject to the laws of growth and the developmental stages. Growth refers to the quantitative aspect, whereas development is more qualitative. The two processes cannot be separated, because they are interconnected. Biological development consists of growth and physical maturity processes, changes of the internal biochemistry, and quantitative and qualitative alterations of the higher nervous activity.",

The author of the article viewed subjective trouble as a natural reaction of an intense or prolonged nature to a traumatic event. The ambiguity of the influence of subjective distress in life of an individual. Negative feelings, associated with subjective distress, are the necessary condition for maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of an individual. In addition, a sense of his own distress can be a source self-improvement, finding the meaning of life, self-realization. The analyzation of the phenomenon of subjective distress is presented and the factors of its formation are isolated. Based on a review of domestic and foreign researches, there are highlighted sociodemographic and psychological factors of subjective distress that are in complex interaction together. The article reveals statistically justified dependencies of subjective distress on various factors. There are established facts of a higher level of subjective distress in men, people with low levels of education, as well as with the increase in the age of the respondents, and more difficult experience of it in women. The interconnection of age and subjective well-being does not always have a unique connection. The obtained data allow concretizing understanding of subjective distress in individual social groups and justifying the need for targeted therapeutic and corrective work with persons characterized by a sense of distress.",

      "abstract": "Childhood obesity is increasingly prevalent in Western and non-Western societies. The authors related multiple dimensions of physical self-concept to body composition for 763 Chinese children aged 8 to 15 and compared the results with Western research. Compared with Western research, gender differences favoring boys were generally much smaller for physical self-concept and body image. Objective and subjective indexes of body fat were negatively related to many components of physical self-concept, but--in contrast to Western research--were unrelated to global self-esteem and slightly positively related to health self-concept. In support of discrepancy theory, actual-ideal discrepancies in body image were related to physical self-concept. However, consistent with the Chinese cultural value of moderation, and in contrast to Western results, being too thin relative to personal ideals was almost as detrimental as being too fat. The results reflect stronger Chinese cultural values of moderation and acceptance of obesity than in Western culture and have implications for social and educational policy in China.",

From a physical perspective, aging involves a loss of resilience or reserve capacity to respond to stressors, and this acquired vulnerability usually means that aging is associated with some greater susceptibility to illness as well as some decline in function over time. Nevertheless, the effects of aging are highly variable; some men and women are still running races at the age of 82, while others are frail and bed‐bound in a nursing home. In this brief overview, the physiology of aging in the major organ systems, what is known about the human life span, and different theories of aging are outlined.",

A los clasicos “ismos”  (clasismo, edaismo, racismo, sexismo) se anaden otros nuevos. Este articulo trata sobre uno de ellos: el lipoismo. La discriminacion por peso se da a traves de toda la trayectoria vital pero aumenta en algunos momentos del ciclo vital de manera significativa,  tambien es mayor  en  las  mujeres que  en  los hombres y tiene  una  especial importancia en  las  clases sociales mas desfavorecidas. Asi, algunos de los otros “ismos” culturalmente construidos redundan en el lipoismo.

Discrimination  against overweight people happens  all throughout one’s life but it is significantly more so at certain stages. This kind of discrimination is more prevalent among women than men and it has particular importance amongst the poorest social classes. In that sense, some of these other “isms” created based on culturalaspects result in “lipfobismo”. On the other hand, “lipofobismo” happens in interpersonal relationships (family, school,  work, and leisure)  and it is less  difficult es- cape from the stigma related to overweight. In this way, the devaluation caused by overweight and obesity perpetuates along one’s life and in other  existent abstract; nevertheless, determined risk factors.

Contrary to stereotypes that young people are more overconfident, the results provide little evidence that overestimation of one’s performance or overplacement of one’s performance relative to that of others is correlated with age. Instead, the results suggest that precision in judgment (confidence that one knows the truth) increases with age. This result is strongest for probabilistic elicitations, and not present in quantile elicitations or reported confidence intervals. The results suggest that a lifetime of experience, rather than leading to better calibration, instead may increase our confidence that we know what we’re talking about.",

The data are derived from 287 men living in downtown Atlanta. Applying and extending identity theory, we found support for the expectation that positive identity meanings, even a stigmatized identity such as being a homeless person, may provide support for a more general sense of self-esteem. Furthermore, homeless people can negotiate the subjective importance they attribute to the identity (homeless identity centrality) and the situations and social setting in which they invoke the identity (homeless identity salience). Findings reveal that lower homeless identity centrality increased self-efficacy but not self-worth, and homeless identity salience did not influence either self-worth or self-efficacy. Our study supports and extends the emerging recognition that homeless people do not passively, inevitably, and uniformly accept a deprecated and devalued sense of self.",

      "abstract": "A large number of biological, psycho-relational and socio-cultural factors are related to women's sexual health and they may negatively affect the entire sexual response cycle inducing significant changes in sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and satisfaction during the entire reproductive life span. In spite of the high prevalence of sexual problems with increasing age, sexual retirement is not an inevitable consequence of the passage of time and a high proportion of men and women remains sexually active well into later life, a result of changing attitudes toward sexuality and the availability of effective treatments for sexual dysfunction. Population-based studies reported an age-related decline of sexual functioning and an additional adverse effect of menopausal status. Ageing per se interferes with the level of sexual performance, but sexual behaviour of midlife and older women is highly dependent on several factors such as general physical and mental well-being, quality of relationship and life situation. Sex hormones, mainly low levels of estradiol, are relevant for the lack of sexual awareness and vaginal receptivity in naturally menopausal women. Even diminished levels of androgens, as it more frequently occurs in surgically menopausal women, has a negative impact on desire and sexual responsiveness. Several hormonal treatments have been used locally or systemically to alleviate sexual symptoms, especially by using estrogen plus androgen preparations and tibolone, with noticeable results on drive, enjoyment, lubrication, ability to reach orgasm and initiation of sex. However, sexual counseling and individualized management is mandatory to obtain meaningful and long-lasting results in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Religion may affect personal health in at least two ways. First, religious prescriptions concerning matters such as diet, waste, sexual relationships and social support networks may have actual health consequences. Second, religious healing practices may induce placebo and nocebo responses. Through such mechanisms, religion can result in both positive and negative health effects, depending on prescriptions and rituals involved. Contingent on magnitude, health effects may constitute an underestimated component in understanding the prevalence and persistence of religions in human societies. Health aspects of religion may have become important in human societies through natural selection of susceptibility to placebo responses from religious healing rituals, or through cultural selection of components of religions that involve functioning health advice or that have piggy-backed on practices invoking placebo responses. What exact significance health effects have for understanding the persistence and ubiquity of religions remains to be thoroughly investigated, however.",

      "title": "Annual Research Review: Prenatal stress and the origins of psychopathology: an evolutionary perspective",
      "abstract": "If a mother is stressed or anxious while pregnant her child is more likely to show a range of symptoms such as those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, aggression or anxiety. While there remains some debate about what proportion of these effects are due to the prenatal or the postnatal environment, and the role of genetics, there is good evidence that prenatal stress exposure can increase the risk for later psychopathology. Why should this be? In our evolutionary history it is possible that some increase in these characteristics in some individuals was adaptive in a stressful environment, and that this type of fetal programming prepared the child or group for the environment in which they were going to find themselves. Anxiety may have been associated with increased vigilance, distractible attention with more perception of danger, impulsivity with more exploration, conduct disorder with a willingness to break rules, and aggression with the ability to fight intruders or predators. This adaptation for a future dangerous environment may explain why stress and anxiety, rather than depression, seem to have these programming effects; why there is a dose–response relationship with prenatal stress from moderate to severe and it is not only toxic stress that has consequences; why not all children are affected and why individual children are affected in different ways; and why the outcomes affected can depend on the sex of the offspring. An evolutionary perspective may give a different understanding of children in our society with these symptoms, and suggest new directions for research. For example, there is some evidence that the type of cognitive deficits observed after prenatal stress have specific characteristics; these may be those which were adaptive in a past environment.",

      "abstract": "When large groups of grazing livestock which appear, superficially, to come from similar genetic and environmental backgrounds are offered a food supplement, some may not consume it, while others exhibit a wide range of intakes. Such variability in acceptance of supplements creates many practical problems. An animal usually exhibits neophobia when confronted by a novel food or new surroundings. The baseline level of neophobia is probably innately determined but is modifiied by an animal’s experiences. Continued exposure, particularly with others that eat that supplement (mothers, other adults or conspecifics) increases the naive animal’s motivation to sample and thereby learn about the supplement. In this way, nutritional wisdom gained by individuals in herds or flocks may be passed from one generation to the next. Once ingested, a supplement may elicit positive or negative metabolic stimuli that are collated by the central nervous system (CNS) thereby generating conditioned associations between characteristics of the supplement, e.g. flavours or other cues, and its post-ingestive effects on the CNS. Positive post-ingestive effects and suitable food cues generate a high ‘hedonic rating’ for that food in the animal. This rating is subject to modification whenever the supplement is ingested, as the animal’s requirements change in line with its changing physiological state, and as other alternative foods in the pasture become more or less available or nutritious. Non-acceptance of supplements by individual animals is apparently partly genetically determined by innate baseline neophobia and avoidance of certain food cues. Non-acceptance or lower intakes of a previously ingested supplement may result from alterations in the animal’s own energy or nutrient requirements with changing physiological state, or the presence of newly available foods that can be selected by the animal to give an alternative diet which better optimises the ‘costbenefit’ relationship. Reductions in supplement intake may also be due to food aversions formed via nonspecific negative stimuli that inadvertently become associated with food ingestion (e.g. created by disease),",

      "abstract": "The term sexual minority youth (SMY) encompasses youth who are not exclusively heterosexual. These are youth whose sexual orientations, identities, and/or behaviors are not exclusively heterosexual. Sexual identity is one’s personal identity as a sexual being, a label used in regard to oneself, such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “queer,” “pansexual,” or “asexual.”1 Sexual identity may not be indicative of sexual behaviors and, thus, understanding both identity and behavior are essential to providing excellent care— particularly as SMY youth often face health disparities.2 SMY youth, like their heterosexual peers, have strengths and vulnerabilities. Although the majority of sexual minority children and adolescents do well, they are likely to experience mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality at higher rates than their heteronormative peers.1,3 This phenomenon may be due to stigma, microaggressions, victimization, and/or discrimination regarding their sexual identities, which in turn effects overall health.4 In a 2013 survey performed by the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, 55% of sexual and gender minority youth surveyed stated that they felt unsafe at school due to perceived/experienced harassment from peers.5 This harassment can lead to an increase in suicidal ideation and attempts6 due to internalized shame and stigma, social isolation, and conflict about their identities. Microaggressions, stigma, and shame may also be experienced at home and in the community. Healthcare providers are in a unique position to support minority youth across multiple domains if they are aware and informed of social supports and experiences of conflict.",

During puberty, which starts the process of adolescence, adolescents are faced with the fact they have not chosen their body which sends them back to the experience of passivity of childhood. It arouses in the most vulnerable adolescents what remains of expectations or affective dependence regarding their family circle, and thus they are confronted with that basic human paradox, i.e. to be oneself one has to accept to receive and to feed upon others and at the same time to be different from them. Such a fear of being dependent on others may lead adolescents to deprive themselves of what they expect to receive from others. Sexuality and the body, through the emotions they summon, are particularly subject to aggressive or rejection behaviours which characterize that age.",

Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, this study accounts for differences between treated (i. e., those affected by a specific family event) and untreated participants since treatment and control groups differ with respect to several characteristics such as age, which may bias the results. Therefore, regression-adjusted matching is employed for each family event separately. This study, thus, takes steps towards disentangling causality from correlation. Overall, changes in family composition (such as moving together with or separating from the partner) impact the probability to start or quit smoking and lead to changes in body weight. In particular, smoking behavior and body weight are predominantly affected by forming or dissolving a household, rather than by marriage or divorce: cohabitation leads to weight gain; separation from a partner leads to weight loss, increased smoking initiation, and decreased smoking cessation.",

      "title": "The role of diet in managing menopausal symptoms: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Menopause is a natural stage that occurs when women stop menstruating, during which many women experience physical and psychological symptoms that can affect their quality of life and ability to work. Dietary modifications and food supplements may be explored by some women as alternatives to hormone replacement therapy, although existing reviews and expert position statements have given this limited consideration. This narrative review summarises the current evidence for dietary patterns, and botanical and food supplements, in the management of common menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flushes; night sweats), changes in bodyweight and composition, psychological symptoms (depression; anxiety; cognitive changes), sleep disturbances, joint pain, skin changes and urogenital symptoms. Soy isoflavones may reduce the frequency and/or severity of VMS, although results are inconsistent, and it is unclear whether dietary and supplemental sources have comparable effects. Adopting a healthier dietary pattern may support a healthy bodyweight and benefit VMS. However, evidence suggesting dietary patterns may benefit depression, anxiety, and cognition remains largely observational. While some botanicals, such as black cohosh and St John's Wort, have been reported in some studies to alleviate symptoms (such as VMS and depression), these are not currently recommended due to uncertainty about the appropriate dose and preparation, and potential safety concerns. Evidence for other symptoms is currently too limited to draw conclusions. While further trials at different menopausal stages are needed, adopting a healthier dietary pattern in accordance with dietary guidelines is likely to help support women's health before, during and after the menopausal transition.",

      "abstract": "The characteristics of sleep during puberty are discussed from the physiological aspect of hormone secretion and from the social aspect of reduced sleep time. Many types of hormones show an increased rate of secretion during sleep at night. Thus, sleep cannot simply be said to represent a stoppage of activities, and rather it comprises another form of 'activity.' During puberty, in par- ticular, the secretion of sexual hormones increases during sleep. Sleep is therefore assumed to play a role in promoting the maturation of sexual function. However, in Japan, the amount of sleep time that junior-high school students get has been on the decline. One of the factors contributing to this decline is that students are going to bed at increasingly later times. Students who go to sleep at late hours at night show a high incidence of problems, such as feeling unwell when they awake in the morning, being unable to consume breakfast, having irregular bowel movements, feeling drowsy during the day, and physically feeling they didn't get a sufficient amount of sleep at night, as well as other problems. Because the same group tends to show similar symptoms even during summer vacation when the number of hours of sleep increases, it is clear that this is not simply due to reduced sleep time. Accordingly, the increasingly later times at which they go to sleep must be recog- nized as a major problem.",

A measurement of relative fatness is a better criterion of caloric overnutrition than is body weight.The simple technique of skinfold measurement using established standard methods is the most practical for use in the field to obtain an estimate of fatness or caloric overnutrition. The current need is for the establishment of \"norms\" for skinfolds for population groups of all ages and both sexes. When these are established, excellent simple criteria for overnutrition will be available.Prior to the establishment of norms, more work is needed to indicate which skinfolds for each age group and for each sex best reflect total body fatness. Body fatness may then be studied in relation to body weight and both may be related to morbidity, mortality and longevity. Finally, the answer may be obtained to the question whether it is overweight per se or overfatness that is related to excess morbidity and mortality.",

The child who is small, i.e., below the tenth percentile in height and weight, is usually accepted without prejudice, but the one whose skeleton is maturing at a slightly slower rate than usual for his chronological age is often considered inferior. This attitude places an added, unfair burden on the small child. There seems to be no readily acceptable means of remedying this situation. Perhaps when the range in maturation of the skeletons of healthy children of the same age is better understood the stigma of retarded bone may be removed at least in part.

Die Häufigkeit von nicht-binären Geschlechtsidentitäten unter Menschen mit Transidentitäten im weitesten Sinne liegt bei um die 18%, bei Jugendlichen sogar bis zu 42%, und wurde lange unterschätzt. Unter den jungen Menschen mit Transidentität stellen trans Männer und nicht-binär orientierte Jugendliche, die bei Geburt noch dem weiblichen Geschlecht zugewiesen waren, besondere Risikogruppen dar mit einer sehr hohen Rate an ernsthaften Suizidgedanken von bis zu 68%. Ein hoher Leidensdruck für die Betroffenen nicht-binär orientierten Jugendlichen liegt in der erschwerten Identitätsfindung in einer Umgebung, welche eine klar männliche bzw. weibliche Identifikation als Norm fordert. Durch eine Verbesserung der Akzeptanz durch das Umfeld kann das Risiko für eine sekundäre Psychopathologie wie Depression und Suizidalität gesenkt werden. Neue Behandlungsansätze fordern nicht mehr die volle Identifikation mit dem »anderen Geschlecht« im Sinne einer Transsexualität nach ICD 10 als Voraussetzung für allfällige geschlechtsangleichende Behandlungen. Eine genaue Anamnese der Entwicklung der Geschlechtsidentität, der Kontinuität und eine Beobachtung des Verlaufes sind erforderlich, um eine Einschätzung über die Stabilität zu treffen.",

      "title": "[Gender inequality and reproductive health: a perspective for the program].",
      "abstract": "Research on the influence of the social, economic, and cultural context on reproductive health is just beginning in Mexico. Because health risks and damage appear to be associated with living conditions of the population, the mechanisms through which social inequality affects reproductive health should be analyzed. Gender inequality is of particular importance to the study of reproductive health. The construction of feminine identity, centered on motherhood and the ability to relate to others, has decisive consequences for self-esteem, social valuation, and the capacity of women to make decisions and act in their own self interest. The obstacles that women face in making decisions about sexuality and reproduction have psychological, affective, and health costs. Women living in contexts of limited female autonomy are often pressured into early pregnancy and union and to having large families. The need to satisfy expectations for their gender and social position, fear of being devalued or abandoned, and the desire to cement affective relationships may restrict their capacity to exercise their sexuality with autonomy and to separate it from procreation. The low rates of use of contraceptives by men and the almost exclusive focus on women of contraceptive technologies and programs also reflect the inequality of the sexes. The lesser access to resources and exercise of power by women in the household may lead to nutritional disadvantages, and societal standards that tolerate extramarital sexual activity for men but not for women leave women vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases. The health effects of gender inequalities are magnified by poverty and other forms of social disadvantage. The Program of Reproductive Health and Society aims to contribute to improved reproductive health in the Mexican population through study of the consequences of social and gender inequality.",

      "abstract": "The female menopause is considered to be a result of a decrease in the endocrinal metabolic activity of the ovaries. Although the male lacks such a highly visible sign as the cessation of the menstrual flow, the amount of testosterone produced by the aging male does in fact decrease. Recent studies, such as the Massachusetts Male Aging Study show that, between the ages of 40 to 70 years, the mean testosterone level decreases annually by about 1%. Chronic diseases and the use of drugs have a comparable effect. Although it is generally believed that sexual impotence is a major symptom of male menopause, recent investigations have shown that sexual functionability may be preserved into the ninth and tenth decade of life. Sexuality is not merely an instinct or a psychological expression, but is deeply anchored within the personality. Even when, with increasing age, the frequency of sexual dysfunction increases, such changes do not correlate with the decrease in testosterone levels. None of these phenomena take place within an age span that marks them off from the involution processes in other organs. The expression midlife crisis commonly met with in the English literature points up the psycho-social implications. Impotence or a loss of sexuality is not a sequel of aging, but of attitude towards sexuality. The latter is preserved if it is not neglected throughout the course of a lifetime.",

It is often suggested that sociocultural processes are the main cause of such widespread dissatisfaction. Here, we consider how perceptual effects may influence ideas of body normality and body ideals.Women who varied on a measure of body dissatisfaction rated a range of bodies for how normal and ideal they looked. They were exposed to either thin or fat bodies, and then they rerated the bodies.Women's perceptions of body normality and ideal were easily malleable by exposure. In addition, greater body dissatisfaction and internalization of the thin Western ideal were related to (i) a smaller most normal and ideal body, (ii) a greater discrepancy between the most normal and most ideal-rated body, and (iii) a reduced effect of exposure to fat bodies.Reduced updating of perceptions of body normality and body ideals in response to experience may be one mechanism that maintains body dissatisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Physical activity, mobility or patterned mobility (i.e., exercise) is intrinsic to the functioning of Homo sapiens, and required for maintenance of health. Thus, systems such as the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems appear to require constant reinforcement or conditioning to maintain integrity. Loss of conditioning or development of chronic deconditioning can have multiple consequences. The study of different types of deconditioning and their prevention or reversal can offer a number of clues to the regulation of these systems and point to how deconditioning poses risk for disease development and progression. From the study of deconditioning associated with spaceflight, a condition not predicted by evolution, prolonged bedrest, protracted sedentary behavior, as well as menopause and obesity and their consequences, provide a background to better understand human heterogeneity and how physical fitness may impact the risks for chronic conditions subsequent to the deconditioning. The effectiveness of optimized physical activity and exercise protocols likely depend on the nature of the deconditioning, the sex and genetics of the individual, whether one is addressing prevention of deconditioning-associated disease or disease-associated progression, and whether it is focused on acute or chronic deconditioning associated with different forms of deconditioning. While considerable research effort has gone into preventing deconditioning, the study of the process of deconditioning and its endpoints can provide clues to the regulation of the affected systems and their contributions to human heterogeneity that have been framed by the boundary conditions of Earth during evolution and the \"use it or lose it\" principle of regulation. Such information regarding heterogeneity that is elaborated by the study of deconditioning environments could enhance the effectiveness of individualized interventions to prevent deconditions or rescue those who have become deconditioned.",

Clinicians often compare the weight and height of children to explain an unimsually low or high measuremerit in an individual child.

Clinicians base their reassurance upon the assumption of a correlation of the processes that increase body mass and the processes which cause growth of the long bones and vertebrae in children. When the measurements fall in diverse percentiles, the clinician must explain his finding by identifying the same body type in the siblings and parents, must carry out later measurements to confirm normal inci-ements in both parameters, or must carry oitt further tests to rule out a pathological process. Attention to the relationship between measurements may yield further valuable information. lf the condition called health implies maximal rates of growth and maturation, and if each part of the organism participates in growth when nourishment is abundant or in compensation when there is insult or deficiency; then study of the relationship between measurements should help describe children or groups of children according to their general state of health.",

Kemampuan berkomunikasi dan penyesuaian diri yang baik dan efektif terutama sangat diperlukan oleh para remaja. Hal ini sesuai dengan salah satu tugas perkembangan masa remaja yang tersulit yaitu berhubungan dengan penyesuaian sosial. Masa remaja dikenal sebagai usia bermasalah, remaja dituntut berperilaku sesuai aturan kelompok, dimana aturan tersebut seringkali berbeda dengan cara, kebiasaan dan norma yang diterapkan oleh keluarga. Remaja harus cermat dalam membedakan yang benar dan salah. Aturan kelompok kadangkala memaksa sehingga remaja perlu berperilaku asertif untuk melindungi diri dari pergaulan yang tidak baik. Lebih dari 200 remaja perempuan meninggal setiap hari disebabkan komplikasi pengguguran, perilaku seks pranikah itu cenderung dilakukan karena pengaruh teman sebaya. Dari berbagai dampak yang ada dapat dilihat bahwa kerugian terbesar dialami remaja perempuan. Remaja perempuan kurang dapat berpikir logis disaat mendapat bujukan atau rayuan dari pacarnya, remaja perempuan juga perlu bersikap tegas terhadap bujukan atau pengaruh laki-laki untuk melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perbedaan asertifitas remaja ditinjau dari jenis kelamin.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif. Sampel penelitian adalah remaja yang berusia antara 14-15 tahun, sedang menempuh pendidikan di tingkat SMP kelas III berjumlah 120 orang yang di ambil dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Sedangkan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah skala likert yaitu skala perilaku asertif. Pengambilan data dilakukan pada tanggal 22 - 25 Februari 2011. Adapun metode analisis yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Independent sample t-test dengan program SPSS 13.00 for windows.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa ada perbedaan asertifitas remaja yang sangat signifikan ditinjau dari jenis kelamin, laki-laki (157.78) sedangkan perempuan (147.63). Hasil uji hipotesis menunjukkan t = 2.925; p = 0.004. Dengan demikian hipotesis di terima, hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang sangat signifikan asertifitas remaja laki-laki dan remaja perempuan. Dimana remaja laki-laki lebih asertif daripada remaja perempuan. Sedangkan pada tiap aspeknya, berdasarkan uji t-test diperoleh bahwa pada aspek mengungkapkan perasaan positif (t = 2.296; p = 0.023) menunjukkan adanya perbedaan yang signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan dalam mengungkapkan perasaan positif. Perbedaan yang sangat signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan terdapat pada aspek afirmasi diri (t = 2.810; p = 0.006) dan aspek mengungkapkan perasaan negatif (t = 3.178; p = 0.002).",

      "abstract": "Theological responses to gender variance that object to gender transition sometimes do so, as we have seen, for distinct moral or doctrinal reasons. Often, however, objections are more ethical and pragmatic, prompted, at least ostensibly, by concerns about health. Sometimes objectors suspect – in defiance of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the World Health Organization, and various mainstream therapeutic bodies – that gender dysphoria and/or a desire to transition gender are themselves pathological, pointing to underlying mental illness. Sometimes there are concerns that apparent gender dysphoria masks deeper underlying problems such that people who believe that they want to transition will actually be no better off afterwards than they were before. And there has been particular anxiety in recent years about an apparent mental health crisis amongst young people, which has coincided with higher numbers of young people (especially those assigned girls at birth) seeking transition. In this situation, it may be unclear whether gender dysphoria is something with its own independent reality or a side effect of mental health problems whose most appropriate treatments may not include support for transition. In this chapter and Chapter 9 I discuss health-related questions prompted by the existence and experiences of trans people, again in the context of reflection on limits. I ask whether support for transition is indeed always the most appropriate response to gender-variant identity; I deal, too, with some ethical questions such as whether it is justifiable to undergo interventions that will compromise fertility and whether transition-related interventions may justly be prioritized when finances and resourcing for healthcare are scarce.",

      "abstract": "There is little consensus about the meaning of the terms health disparities, health inequalities, or health equity. The definitions can have important practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups-such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination-systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (Social advantage refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category-e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group-and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.",

That is the and when one is obsessed with it, he soon develops the neurotic constitution--always determined to be the superior male, always tense and overbearing except when he is exhausted, and, of course, always subject to the physical symptoms that such a purgatorial life involves. When suspicion or accusation of inferiority leads to a protest in women, it is by no means always a masculine protest. An uncomfortable sense of inferiority is very common, indeed, with women. Its victims attribute it to a variety of causes. They care about all kinds of social relations; they want to be like other girls they admire; and their self-respect is not so steeped in thoughts of worthy masculinity that it is marked. The dominant thoughts and impulses of youthful human beings are more social than sexual, and their social ambitions are not all couched in terms of brute force.

It occurs with the decline in infectious diseases and the rise in cardiovascular diseases accounting for mortality. Male/female differences in morbidity are not as succinctly characterized. Men have a higher prevalence of lethal diseases, which is linked to their lower life expectancy. Women have more non-lethal conditions such as depression and arthritis; which may also be linked in part to longer survival. Men have better physical functioning and less disability which is partly explained by gender differences in diseases and also by their greater strength, size, and stamina. Gender differences in risk factors for disease have changed over time with the prevalence and treatment of risk as well as differential behavior by gender. Examination of what are seen as basic molecular and cellular measures related to aging indicates men age faster than women; however, even these basic biological measures result from a combination of biology, behavior, and social factors.",

We offer a social-cognitive account for these findings based on the individual experience of resource scarcity. In four studies (N = 1,176), we explored the possibility that this cross-cultural relationship emerges at the individual level; that is, we investigated whether situational feelings of resource scarcity predict personal preferences within a single culture. We operationalized intraindividual resource scarcity through feelings of financial and caloric dissatisfaction. Accordingly, we hypothesized—and found—that men who feel either poor or hungry prefer heavier women than men who feel rich or full. We discuss these findings in terms of how patterns of cross-cultural norms may be evinced at the individual level through an implicit psychological mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Categorization bias in social cognition is widely observed, as it is more beneficial to commit low-risk biases in order to reduce high-risk biases. In this context, a short age of the capacity to protect oneself when at high risk of approaching potentially harmful others, and hence, physical load and low physical fitness, are considered to be disadvantageous in self-protection. Thus, we hypothesized that a low capacity to self-protect leads to a biased social categorization of others as harmful. To examine this hypothesis, silhouettes of the human body, which had a sexually dimorphic cue (waist-to-hip ratio), were presented, and participants categorized the stimuli as female or male. Participants’ basic physical fitness was measured, and we manipulated physical load by a heavy or light backpack. Physical load did not significantly influence categorization. In contrast, only female participants tended to categorize the stimuli as male as basic physical fitness increased, suggesting that basic physical fitness, not physical load, affects sex categorization for females. Our findings shed new light on the effect of fitness factors on social cognition.",

      "abstract": "Although physical activity is linked to multiple health outcomes, a majority of Americans do not meet physical activity guidelines, often with precipitous declines among older adults. Marital quality is a less-explored, but important, factor that may influence physical activity, as spouses often influence each other's health behaviors.We use nationally representative panel data to investigate whether positive and negative dimensions of marital quality influence physical activity, and whether age and gender moderate these relationships.We find that both marital support and strain are related to higher odds of more frequent active exercise and walking, pointing to the complex influence of marital quality. Marital support became increasingly important to higher levels of walking frequency as men aged.This study provides new information on the ways in which both positive and negative dimensions of marital quality may contribute to trajectories of physical activity across the life course.",

Across a broad range of indicators, men report poorer health than women. Although men in all socioeconomic groups are doing poorly in terms of health, some especially high-risk groups include men of low socioeconomic status (SES) of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, low-SES minority men, and middle-class Black men. Multiple factors contribute to the elevated health risks of men. These include economic marginality, adverse working conditions, and gendered coping responses to stress, each of which can lead to high levels of substance use, other health-damaging behaviors, and an aversion to health-protective behaviors. The forces that adversely affect men’s health are interrelated, unfold over the life course, and are amenable to change.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who are socially connected are happier and healthier than their more isolated counterparts. Over the past few decades, researchers have established that both the quantity and quality of our social relationships are unequivocally important when it comes to our physical and mental health, and our risk of mortality. Although the link between social relationships and mental health is well established in a couple, we have only just begun to identify explanations for this link. Recently, social scientists have discovered that the link between social relationships and health is explained by our behaviours (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet), various psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, mental health, cultural norms), and physiological processes. Aggression in marital relationship is defined as a manipulative, physical or non-physical form of aggression meant to negatively impact the development of relationship by social exclusion or harming the social status of a victim by spreading or behaving negatively. Research findings suggest that even infrequent experiences with relational aggression victimization are associated with lower subjective well-being such as depression, loneliness, and positive affect. This case study investigates the existence of relational aggression in a couple and the relationship between relational aggression and own subjective well-being. The participant in the study is married and from nuclear family. The study tries to investigate aggression level through the case study method and relaxation, yoga, meditation techniques used which was used to resolve the aggression and helps to achieve well being.",

Inclusive fitness is an individual's own fitness plus those of its kin discounted by the coefficient of relatedness. Altruism (phenotypes that increase the fitness of others at a cost to the bearer's own fitness) may persist in a population if the inclusive fitness of altruism is greater than that of nonaltruistic alternative phenotypes. Evolution by natural selection is the inevitable consequence of variation in the relative fitness of different phenotypes. Because resources are finite and higher fitness can come at substantial cost to individual self‐maintenance, there are no necessary relationships between fitness and measures of individual well‐being or energy efficiency. Life‐history theory provides a framework for generating testable hypotheses regarding the impact on fitness of trade‐offs between allocating resources and time to reproduction or to somatic maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Human sexuality has three main roots: biological, motivational-affective-relational, and cognitive. Unfortunately, in women, the biological dimension is usually disregarded. Hormones are necessary, but not sufficient, factors to maintain a satisfying human libido. In women, oestrogens prime the central nervous system, acting as neurotrophic and psychotrophic factors throughout life. They also prime the sensory organs, including the skin with its sebaceous and sweat glands, which are the key receptors for external sexual stimuli. Oestrogens are also the ‘permitting factors’ for the action of vaso-intestinal peptide, the key neurotransmitter involved in the endothelial and vascular changes leading to vaginal lubrication. Other factors, such as medication, alcohol and other health problems, can modify the biological impact of hormones on libido. Depression may cause a progressive decline in interest in sexual behaviour leading to low libido, difficulty in sexual arousal, secondary anorgasmia and/or frank sexual aversion. Increasing attention of doctors towards the sexual problems of women will dramatically improve female quality of life, especially during difficult periods Of transition.",

Unlike alcohol or drug abuse, suppression of sexual behavior is not an option, only compulsive character must be suppressed in order to allow a full and satisfying sexuality. The purpose of this observation is to explore the psychological and physical consequences of sexual addiction. We report the case of a patient with sexual addiction, in order to describe the impact of this addiction on his psychological and physical health. Mr. JG is 28 a years old man, he has no particular habits and no significant pathological history. He was addressed by his general practitioner for \"excessive masturbation\". His sexual history is characterized by: - An excessive interest in pornographic films since the age of 13, - An extremely rich fantasy life, - Frequent compulsive masturbation, going up to ten times a day. Through the years, this hyper sexuality has become more important, and masturbation more frequent, which resulted in: - Permanent feeling of embarrassment and shame, - Ideas permanently focused on sexual thoughts, - Fatigue and chronical physical exhaustion, - Constant muscle pain and headache, diminished visual acuity. - Relationship difficulties, and social maladjustment, - Depression and suicidal thoughts. The evaluation by the Carnes scale found a score of 16/25, which corresponds to a severe sexual addiction. The boundary between normal and pathological depends on the models and taboos of society, but for physicians, the major criteria for sexual addiction are mental suffering, social maladjustment, and demand of care.",

      "abstract": "Growth is defined as an increase of size over time with time usually defined as physical time. Yet, the rigid metric of physical time is not directly relevant to the internal dynamics of growth. Growth is linked to maturation. Children and adolescents differ in the tempo at which they mature. One calendar year differs in its meaning in a fast maturing, and in a slow maturing child. The slow child needs more calendar years for completing the same stage of maturity. Many characteristics in the human growth curve are tempo characteristics. Tempo - being fast or slow maturing - has to be carefully separated from amplitude - being tall or short. Several characteristic phenomena such as catch-up growth after periods of illness and starvation are largely tempo phenomena, and do usually not affect the amplitude component of growth. Applying Functional Data Analysis and Principal Component Analysis, the two main sources of height variance: tempo and amplitude can statistically be separate and quantified. Tempo appears to be more sensitive than amplitude to nutrition, health and environmental stress. An appropriate analysis of growth requires disentangling its two major components: amplitude and tempo. The assessment of the developmental tempo thus is an integral part of assessing child and adolescent growth. Though an Internet portal is currently available to process small amounts of height data (www.willi-will-wachsen.com) for separately determining amplitude and tempo in growth, there is urgent need of better and practical solutions for analyzing individual growth.",

      "title": "Older Adults Acceptability of Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Engagement in recommended levels of physical activity decreases dramatically with age, despite many health and social benefits. Effective implementation of physical activity services for older adults requires that such provision is acceptable to them. Older adults living in deprived areas, where lack of resources can result in unmet basic needs, are twice as likely to be inactive as those in more affluent areas, suggesting lower levels of acceptability of leisure time physical activity. Older adults with lower socioeconomic status also experience greater barriers to physical activity yet are often omitted from research. \nAcceptability is often conceptualised as the level of tolerance required to undertake health behaviours in order to gain future health-related benefits. As many older adults may view physical activity as irrelevant, a waste of limited resources, or a luxury that only the well, or well-off, can indulge in, an alternative approach may be more fitting. The term acceptability can also be used to denote how attractive health behaviours are perceived to be to the target audience, and whether or not they are actively sought out. When viewed through this lens, physical activity may be seen as an enjoyable way to spend time connecting with others, whilst still reaping the many benefits for health and wellbeing. \nThis PhD aimed to address the gap in knowledge on the role acceptability of physical activity plays in the engagement in physical activity by older adults and to explore the impact of socioeconomic factors on such acceptability. A meta-synthesis was conducted to identify underlying reasons older adults have for wanting to engage in physical activity (or not). Few data were found from low socioeconomic status areas. The impact of providers views on acceptability were rarely considered in the literature. A multi-perspective interview study was therefore conducted within low socioeconomic status areas to explore acceptability of physical activity in this context. Views on what made physical activity acceptable to older adults (with reasons for such acceptability) were elicited both from older adults in low socioeconomic status areas and from providers of physical activity programmes in these locations. This study resulted in two papers, one published paper on the conflation of time and energy from the older adults' perspective, and one paper (in preparation) on the wider multi-perspective views of older adults and providers on the acceptability of physical activity. A published book chapter giving an overview of how to implement these findings to make physical activity interventions more acceptable to older adults completes this research. \nFocusing on fun and enjoyment rather than long-term health outcomes within physical activity services does appear more acceptable to many older adults. Actively encouraging socialising by providing time and space around and within physical activity increases the value to many and may be particularly important in deprived areas where there may be limited other opportunities for socialising. Providers may need to think outside their remit or work collaboratively with those from other sectors to achieve this multi-functional physical activity/social provision in order to encourage older adults in deprived areas into what could otherwise be an unfamiliar concept, leisure time physical activity. Encouraging socialising within physical activity can be an effective use of limited resources, increasing acceptability of physical activity as a by-product of satisfying highly valued social needs.",

      "abstract": "Popular health discourses on obesity tend to highlight the negative impacts of excess weight. Obesity, however, also has the effect of ranking and stationing individuals in the neoliberal health paradigm as unhealthy, immoral, and undesirable. The effects of obesity discourses can be prominently observed in gay men’s culture where muscular, white, thin bodies are glorified. This paper employs a feminist poststructural framework to examine how desired bodies are constituted in gay culture, the effects this has on gay men’s experiences of food and exercise, and resistance within gay culture to dominant obesity discourses. A review of the literature on obesity, gay culture, gay men’s health, body image and eating practices was undertaken to inform this work. Various studies have shown that the views within gay culture on fat bodies result in feelings of body dissatisfaction, rejection, and isolation for many men, especially for those that fall outside the privileged version of male bodies or who are labelled as ‘obese’. A critical review of the literature will explore how these experiences are produced through the sexualized culture of gay men.",

      "title": "Evidence and Implications From a Natural Experiment of Prenatal Androgen Effects on Gendered Behavior",
      "abstract": "Sex and gender are key to people's lives, and are the focus of scientific and popular interest and controversy. Sex-related psychological characteristics reflect more than socialization; they are influenced by sex hormones present during sensitive periods of development, particularly prenatal androgens. Studies of females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) show how prenatal androgens affect behavior across the life span, with large effects on gendered activity interests and engagement, moderate effects on spatial abilities, and relatively small (or no) effects on gender identity, gender cognitions, and gendered peer involvement. In addition to showing the complexity of androgen effects on gendered behavior, studies of females with CAH provide an opportunity to test theories of gender development, understand how nature and nurture work together, and examine mechanisms of development. The implications of this work have often been misunderstood, so we consider what it means - and does not mean - for biology to influence gender-related behavior.",

      "abstract": "Body image disturbance – a cause of distress amongst the general population and those diagnosed with various disorders – is often attributed to the media’s unrealistic depiction of ideal bodies. These ideals are strongly gendered, leading to pronounced fat concern amongst females, and a male preoccupation with muscularity. Recent research suggests that visual aftereffects may be fundamental to the misperception of body fat and muscle mass – the perceptual component of body image disturbance. This study sought to establish the influence of gender on these body aftereffects. Male and female observers were randomly assigned to one of four adaptation conditions (low‐fat, high‐fat, low‐muscle, and high‐muscle bodies) and were asked to adjust the apparent fat and muscle levels of male and female bodies to make them appear as ‘normal’ as possible both before adaptation and after adaptation. While neither the gender of observers nor of body stimuli had a direct effect, aftereffect magnitude was significantly larger when observers viewed own‐gender (compared with other‐gender) stimuli. This effect, which may be due to attentional factors, could have implications for the development of body image disturbance, given the preponderance of idealized own‐gender bodies in media marketed to male and female consumers.",

      "title": "Achieving Diagnostic Certainty in Resource-Limited Settings",
      "abstract": "Disorders of sex development are complex disorders with atypical chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex. Decision making in relation to sex assignment has been perceived as extremely disturbing and difficult for families and healthcare professionals. This is mainly due to a general paucity of information about the condition, lack of advanced diagnostic settings, and an exaggerated feeling of stigma and shame associated with genital abnormalities. Lack of accurate healthcare information and reporting results in poor knowledge about the exact incidence and impact of these disorders in resource-poor countries. Lack of neonatal screening facilities for congenital adrenal hyperplasia often results in delayed diagnosis of these disorders and perhaps a higher number of deaths, especially in male children who lack ambiguity of genitalia. Technically more sophisticated investigations are often not available or affordable, posing further difficulties in establishing a diagnosis. Limited resources also include the lack of availability of adequately trained personal. Thus, the establishment of the recommended and necessary multidisciplinary team is often hard to accomplish in these countries. This seriously compromises the ability to manage these children properly. Finally, countries in places like Southeast and Far East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are often accompanied with their unique cultural and social issues, filled with myths and misconceptions, which worsens the already complex situation. Thus, a huge limitation exists in dealing with these children with disorders that are complex to diagnose and manage, even in countries with advanced and well-equipped medical facilities.",

The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate differences between atheists and theists regarding the perceived impact of metaphysical beliefs (belief or nonbelief in the existence of God) on their personality traits. Participants consisted of undergraduate students enrolled in a psychology course (N = 551, ages 18–29, 71.8% female) at a large public university in the southern US. Compared to theists, atheists viewed their metaphysical beliefs as contributing less to their positive traits and as making them less traditional/conservative and more non-traditional/liberal. Atheists indicated that having the opposite metaphysical beliefs would make them less non-traditional/liberal and more traditional/conservative; however, there was no difference in the perception of the possible impact of holding the opposite beliefs on positive traits. These results suggest that individuals’ metaphysical beliefs may relate to the way they understand themselves. Implications for working with atheists in clinical settings are discussed.",

Current evidence suggests that reducing sedentary time may be beneficial to older adults and allow them to better maintain their functional capacity and autonomy, but more research is needed to enable the development of evidence-based behavioral goals that will improve health outcomes. There is also a need to consider sedentary behavior from an organizational and societal perspective that moves beyond workplace and school settings to be inclusive of older adults, the fastest growing population in the world.",

Important life events such as pregnancy, separating from a long-term partner or experiencing violence are also associated with body modifications.

We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy of evolutionary significance.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the\"winds of fate\" control one's destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and \"behavior\"—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,\"psychological factors,\" including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are \"cited in selected sources\" in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the\"social ecology\" of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if\"teachers paid more attention to students\" and if \"we were not treated like inmates.\"Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The \"best\" schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by\"ability\" has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as \"below average\" can have a tremendously negative effect on students' self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are \"scared straight\" or\"moralized to\" almost always fail. The question should be: \"How do schools fail adolescents?\" rather than \"How do adolescents fail school?\"Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can \"functional disorders\" such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on \"street value.\"Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and \"coaching\"surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent's problems being viewed as \"characterologic disorders\" rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual's achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as \"slow learners.\" They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including \"high-functioning autism,\"Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one's temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one's own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more \"medical model\"diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent's behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the \"patient\" where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD\"triad\") can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent's consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good \"learning hygiene\"; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the“winds of fate” control one’s destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and “behavior”—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,“psychological factors,” including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are “cited in selected sources” in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the“social ecology” of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if“teachers paid more attention to students” and if “we were not treated like inmates.”Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The “best” schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by“ability” has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as “below average” can have a tremendously negative effect on students’ self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are “scared straight” or“moralized to” almost always fail. The question should be: “How do schools fail adolescents?” rather than “How do adolescents fail school?”Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can “functional disorders” such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on “street value.”Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and “coaching”surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent’s problems being viewed as “characterologic disorders” rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual’s achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as “slow learners.” They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including “high-functioning autism,”Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one’s temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one’s own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning.

Some studies about usability and, however, among the various aspects to be explored, there is the need anthropometric adaptation for this product. The shoes must have own size and own shape to the reality of ergonomic in shoes designing have been developed in Brazil different population categories, such as the population of obese people, which has a greater physical burden on lower limbs extremities and therefore it’s more prone to the occurrence or worsening of diseases in this region. There are few researches about anthropometry of obesity and there are no ones that specifically deal data related to the size of these individuals’ lower limbs extremities. It’s important to note that this population is growing up in the whole world last years, which demands the development of specialized products, from more accurate ergonomic criterion. Therefore, this study aims to achieve an anthropometric survey of nonobese and obese individuals’ lower limbs extremities, using systematic methodological procedures, allowing analyzing the differences between these individuals. Data on perceptions of comfort was collected using shoes and 30 anthropometric variables of 84 adult people’ lower limbs extremities, divided into 42 obese and 42 non-obese patients of both genders. The results affirm that both compared population have difficulties to buy shoes, and also that they feel uncomfortable to use them. About anthropometric variables, 17 showed statistically significant difference, particularly in the dimensions related to circles. Thus it demonstrates the real need of the application of ergonomic design and anthropometric data of obese people in the modeling and designing shoes.

      "title": "Real World High-Risk Patterns Associated with Internet Addictive Behaviors",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe use of the concept of risk has been primarily biomedical, reflecting a concern for adverse outcomes related to morbidity and mortality. The epidemiological research has concentrated to locate agents or conditions that are associated with an increased probability of outcomes that compromise health, quality of life, or life itself. More recently the concept has expanded into the domain of behavior, underlying the importance of high-risk behavior patterns in the development or deterioration of clinical disorders and illnesses.Overall the empirical evidence supports the existence of organized patterns of adolescent risk behaviors. These patterns taken together probably reflect an adolescent's way of being in the world. Their organization raises questions about the origin or source of the covariation and patterning. The answer probably lays part in the social ecology of adolescent life, an ecology that provides socially organized opportunities to learn risk behavior together and normative expectations and part in the fact that different risk behaviors can serve the same functions. Considerable research has shown that adolescent risk behaviors are functional, purposive, instrumental and goal- directed and that these goals are often central to normal adolescent development. Smoking, drinking, illicit drug use, risky driving or early sexual activity can be instrumental in gaining peer acceptance and respect; in establishing autonomy from parents; in repudiating the norms and values of conventional authority; in coping with anxiety, frustration and anticipation of failure or in affirming maturity and marking a transition out of childhood and toward a more adult status (1).Internet addiction is a newly emerged behavior problem in adolescents and it is proposed to be included to previously defined behavioral problems. According to problem behavior theory1, use of alcohol, smoking, and illicit substance use, have been grouped as problem behaviors, which have the same psychosocial proneness including the variables of social environment, perceived environment, personality, and behavior. These variables serve either as instigations for engaging in problem behavior or controls against involvement on problem behaviour. It is suggested that the balance between instigations and controls determines the degree of proneness for problem behaviour. The overall level of proneness reflects the degree of psychosocial conventionality- unconventionality characterised each adolescent.The concepts that constitute the perceived- environment system include social controls, models, and support. Problem behavior proneness in the perceived environment system includes low parental disapproval of problem behavior, high peer approval of problem behavior, high peer models for problem behavior, low parental controls and support, low peer controls, low compatibility between parent and peer expectations, and low parent (relative to peer) influence.The concepts that constitute the personality system include a patterned and interrelated set of relatively enduring, sociocognitive variables-values, expectations, beliefs, attitudes, and orientations toward self and society-that reflect social learning and developmental experience. Problem behavior proneness in the personality system includes lower value on academic achievement, higher value on independence, greater social criticism, higher alienation, lower self-esteem, greater attitudinal tolerance of deviance, and lower religiosity.The concepts that constitute the behavior system include both problem behaviors and conventional behaviors. Problem behaviors include alcohol use, problem drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, other illicit drug use, general deviant behavior (delinquent behaviors and other norm-violative acts), risky driving, and precocious sexual intercourse. Involvement in any one problem behavior increases the likelihood of involvement in other problem behaviors due to their linkages in the social ecology of youth-with socially organized opportunities to learn and to practice them together-and to the similar psychological meanings and functions the behaviors may have. …",

It requires a complex series of hormonal changes initiated by alterations in hypothalamic regulatory mechanisms that are incompletely understood, culminating in gonadal sex steroid secretion and associated maturation. While genetics play a major role in the timing and progression of pubertal maturation, other inputs such as nutrition, environmental factors, and social milieu yield individualized variations in the maturational pattern. It is likely that these factors are in part responsible for changes in timing and tempo of pubertal maturation noted over the last few decades. When a child begins to mature at the earliest or latest extremes of the normal ranges, the clinician must determine if the child is undergoing normal puberty, a non-pathologic variation, or a medically concerning condition that requires further investigation or treatment.",

      "abstract": "N C Med J. September/October 2010, Volume 71, Number 5 When one looks at many preventive health practice norms, one might conclude that North Carolina has a unique “health care personality.” The norms in North Carolina do not quite fit with regional norms in the southeastern United States, nor do they align with those of the Mid-Atlantic states. North Carolina’s attitudes, trends, and practices related to the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding are no exception. North Carolina has a special set of issues that affect trends and practices in breastfeeding and vary across the state. Breastfeeding is sometimes referred to as the “homeless intervention.” It has no commercial home. It is neither entirely a women’s issue nor entirely a children’s issue. Breastfeeding is not a one-time thing, like an immunization or a pill; rather, it demands a 24/7 commitment on the part of new parents who have many things to learn. However, it is a mistake to think of breastfeeding as simply a lifestyle choice. In the United States, we once considered avoidance of smoking, use of a seat belt or a bike helmet, and regular exercise to be lifestyle choices with no real public health impact. However, we have been persuaded by data on health and survival, as well as by the social and health care costs of nonadherence to public health recommendations, to value these preventive health behaviors and to support them with social marketing campaigns, insurance incentives, and even laws to increase acceptance and to promote behavior change. These considerations also apply to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is a vital preventive health practice and an issue for all who care about health, whether from a clinical, business, or personal viewpoint. The support, or lack thereof, for breastfeeding has measurable implications in terms of lifelong health and wellness for North Carolinians.",

      "abstract": "Health and happiness influence each other. However, the relationship is quite complex, as a healthy person may be unhappy, and a seriously ill patient may experience happiness. Physical and mental health, and illness-related variables impact upon happiness, though it may be more pronounced by mental illnesses. Positive emotions, resilience, sex and intimacy, and social connectedness are usually associated with happiness, whereas stress, worry, pain, and depression are not. Happier people probably live longer, and there is excess mortality associated with unhappiness; however, many confounding variables exist. Interestingly, in recent years, biological substrates for happiness have been suggested. Genetics, neurotransmitters, specific areas of the brain, and biomarkers have been identified as being associated with the states of happiness. Achieving and maintaining happiness through health appears to have simple messages of being physically active, maintaining good health, preventing and managing illnesses well, having positive emotions, learning to be resilient against stress, and being generous and spiritual. Studies on health and happiness are building up in recent years, providing more insights into their interrelation. Happiness is being used as an outcome measure in clinical interventional trials and other health research, and there is an enhanced scope for its use in common clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on neoliberal discourses of health, “obesity,” and disability by analyzing pregnancy biopedagogies, specifically maternal “obesity,” through United States government agencies and public health campaigns warning against fat pregnancy. This discourse constructs fat women as irresponsible mothers and deficient citizens who put their bad habits ahead of their unborn children’s health. Focusing on pre-pregnancy weight essentializes women, reducing them to their reproductive capacities and exposing them to increased state interference in their reproductive choices. Conceptualizing health as risk avoidance seeks a future in which fatness and neurodiversity do not exist. I propose cripping and fattening time as possible remedies for this erasure. Reconceptualizing time allows fat people to live in the present without prescriptive cures to achieve normativity. Fat time and crip time challenge the capitalist logic that the only desirable bodies and minds are lean, intelligent, fast, independent, and productive. Instead, these non-normative temporalities provide a slower and more sprawling experience of time and offer an expansive understanding of what minds and bodies are expected to do and be.",

      "abstract": "What increases and decreases WB, and for how long? Consuming more? Not so much—for long. I dive into the relationship between income and WB, including the Easterlin Paradox. While your income and consumption play a role, their roles are not huge once basic needs are met. So, to identify the influence of a change in income on emotional WB or life-satisfaction WB, one must separate out the effects of age, health, social institutions, gender, equality, genetics, personality, and relationships. And how long do WB shifts last? Our WB depends on our relative position, relative to others and to our former selves. [In my department, a raise that was dollar small but bigger than what others got seemed preferred to more dollars but fewer than what others got. And no one desires to make less than their brother-in-law.] Comparing to our former selves could explain why a loss of income decreases our WB more than a previous raise increased it. We compare on many dimensions besides income. Think about the loss of White privilege. I end with other theories of WB: you have a set point from which it is difficult to deviate from for long, WB is created not by consuming but by the right kind of doing, WB is driven by our relationships, and increasing WB is most easily achieved by reducing unnecessary ill-being (suffering).",

However, their social clock often deviates from the biological clock (e.g., having to get up earlier than one’s natural wake-up time for work or study, having to stay up to work night shifts or meet a project deadline)—a phenomenon known as “social jetlag.” How does social jetlag impact consumer behavior? Using field data and experiments, we show that social jetlag decreases conspicuous consumption because consumers experiencing social jetlag are less interested in social interaction. This effect is weakened when social interaction occurs among familiar others rather than strangers, when conspicuous consumption does not draw social attention, and when consumers expect to use a luxury product in a private setting.",

Clear cases of coercion, for example, involve the threat of significant physical harm. But what should we say about cases involving the threat of harms that are relatively insignificant or that involve no physical harm at all? Impersonating someone’s spouse to trick them into saying yes to sex is clearly seriously wrong, but what about the more mundane kinds of lies people tell when they’re trying to meet someone? It’s wrong to have sex with someone who says yes when they’re so drunk they’re about to pass out and not wrong if they say yes after having a few sips of beer. What, though, should we say about the more difficult cases in the middle where it’s genuinely unclear whether they’ve had too much to drink? What’s the most reasonable view about other forms of incompetent consent to sex, like those involving young children, elderly dementia patients, or people born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments? And what about cases of problematic sexual consent that don’t involve coercion, deception, or incompetence at all? Can a patient give valid consent to sex with their therapist? Can the offer of a large amount of money in exchange for sex invalidate the sexual consent the offer elicits? This book addresses these and related questions.",

Inequality is exacerbated when one party (the perpetrators) have more control over the victim. This control can be resources, including knowledge, economy and public acceptance (social status / social modalities). It also includes controls that appear on the form of patron-client relationship or feudalism, such as the parent-child, employer-worker, teacher-student, community leaders-residents and armed groups / forces-the civilian population. Violence against children is everything that made the child tortured, both physically, psychologically mental maupu. Violence against children is an act of abuse or maltreatment of children in the form of physical abuse, emotional, sexual, neglect of care and exploitation for the benefit of commercial real or even not to harm the health, survival, dignity and development, violence derived from the responsible, trustworthy and powerful in the protection of the child.

Significant levels of assortative marriage have been found in both verbal and performance IQ, personality ‘inconsistency’, stature, weight and some other bodily dimensions. Their nature has been analysed by time of marriage, birthplace and social class, all of which appear to have marked effects. On the other hand, length of courtship and distance apart of the partners' residences at marriage seem to be more or less inconsequential.",

This form of impression management may change during ontogeny as children become increasingly sensitive to others. To examine whether self-conscious emotions are influenced by audience presence across the lifespan, we induced embarrassment and pride in n=71 3.5-5-year-old children, n=71 8-10-year-old children, and n=73 adults, either in the presence of an audience or alone. We measured nonverbal expressions of emotion, physiological arousal, and self-reports. All participants reported more embarrassment and blushed more while watching their performance in the presence of others. However, participants’ pride was not contingent on audience presence and differed across age, with adults showing the most nonverbal expressions of pride. These results elucidate how social environments shape how we feel and express emotions across development.",

The practice of nutritional health will ensure the best possible outcome during the process of growing older. Exercise and physical fitness, likewise, will also foster health and quality of life. Healthy adequate sleep will foster longevity and particularly the optimal use of our waking hours. We are not healthy unless our sleep is healthy.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly Americans who live with people under age 18 have lower life evaluations than those who do not. They also experience worse emotional outcomes, including less happiness and enjoyment, and more stress, worry, and anger. In part, these negative outcomes come from selection into living with a child, especially selection on poor health, which is associated with worse outcomes irrespective of living conditions. Even with controls, the elderly who live with children do worse. This is in sharp contrast to younger adults who live with children, likely their own, whose life evaluation is no different in the presence of the child once background conditions are controlled for. Parents, like elders, have enhanced negative emotions in the presence of a child, but unlike elders, also have enhanced positive emotions. In parts of the world where fertility rates are higher, the elderly do not appear to have lower life evaluations when they live with children; such living arrangements are more usual, and the selection into them is less negative. They also share with younger adults the enhanced positive and negative emotions that come with children. The misery of the elderly living with children is one of the prices of the demographic transition.",

Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

      "abstract": "Masculine men are more likely to idealise being tall, muscular, and lean. Feminine men, on the other hand, are more likely to idealise leanness. At the trait level, masculinity and femininity have been linked with an unhealthy striving for these idealised traits and body dissatisfaction. However, it is unclear how feeling masculine or feminine in the moment might be associated with body satisfaction. Is feeling masculine and/or feminine associated with a boost in body satisfaction? In the first large-scale experience sampling study of masculinity and femininity (nobservations=25,133; Nparticipants=530), we find that state masculinity and femininity, but not trait, are associated with increased body satisfaction among sexual minority men. We also find a gender congruence effect whereby the positive associations between state masculinity/femininity on body satisfaction are more pronounced when these feelings align with trait levels of masculinity/femininity. Exploratory analyses revealed a moderating effect of eating disorder history. The associations between masculinity and femininity on body satisfaction were amplified for people who had been diagnosed with an eating disorder. This study presents the first evidence that the links between masculinity and femininity and body satisfaction can be delineated based on whether they are measured as traits or states.",

The difference between learning and development is neither simple nor self-evident, yet the implications that follow from a commitment to one or the other are considerable. Development is usually construed as an unfolding, the impassive evolution of “being.” Children develop physically, cognitively, emotionally almost in spite of themselves; they may not develop to their full potential, and they may require massive environmental support, but even in cases of benign neglect, children will normally become taller, smarter, and more stable. Learning implies a measure of control and responsibility. It depends on experience and on the availability of resources: conceptual, social, intellectual, and so on.",

Desde el año 2000 hasta la actualidad, el ideal de cuerpo femenino consiste también en mantener una complexión delgada, pero resaltando el área muscular del busto, glúteos, abdomen y muslos. Es por eso que la mujer actual intenta alcanzar este ideal de cuerpo femenino de distintas maneras, que pueden poner en riesgo la salud física y mental. Por un lado, manipula las fotografías que comparte en las redes sociales; y por otro, sigue distintas dietas de moda que no cumplen con las características de una alimentación correcta, o peor aún, adopta conductas alimentarias de riesgo.

It describes the character and pace of bodily decline and confronts the fact that chronological age does not necessarily coincide with physical senescence. There is a growing sense that the ethnographic subject's perspective must rise to the spirit of Gell's challenge of scrutiny. Natural fertility theory, as it has been applied to high-fertility regimes, suggests that women do not change their fertility behaviors according to the number of children born, although they may stop sexual life at menopause if grand-motherhood status demands. Evidence supporting the assertions about managing the pace and character of female senescence through reproduction comes from many sources. It comes from women's behaviors and stated desires about future pregnancies. A line of support for the argument that fertility experience is critical to women's physical condition is found in comparing variations in pregnancy histories among women who report that they are near the tipping point of reproductivity and who are of similar ages but different physical stages.",

While there are no general indicators of ill health associated with masturbation, it can be powerfully negative or positive for many individuals. As an example, it is widely used in sex therapy as a means of improving the sexual health of the individual and/or relationship. Promoting masturbation as a means of a public health strategy for sexual health is highly controversial; however, there are arguments and evidence that suggest that this may be an important part of any public health approach to improving sexual health. There is a need for more research on the impact of masturbation on self-esteem, body image, sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction and methods for using masturbation to promote sexual health. There is also a need for more of a theoretical approach to the formation of hypotheses to be tested.",

However, there is great variability in the heights and weights that are within the range of normal. Abnormally slow growth may indicate a pathological process or disruption of the environment. Height is a genetically determined parameter, but, at least in the human, it is affected by the interactions of hundreds of genes. In otherwise well children, perhaps 80% of the variance is inherited. Pubertal maturation follows a “fixed” sequence in boys and girls, but its timing and tempo are both determined by the interactions of multiple genes. Environmental effects may play a role in the early initiation of puberty in the obese and the delayed initiation in those with caloric deprivation. Subjects with pathologic growth trajectories deserve medical evaluation because those processes may be abrogated with proper treatment.",

Feminism can counter oppression that women are subject to notably through weight bias and SDO, but no studies have focused directly on these variables among men, as feminist identity is linked to less endorsement of certain beliefs in SDO and weight bias. The purpose of the present study is to explore the associations between feminist identification and beliefs, SDO, and weight bias among men from Quebec. Participants were divided into four feminist identification groups. Results indicate that feminist identification in men is linked to lower levels of SDO and less dislike toward people considered overweight. Also, feminism seems to predict prejudice toward others, but not toward oneself whereas SDO-D seems to be a good predictor of the belief that weight is controllable.",

      "title": "The health and human rights of people with intersex variations",
      "abstract": "People with innate variations of sex characteristics, or intersex traits, have any of a wide range of physical characteristics that differ from norms for female and male bodies. These traits are perceived in ways that create experiences and risks of stigmatisation, discrimination, violence and harmful medical practices intended to promote social and familial integration. Like all stigmatised populations, a range of different language is used to describe intersex bodies, but many individuals with these traits lack a vocabulary to understand themselves. Dominant frameworks treat people with intersex traits as disordered and in need of fixing and/or as an 'other' category of sex, in need of recognition. Neither approach respects the diversity of the population and differing personal values and preferences. Specific traits are sometimes associated with specific health issues, frequently including innate or iatrogenic infertility, while one trait can be fatal if not medicated. Attempts to promote the right to bodily integrity seek to distinguish medical interventions to promote physical health and wellbeing from harmful but still prevalent interventions grounded in gender stereotypes or ideas about social and familial integration. A small but growing number of jurisdictions are taking action to promote bodily integrity and the right to health.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide the population of older adults is growing in complexity and diversity, including by sexual orientation and gender identity. Based on an innovative life course equity framework, this study reveals new cutting-edge findings on the interplay between marginalization, identity, health behaviors, quality of life and health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older adults, and assesses key differences by sex and age group. Based on three most recent waves of longitudinal data (N = 2,450) from Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study (NHAS), this study applied fixed effect models examining within-subject changes in experiences of discrimination, identity stigma and affirmation, and health behaviors over time on quality of life and cognitive and functional impairment. Within-subject increases in day-to-day discrimination, identity stigma, and poor nutrition across time points predicted lower levels of physical, psychological, social, and environmental QOL. Within-subject increases in day-to-day discrimination and poor nutrition and decreases in physical activity predicted higher levels of cognitive and functional impairment, while an increase in microaggresions and decrease in identity affirmation predicted higher levels of cognitive impairment. Gender and generational differences were found. Change in day-to-day discrimination had a greater impact on men; poor nutrition had a greater impact on the oldest old. As the population ages, it is imperative to identify groups at highest risk and those aging well to ascertain modifiable mechanisms so that global research, practices, and policies can be tailored to improve the health and well-being of our growing worldwide demographically diverse older adult population.",

The monitoring of children’s growth and maturation is\nnot a simple task, and in part both ethical and methodological constraints have\nhindered our understanding of the growing child. Although growth and maturation are related concepts, it is important to acknowledge that although they are\nrelated, they are harmonized by differing time-scales and are probably controlled\nunder separate biological regulation (Armstrong and Welsman 1997). The term\n‘development’ has also been used in relation to growth and maturation but this\nterm really refers to broader concepts that include behavioural and psychological\nas well as biological domains. Children are often placed into chronological age\ngroups but it is well recognized that chronological age is a poor marker of\nbiological maturity. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the key mechanisms\nof growth in preparation for later chapters where its impact upon motor development and motor control are discussed.

      "abstract": "On the basis of family histories, a series of psychoneurotic patients in a university psychiatric clinic was compared to a group of their contemporaries not selected as to mental disease. Minor illnesses and family difficulties were disregarded throughout. The results indicated that 2 concepts (intrafamily conflict and mental disease in some member of the family group) are important concomitants of neurosis. The following conclusions were suggested by the data. Mental illness in parents, separation of parents or lack of adjustment between them, rejection by parent figures, parental overrestriction, mental illness in siblings or disturbed relationships between them, and disruption of the subject's marriage are indicated considerably more frequently in those students suffering from psychoneurosis than in the university population at large. Death, prolonged physical illness or foreign birth of parents, extra relatives living in the home, sibling favoritism, lack of siblings, and factors relating to size of sibship or relative ages of siblings are found no more often in the neurotics than in the others. The margin of difference between the two sets of items is great enough to suggest that the same conclusions may be true for psychoneurotic people in general.",

      "title": "Skeletal growth and the changing genetic landscape during childhood and adulthood",
      "abstract": "Growth, development, and decline of the human skeleton are of central importance to physical anthropology. All processes of skeletal growth (longitudinal growth as well as gains and losses of bone mass) are subjected to environmental and genetic influences. These influences, and their relative contributions to the phenotype, can be asserted at any stage of life. We present here the gross phenotypic and genetic landscapes of four skeletal traits, and show how they vary across the life span. Phenotypic sex differences are found in bone diameter and cortical index (a ratio of cortical thickness over bone diameter) at a very early age and continue throughout most of life. Sexual dimorphism in summed cortical thickness and bone length, however, is not evident until shortly after the pubertal growth spurt. Genetic contributions (heritability) to these skeletal phenotypes are generally moderate to high. Bone length and bone diameter (which both scale with body size) tend to have the highest heritability, with heritability of bone length fairly stable across ages (with a notable dip in early childhood) and that of bone diameter peaking in early childhood. The bone traits summed cortical thickness and cortical index that may better reflect bone mass, a more plastic phenomenon, have slightly lower genetic influences, on average. Results from our phenotypic and genetic landscapes serve three key purposes: 1) demonstration of the integrated nature of the genetic and environmental underpinnings of skeletal form, 2) identification of periods of bone's relative sensitivity to genetic and environmental influences, 3) and stimulation of hypotheses predicting the effects of exposure to environmental variables on the skeleton, given variation in the underlying genetic architecture.",

      "title": "Child sexual abuse : Disclosure, social support and subjective health in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a known risk factor for ill-health. It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae – a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member’s experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

      "abstract": "To date, the body image literature has largely ignored older men, as the bulk of the research has focused on young and middle-aged women. Where studies have been conducted with older men, they have tended to only consider the perspectives of men in their 50s and 60s or to include older men as part of mixed gender or diverse age samples. Thus, little is known about how older men perceive, experience, and feel about their aging and changing bodies, even as the body is central to older men’s understanding and practice of masculinity as well as their position in age- and gender-based systems of inequality. Addressing this gap in the research, we conducted in-depth interviews with 22 community-dwelling men aged 67–90 years (average age of 77 years). Drawing upon age relations and masculinities theorizing, we asked the men about how they evaluated and felt about their appearances, health, physical abilities, and sexual functioning. Our thematic analysis revealed that the men were largely satisfied with their appearances and physical functioning, particularly their approximation to masculine ideals of youthfulness, healthiness, and independence. Whereas half of the men identified their weight as a source of body satisfaction, all of the men disparaged obesity and stereotypical older men’s enlarged stomachs in particular. That said, the men discounted appearance as an unimportant and feminized concern. In contrast, they emphasized the salience of health and body functionality, expressing concern about how changes to their physical abilities and sexual functioning had already affected, and might in the future increasingly delimit, their daily lives, and hence they preferred social and physical pursuits. We consider our findings in light of age and masculinity ideals, which collectively privilege youthful bodies and subordinate older men.",

Families in which an overweight mother was in treatment were found to be more disengaged and rigid, have less regard between the spouses, and have a mother who was less assertive and more passive-aggressive with anger, and who reacted more strongly to emotions. However, the absence of this pattern in some families with overweight mothers of greater weight stability and lower levels of emotional eating indicated the importance of identifying obese subgroups. In addition, emotional eating was able to differentiate between normal-weight subgroups, thus challenging the practice of defining groups solely on the basis of weight status. Data on cognitive and emotional components of restrained eating also challenge the central role given to cognitive control in some models of eating and suggest that emotional eating is more important. For example, high levels of cognitive control were found even in people with no history of weight lability or emotional eating, and cognitive control was not related to weight status whereas emotional eating was.",

Studies show that loneliness is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia and chronic diseases, and also with a higher rate of mortality. Risky health behaviors, a poor cardiovascular profile and compromised immune functioning have all been proposed as potential pathways through which loneliness may affect health.

      "title": "Psychological development",
      "abstract": "Psychological development refers to growth and progress on the full gamut of human dimensions across the lifespan. The study of psychological development has been concerned with questions such as: What develops?; In what sequence?; Are there identifiable stages and phases of development?; What processes underlie developmental change?; Are there general principles of development and change that apply across all ages?; What factors enhance or retard development?; What explains inter-individual differences?; and To what extent is development socially and culturally determined? An engagement with the literature reveals a range of very different theoretical and empirical approaches to the above questions. Furthermore, the questions that are posed are typically framed within a particular theoretical position and/or contain basic theoretical assumptions about development. In the developmental literature there are two broad fields of enquiry: one concerned with the devel-opment of cognitive and intellectual capabilities across the lifespan; the other concerned with social and emotional development or one's sense of self or identity. The early research in both these fields of enquiry focused on child development – arguably because of the need to understand children's learning given the growth of education in the latter part of the nineteenth century and also because of a commonly held belief that adult maturity was the end-point of development. Nowadays a great deal of research has been undertaken on adult development. Once again this may beconnected with the need for adults to engage in lifelong learning in the context of continuing technological, social and organisational change and the subsequent increasing educational provision for adults in formal and informal settings throughout life. A common thread in the developmental literature, then, has been the application of developmental theories across the entire lifespan. In many ways the application of developmental theories to adults has raised new questions and issues that have helped shape thinking in relation to the development of children. For example, in adult developmental research there has been a general move away from identifying common sequences of predictable stages and phases, which characterised earlier attempts to document development. Instead the emphasis is now placed on the impact of social and historical factors in accounting for multidirectional change and variability in life trajectories (see for example, Smith and Baltes, 1999; Elder, 1998). Research into child development has followed suit, paying greater attention to the social and historical factors that influence the direction and timing of development. Of course this trend is also a response to the increasing need to recognise cultural diversity among those attending educational institutions. I am not suggesting that the pragmatic needs of educators alone drive the theory construction of developmental psychologists in a direct and explicit way, however,it is clear that broad social concerns, including those of educators, provide a context in which it is possible for developmental theorists to raise new questions and issues in their research. It is also worth noting that the education sector is a major user of the research on developmental psychology and this is understandable given that both education and developmental psychology have a common focus on learning.",

      "abstract": "Levels of loneliness are relatively stable across most of adult life, but correlates of loneliness show age differences. We review evidence of age differences in associations between loneliness and individual differences in health behaviors, stress exposure, physiological stress responses, appraisal and coping, and restorative processes. The effects of each of these pathways endow loneliness with the capacity to accelerate the rate of physiological decline with age. Additional research across the lifespan is required to understand the nature of accrued loneliness effects on health behavior and physiology in the short and long term.",

So possibly I may be able to present ideas in a new way. Mental abnormality may be divided into two sorts: lack of development and weakness. Let us consider the origin of each sort. The development of an individual is a complex of processes which work individually to the production of specific organs, and collectively to the development of the individual as a whole. Modern studies in heredity indicate that, typically, each part develops to a certain extent independently of every other, at least in the early stages. Later the secretions of thyroid and thymus, testis and ovary, and doubtless other organs, exert a general or a specific influence on development. Finally, insufficient nutrition of the embryo or the presence of certain",

      "abstract": "This paper synthesises the evidence on the sexual and reproductive health situation of young people in India, and explores what we know about underlying factors that place them at risk of or protect them from unsafe and unwanted sexual and reproductive health experiences. The picture that emerges suggests that substantial proportions of young people experience risky or unwanted sexual activity, do not receive prompt or appropriate care, and experience adverse reproductive health outcomes. Contextual factors such as poverty, gender imbalances and lack of education or livelihood opportunities clearly increase the vulnerability of youth. Other factors at the family, community and facility level may also exacerbate risk. While young people’s knowledge and awareness about sexual and reproductive health is increasing, much of this knowledge remains superficial and ridden with myths, misperceptions and a sense of invulnerability. Gender power imbalances make risky behaviours acceptable, encourage secrecy and fear of disclosure, and inhibit negotiation among partners. Lack of communication with parents and other trusted adults, similarly, keeps young people ill informed and unlikely to receive parental support or counsel in relation to sexual matters. Sexuality education remains inadequate and irrelevant to young people’s needs, and services remain inaccessible, unacceptable, unaffordable and of indifferent quality. Several encouraging signs are, however, evident. The sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents and young people are on the national agenda. There is growing recognition that young people themselves must be given a role in articulating, designing, implementing and evaluating such programmes. Finally, experiences of a few programmes already exist that appear to successfully respond to young people’s sexual and reproductive health needs in innovative and acceptable ways. The paper concludes by recommending, on the basis of available evidence, a core set of promising actions that protect.",

      "title": "Greater male variability in daily energy expenditure develops through puberty",
      "abstract": "There is considerably greater variation in metabolic rates between men than between women, in terms of basal, activity and total (daily) energy expenditure (EE). One possible explanation is that EE is associated with male sexual characteristics (which are known to vary more than other traits) such as musculature and athletic capacity. Such traits might be predicted to be most prominent during periods of adolescence and young adulthood, when sexual behaviour develops and peaks. We tested this hypothesis on a large dataset by comparing the amount of male variation and female variation in total EE, activity EE and basal EE, at different life stages, along with several morphological traits: height, fat free mass and fat mass. Total EE, and to some degree also activity EE, exhibit considerable greater male variation (GMV) in young adults, and then a decreasing GMV in progressively older individuals. Arguably, basal EE, and also morphometrics, do not exhibit this pattern. These findings suggest that single male sexual characteristics may not exhibit peak GMV in young adulthood, however total and perhaps also activity EE, associated with many morphological and physiological traits combined, do exhibit GMV most prominently during the reproductive life stages.",

It replicates previous findings for the effects of chronological age and poor health on older age identity. The study also demonstrates that having children is associated with a middle-aged (rather than young) identification, while not being married (largely due to widowhood or divorce) is associated with labeling oneself as old (rather than middle-aged). In the comparisons both of persons who identify themselves as young rather than middle-aged, and middle-aged rather than old, the older category of people have less happiness and lower life satisfaction, suggesting that these transitions are experienced negatively.",

      "title": "Young Women's Perception of Body Shape/weight and Health: A Measurement Problem",
      "abstract": "IntroductionCulturally, body shape has been associated with health, social status and wealth, and vice versa, promoting a socially idealised body shape/weight for women to aspire to (1). Ideal body shape/weight has varied over the centuries depending on the social norms of the time and the quality of available evidence and information (2, 3). Improvements in our understanding of 'health' has led to a social dealignment where public attitudes shift from previous beliefs and images of healthy body to a new set of images purporting a healthy body (2, 3). Although, it is common to use a combination of body mass index (BMI) and weight for height as a measure of a healthy body, social norms are driven by social ideals, perceptions and expectations. One of the main feedback effects of linking body image to health is the superimposition of a thin body shape over a variety of healthy body shapes. In other words, there exists an ever widening gap between healthy body shapes and society's idealised body shape (4-6). It is this gap between information and social expectations /perceptions that may, at least in part, be responsible for some modern illnesses such as eating disorders (79). The negative and adverse effects of the idealisation of body shape has not had much impact on shifting social norms towards a 'fit' body rather than a thin body. Instead, the negativity is directed at people who do not conform to an ideal body shape.On the other hand, the media's take on this social issue and the use of media by manufacturers' to promote their products has established in the public mindset a link between an ideal body shape (thinness) and healthiness. A trawl of the literature points to a bias towards women, due to a female-biased media, e.g., the visual portraying of healthiness with the emphasis on appearance (6). It is reasonable to assume that, on average, compared with men, women are more adversely affected by the negative feedback from the social idealisation of body shape, resulting in anxiety, eating disorders, and depression (5, 7, 10).In this paper we look at the value of subjective psycho-social emotional measurements such as 'happy with body weight' and 'at ease with opposite sex' in informing and providing insight into understanding the link between socially idealised body weight/shape and wellbeing.BackgroundHuman behaviour is a dynamic process. Over and above temporal dependencies and change over time, one of the main features of a process is the feedback effect. For example, the theory of cognitive dissonance may explain some of the variations in attitudes and perceptions over time. Cognitive dissonance explains that individuals align their attitude to their current social state upgrading the satisfaction with both positive and negative attributes of their current state and downgrading those of possible alternatives (11-13). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that years of exposure to the media's visual emphasis on body shape and healthiness will have had a major influence on shaping individuals' attitudes and perceptions of body shape/weight.An obvious interventional approach to break the link between body shape and health is to disestablish or at least attenuate the relationship between perceptions of body image and healthiness. For example, Slater et al. (14), describe an experiment that placed warning labels on fashion and women's magazines to inform readers that the images had been digitally enhanced, in order to ameliorate the negative psycho-social effects of idealised media images. Halliwell and Diedrichs (4) reported that a cognitive dissonance intervention in young girls led to fewer girls in their sample reporting body dissatisfaction. Other researchers report similar effects using a simple intervention such as using images of healthy weight models, i.e., the respondent's body ideals were significantly larger than when the same women viewed images of very thin models (5). …",

It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one’s male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

      "abstract": "Posture is defined as “body’s attitude or the positioning of the limbs when standing or sitting.” There are numerous postures to choose from, such as lordotic posture, swayback posture, flat back, and anterior pelvic tilt. In some other aspects of their lives, everyone considers pain to be an unpleasant feeling or sensation. Low back pain, in particular, can be relentless and intimidating to many people, who often recover without the need for a health care professional or any treatment simply by changing their posture or performing the movement. Other than the postural fault, a variety of factors contribute to low back pain, including age, sedentary lifestyle, anxiety, and sleep. However, when we look at back pain, posture has become deep-rooted in people’s thoughts. Health care professionals have instructed people to correct their posture to fight back pain. As we become older, our posture becomes worse, but this issue does not seem to cause pain. If you cannot move your body, that does not mean that you are having a problem involving posture, which is actually because of a problem in movement. A study proved that there is no difference in the lordotic angle of the populace having an issue with LBP. There is a decrease in the range and speed of the movement performed. What matters is your movement rather than the appearance of standing or sitting. The major goal of this study was to establish a relationship between static posture and discomfort. During the study, researchers examined whether there was a link between low back pain and posture among low back pain patients. According to recent studies, there is no relationship between posture and LBP. Many studies have been published to support this evidence. We refer to the importance of posture and alignment when performing a heavy deadlift, landing a jump, or engaging in any strenuous activity. As a result, the desire to write a paper on this topic stems from a desire to change the mindset of many people who are concerned about their postural flaws or appearances by providing information about varying their static posture to conform to some ideal and keeping moving to improve their function.",

Although much research has examined dependency or the reliance on other individuals or institutions, this analysis instead focuses on difficulty in performing activities of daily living. The authors employ logit analysis and the Longitudinal Study of Aging data set to examine the sociodemographic factors-age, sex, race, education, poverty status, and marital status-that affect the prevalence of disability and the transitions that arise between the able and disabled states. Findings show that age is linked with disability: Older respondents are more likely to be or to become disabled and less likely to recover from their disabilities. Education is also strongly linked with disability: More highly educated elderly consistently enjoy less disability; if disabled, they generally have greater chances to regain their abilities. Race and sex are key variables: Disability varies by race and sex groups; further, within race/sex subpopulations, disability is differentially affected by other covariates, especially marital status and poverty. Therefore, it is crucial to examine disability not only for the total elderly population but to appreciate different disability characteristics among race- and sex-specific subpopulations. These social, demographic, and economic factors identify characteristics that place the elderly at risk of disability, and they also identify those characteristics that enhance an individual's chances of successful aging.",

Thickening this sort of clinical research and practice on eating distress entails moving beyond pathologized symptoms of eating disorders and presumptions around whose eating is disordered, toward a deep engagement with embodied experiences. Rather than slotting individuals into categories of normal or abnormal, we might consider what dis/ordered relations with food mean in relation to myriad bodily expressions.",

      "title": "Hormetic sexuality and eroticism promote healthy ageing",
      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this chapter I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that, health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation, it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

      "title": "Understanding Sex Differences in Childhood Undernutrition: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Complementing a recent systematic review and meta-analysis which showed that boys are more likely to be wasted, stunted, and underweight than girls, we conducted a narrative review to explore which early life mechanisms might underlie these sex differences. We addressed different themes, including maternal and newborn characteristics, immunology and endocrinology, evolutionary biology, care practices, and anthropometric indices to explore potential sources of sex differences in child undernutrition. Our review found that the evidence on why sex differences occur is limited but that a complex interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors likely underlies these differences throughout the life cycle. Despite their bigger size at birth and during infancy, in conditions of food deprivation, boys experience more undernutrition from as early as the foetal period. Differences appear to be more pronounced in more severe presentations of undernutrition and in more socioeconomically deprived contexts. Boys are more vulnerable to infectious disease, and differing immune and endocrine systems appear to explain some of this disadvantage. Limited evidence also suggests that different sociological factors and care practices might exert influence and have the potential to exacerbate or reverse observed differences. Further research is needed to better understand sex differences in undernutrition and the implications of these for child outcomes and prevention and treatment programming.",

Larger bodies are favoured by decreased juvenile mortality rate and decreased population growth rate (the sum of these is termed discounted juvenile mortality rate). 2. The effects of the other variables depend on whether environmental heterogeneity is spatial or temporal. Under spatial heterogeneity larger adult bodies are favoured by increased juvenile growth rate but varying adult mortality rate has no effect",

The sex-positive framework is contrasted with the predominant \"risk\" perspective that presumes that abstinence from sexual activity is the ideal behavioral outcome for teenagers. Evidence from longitudinal and behavioral genetic studies indicates that engaging in sexual intercourse in adolescence does not typically cause worse psychological functioning. The relationship context of sexual experience may be a critical moderator of its psychological impact. Moreover, cross-cultural data on adolescents' contraception usage, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections suggest that, despite the unacceptably high rate of negative health consequences among U.S. teenagers, adolescents can have the developmental capacity to regulate the health risks inherent in sexual activity. Understanding adolescent sexuality can be fostered by considering sexual well-being, a multidimensional construct that incorporates an adolescent's sexual self-efficacy, sexual self-esteem, feelings of sexual pleasure and satisfaction, and freedom from pain and negative affect regarding sexuality. New research is necessary to understand the development of adolescent sexual well-being, including its normative age trends, its reciprocal links with sexual behavior, and its impact on psychological and physical health.",

      "abstract": "The pig industry faces many animal welfare issues. Among these, biting behaviour has a high incidence. It is indicative of an existing problem in biters and is a source of physical damage and psychological stress for the victims. We categorize this behaviour into aggressive and non-aggressive biting, the latter often being directed towards the tail. This review focusses specifically on predisposing factors in early life, comprising the prenatal and postnatal periods up to weaning, for the expression of aggressive and non-aggressive biting later in life. The influence of personality and coping style has been examined in a few studies. It varies according to these studies and, thus, further evaluation is needed. Regarding the effect of environmental factors, the number of scientific papers is low (less than five papers for most factors). No clear influence of prenatal factors has been identified to date. Aggressive biting is reduced by undernutrition, cross-fostering and socialization before weaning. Non-aggressive biting is increased by undernutrition, social stress due to competition and cross-fostering. These latter three factors are highly dependent on litter size at birth. The use of familiar odours may contribute to reducing biting when pigs are moved from one environment to another by alleviating the level of stress associated with novelty. Even though the current environment in which pigs are expressing biting behaviours is of major importance, the pre-weaning environment should be optimized to reduce the likelihood of this problem.",

It does this by stimulating both the brain and the central nervous system, enabling you to avoid being sleepy while still keeping you attentive. A state of emotional or physical tension is defined as stress. It can be induced through the experience of something or thinking of something that causes you to feel uncomfortable, irritated, or nervous. Your body's response to adversity or demand is what we call stress. Among couples, male infertility is common. A failure in spermatogenesis is accountable for nearly half of all occurrences of infertility in marriage. Ageing, psychological stress, diet, physical exercise, coffee, hot water, hot scrotum, and cell phone usage are some of the few modifiable lifestyle variables that have a role in the development of infertility. Many hypotheses have been proposed to establish the link between stress in the workplace, life events (war, earthquake, etc.), and inability to conceive have been linked to inferior or degraded semen quality. In this review, we will discuss the effect on male fertility of elements including quality of life (such as exercise, diet, and other alterations to one's daily routine) and psychological stress. In addition, the effects on male fertility of elevated scrotal temperature, improper dietary habits, and physical inactivity will be discussed. The loss in male fertility, mainly due to ageing, inappropriate lifestyles, and environmental factors, is a significant public health concern in this century. Couples can enhance their quality of life and increase their chances of naturally conceiving a child by altering their way of life and supplementing it with nutraceutical antioxidants and an organised educational, environmental, dietary, and physical exercise program.",

Remaja dalam pergaulanya sangat mudah terpengaruh oleh ajakan lawan jenis dalam melakukan kegiatan penyimpangan seksual yang didasarkan atas dasar saling menyukai dan rasa ingin tahu yang tinggi. Remaja tidak pernah memikirkan akan dampak dari kegiatan hubungan seksual yang mereka lakukan mulai dari dampak negative pandangan masyarakat yang akan diterima remaja maupun dampak kesehatan yang akan terjadi dengan hubunangan seksual diluar pernikahan. Remaja tersebut biasanya masih menyandang status sebagai siswa atau siswi sehingga perlu mendapatkan perhatian khusus dalam hal peningkatan kemampuan kognitif atau pengetahuan tentang dampak-dampak dari kegiatan seks bebas yang kerap kali terjadi dilingkungan siswa ataupun siswi. Pemberian informasi yang kurang tepat akan menyebabkan persepsi atau prilaku dari siswa tersebut dapat mengalami penyimpangan salah satunya kegiatan seks bebas. Kondisi ini jika dibiarkan berlanjut akan meningkatkan prilaku seks bebas dilingkungan remaja dalam hal ini siswa. Adapaun beberapa dampak dari prilaku penyimangan seperti seks bebas akan berdampak pada terjadinya kehamilan yang tidak diinginkan, melakukan aborsi sebagai akibat dari seks bebas, mengalami masalah kesehatan seperti berisiko terinfeksi HIV AIDS. Bentuk pencegahan yang dapat dilakukan untuk meminimalisir berbagai dampak tersebut maka perlu diberikan edukasi kesehatan sehingga siswa, siswi dapat memahami akibat dan dampak dari kegiatan pergaulan bebas terutama seks bebas sehingga diharapkan prilaku seks bebas dapat dihindari, diminimalisir oleh siswa, siswi sebagai penerus kehidupan Berbangsa dan Bernegara.

This is based on the observation that aging is a major risk factor for development of chronic diseases and degenerative conditions. The rate of aging can be understood as the losses of function coupled with the advent of chronic diseases with the passage of time. It is often represented as physiological or biological age versus chronological age or years. From this simple picture three questions emerge: What are the metrics used to measure physiological aging? Do these metrics – or biomarkers of aging – explain the “risk factor” aspect of aging that underlies the geroscience hypothesis? Do these biomarkers of aging account for the variation in health for each age group in a population?",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Gender dysphoria (GD) is defined as a marked incongruence between their experienced or expressed gender and the one they were assigned at birth. Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a highly prevalent, age-related disorder which has a significant impact on the quality of life and social well- being of both the patient and the partner. It is a progressive disease associated with many vascular and cardiac risk factors. The subject of sexual dysfunction is more widely discussed in the media as a result of newer therapies that have become available in the past decade. Therefore, men and women of all ages are seeking assistance to improve their sexual relationships. Male sexual dysfunction refers to a problem with one or more of the four components of male sexual function, i.e. libido, erection, ejaculation or orgasm, that interferes with the ability or interest to engage in sexual intercourse. Psychological and physical factors as well as drugs may affect male sexual dysfunction. Female sexual dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes, related to desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain disorders. This article focuses mainly on erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. However, it is important to remember that the sexual partner plays an integral role in the successful and effective management of the ED patient.",

      "title": "The Biology of Human Longevity, Aging and Age-Associated Diseases",
      "abstract": "In order to better understand the finitude of life it must be divided into its four components: aging, longevity determination, age-associated disease and death. Age changes result from the increasing rate of biomolecular disorder that, after reproductive maturation, exceeds repair and turnover capacity. These are stochastic or chance events governed by entropy or the tendency for concentrated energy to disperse when unhindered. The hindrance is the relative strength of chemical bonds. The maintenance of chemical bonds until reproductive maturation is absolutely necessary for species survival. Genes do not cause aging but genes do indirectly govern longevity by determining the energy status of biomolecules before age changes occur, or to reproductive maturation. Longevity is indirectly governed by genes because the strategy of producing excess physiological capacity to better ensure survival to reproductive maturation allows life to continue beyond that crucial point. Through natural selection biomolecules must retain structure and function until reproductive success or the species will vanish. Selection for the maintenance of molecular fidelity beyond reproductive success is unnecessary for species survival. Thus, the aging process begins. The failure to distinguish age changes from disease or pathology is a fundamental problem that has not only blurred efforts to understand the biology of aging and the determination of longevity but it has profound political and economic consequences. Aging is not a disease because, unlike any disease, age changes (1) occur in every animal that reaches a fixed size in adulthood. (2) cross virtually every species barrier. (3) occur in all animals that reach a fixed size in adulthood and only after sexual maturation. (4) occur in animals removed from the wild and protected by humans even when that species has not been known to experience aging for thousands or millions of years. (5) increase vulnerability to death in 100 percent of the animals in which they occur. (6) occur in both animate and inanimate objects. Of the four aspects of the finitude of life, the only aspect that humans have manipulated is disease or pathology and that has a significant limit. If all causes of death currently written on death certificates were to be resolved, average human life expectancy at birth could not exceed about 93 years. The only way that this number can be exceeded is if we could intervene in the fundamental aging process itself or in the determinants of longevity. These possibilities are presently remote if for no other reason than the research investment in this effort is orders of magnitude less than what is available for research on age-associated diseases. The widespread belief that the resolution of age-associated diseases will increase our understanding of the fundamental aging process is spurious. Aging is a process that is only experienced by humans and the animals that we choose to protect like zoo and domestic animals. We, and those animals, now survive well beyond young adulthood. That did not occur for the majority of time that we have been a species and it is, in fact, an aberration of civilization attributable to our discovery of how to eliminate many causes of death. Immortality does not exist in biology because cells and their constituent molecules turn over or are replaced. The only long-lasting biological property on an evolutionary time scale is the information coded in the DNA of the genome and mitochondria, but even that information is subject to mutation or change. There is an almost universal belief by geriatricians and others that the greatest risk factor for all of the leading causes of death is aging. Why then are we not devoting significantly greater resources to understand more about the greatest risk factor for every age-associated pathology by attempting to answer this fundamental question: What changes occur in biomolecules that lead to the manifestations of aging at higher orders of complexity and then increase vulnerability to all age-associated pathology?",

Perubahan bentuk tubuh, penurunan fungsi organ, gejala-gejala menopause, penyakit degeneratif dan lainnya menimbulkan stress tersendiri dan memerlukan adaptasi dan penanganan yang baik. Salah satu masalah utama yang dihadapi oleh pasangan lansia adalah disfungsi seksual akibat terjadinya perubahan dan penurunan fungsi organ seksual. Aktifitas seksual merupakan merupakan hal yang fundamental dalam membentuk kedekatan antara suami dan istri dan sangat erat kaitannya dengan kualitas dan stabilitas perkawinan. Berbagai perubahan yang dialami, disadari dan saling dimengerti diantara pasangan lansia dalam melewati fase-fase pernikahan akan menimbulkan suatu kepuasan yang holistik tidak hanya kepuasaan seksual. Namun hal ini juga dipengaruhi oleh latar belakang pendidikan dan kebudayaan seseorang. Kelekatan, intimasi, aktifitas seksual, dan komunikasi yang baik menciptakan kualitas pernikahan yang baik Disfungsi seksual pada lansia tidak mempengaruhi keharmonisan rumah tangga karena proses adaptasi yang baik, kemampuan pemecahan masalah, intimasi dan kelekatan serta komunikasi yang baik. Disamping itu pada lansia juga telah terjadi pergeseran dari cinta eros menjadi agape, sehingga cinta eros yang dipengaruhi oleh struktur biologispun tertutupi oleh cinta filia dan agape yang akhirnya meningkatkan ketiga cinta tersebut. Pasangan lansia yang memiliki kendala dalam hal seksualitas dapat meminta bantuan kepada tenaga kesehatan profesional. Penanganan yang bisa diberikan berupa konseling dan edukasi, farmakoterapi, terapi non famakologi seperti terapi perilaku kognitif, terapi pasangan dan terapi seksual yang melibatkan pasangannya.",

Engaging with religious traditions on the common ground of basic values (such as human dignity, care, the sacredness of human life, non-violence, compassion, and selflessness) promotes negotiation of the manner in which care is provided, even where conflicts exist.",

In any food containing the necessary nutrients the brain to produce a chemical substance as the base material neurotrasnmiter, which makes it possible to enhance the individual's mental tasks, the content of these nutrients will also affect the formation of emotional processes in the brain, especially the emotional aggression. Aggressiveness is the behavior of physical violence or verbal against other individuals or objects, aggression as behavior that is deliberately intended to injure another person (physically or verbally) or destroy property. Aggressive behavior that often appears in the media and sticking out in various corners of the country, not only due to mere social phenomenon, but is caused by three interrelated factors that influence organobiologis related to biological and genetic factors a person, who touched second psikoedukatif aspects of parenting and education since the age of the children in the family, child growth and development of psychiatric conditions; third is sociocultural and spiritual related to social conditions in society.

      "abstract": "Peoples sexuality and contraceptive needs are examined at 2 important periods of life -- adolescence and middle age. Human sexuality as much psychological as it is physical involves the mind and the body. Contraceptive and sexuality must be linked. When choosing methods of contraception couples must consider the facts and select what appeals to them in view of their needs fertility moral or religious habits and their cultural and individual attitudes towards sexual relationships and male and female roles. Another important principle is that the contraceptive needs of a person will vary throughout his/her life. With physical and psychological maturity occurring progressively earlier and the age of marriage becoming later it is inevitable that an increasing number of adolescents experiment with sex or have sexual relations outside marriage. The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) implies a premeditated intention to be sexually involved which many young women do not have as well as the ability and motivation to take pills regularly. The insertion of an IUD reduces the problem of poor motivation but the complication rates tend to be increased in young nulliparae which requires followup visits. 1 problem with the diaphragm is that nulliparous teenagers frequently find the procedure of fitting a diaphragm rather offputting. It also requires preparation for each act of intercourse. Condoms appear particularly suitable for unmarried teenagers because their use does not require any preparation or long-term planning and they are available from many retail outlets. Postcoital contraception is of use after a single episode of unprotected midcycle intercourse. The sexual potential of the human female is at its greatest between the ages of 35-45. By the time women reach the 40-45 year age group the fertility rate drops by more than 1/2. Barrier methods which are related specifically to each act of intercourse are particularly suitable for the older couple. The IUD requires no daily motivation and gives an overall failure rate of 3-5 pregnancies/100 women years. This is lower among older women. Many older women who have completed their families and want to stop taking the OC seek sterilization as the best method of fertility control.",

Is the location of mandibular fractures haphazard and arbitrary, or are there predisposing factors which tend to influence this location? No doubt the shape of the bone itself plays an important role in determining the location of some of the fractures. The narrow neck of the mandible, with its reduced cross-sectional area, is probably less strong than the body or the symphysis. Also in this regard the magnitude of the energy of the impact will be significant. If the amount of energy imparted to the mandible is above the elastic limit of the bone, a fracture will occur, with most of the energy being dissipated in producing the one fracture. However, if the magnitude of the energy greatly exceeds the elastic limit, more fractures are likely to be produced. Does the state of dentition or the site of trauma have any influence on the location of these fractures? Up to this time, no clinical or experimental evidence has been presented to substantiate or refute these questions. It is the purpose of this report to present data regarding the relationship of the location of mandibular fractures and number of fractures with the site of impact, the state of dentition, and the age of the individual.",

Such fat stigma is pervasive, painful to experience, and may even facilitate weight gain, thereby perpetuating the obesity-stigma cycle. Leveraging research on functionally distinct forms of fat (deposited on different parts of the body), we propose that body shape plays an important but largely underappreciated role in fat stigma, above and beyond fat amount. Across three samples varying in participant ethnicity (White and Black Americans) and nation (U.S., India), patterns of fat stigma reveal that, as hypothesized, participants differently stigmatized equally-overweight or -obese female targets as a function of target shape, sometimes even more strongly stigmatizing targets with less rather than more body mass. Such findings suggest value in updating our understanding of fat stigma to include body shape and in querying a predominating, but often implicit, theoretical assumption that people simply view all fat as bad (and more fat as worse).",

      "title": "LIFE STYLE AND HEALTH EDUCATION",
      "abstract": "Lifestyle is the interest, behavior, opinion, style of living or world outlook of an individual, group, or culture; a combination of tangible factors like demographics and intangible factors like personal values and preferences.1 Recently researchers have more interest in the relationship between life style and health. Millions of people, following unhealthy lifestyle (or risk-factors), are plagued with morbidity, disability and mortality due to non-communicable, communicable diseases &amp; nutritional disorders. Persons having unhealthy behaviors may be called as ‘at risk groups’.2 Although a healthy lifestyle has consistently been shown to decrease mortality, the population prevalence of healthy living remains low.3 The mental health of an individual can be assessed by his behavior and attitude. Common lifestyle variables influencing health include diet, exercise, sleep, smoking, alcohol consumption, substance abuse, stress management, sexual behavior, internet, recreation, etc.4 Besides, weight management, exposure to the sun, social contact, work life balance, leisure activities, screening for cancer etc. make a healthy life style. Healthy ways of living are developed through processes of socialization with parents, friends, relatives and community. However, not all life style factors are harmful. There are many life styles that promote health. For example, adequate nutrition, exercise, meditation, enough sleep etc.5 Modern or slow epidemics of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) e.g. hypertension (HTN), coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, cancer etc. have been increasing in incidence compared to the previous century. With the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of NCDs is on the rise. About 2 billion people are overweight in developed as well as low to middle income countries.6 Comorbidities of obesity include HTN, CHD, DM, stroke, cancers, gallbladder disease, dyslipidaemia, osteoarthritis, gout and sleep apnoea.7 Obesity is not only preventable but treatable with lifestyle modifications to forestall DM.8 Furthermore, several pathways linking obesity and CHD have been described; in particular coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.9 In a study by CDC conducted in late 1970s in US, approximately 48% of all premature deaths prior to age 75 years could be traced to one’s lifestyle or health behavior choices, hence focusing on a personal responsibility model whereas another study accounts for about 63% of all deaths.10 Human behavior is a major obstacle to disease control. Changes in human behavior may prevent most of the world's major health problems &amp; premature deaths at low cost. Public health is defined as ‘the health status of a defined group of people and the governmental actions and conditions at the local, state, and national levels to promote healthy behaviors, prevent spread of disease and injuries, protect against environmental hazards &amp; disasters and assure the curative and rehabilitative health services. Many public health recommendations and clinical guidelines emphasize that healthy lifestyles have substantial health benefits.11 Changes in the life-style of the population by health education encompass three approaches of primary prevention as recommended by the WHO for prevention of chronic diseases. In first approach or primordial prevention, children are discouraged from adopting harmful lifestyles through individual/ mass education in countries in which many adult health problems (e.g., obesity, hypertension) have not yet appeared. Lifestyles are formed during childhood and aim is to prevent the emergence of risk factors. Second approach or population (mass) strategy is directed at the whole population, irrespective of individual risk level. A small reduction in the average blood pressure/ serum cholesterol in the community, helps in reducing the CHD prevalence. Third approach or high-risk strategy, on the other hand, aims to detect individuals at high risk by the optimum use of clinical methods and provide preventive care to them. To have an impact on the population, all the above three approaches should be implemented as they are usually complementary but the results are perceived after several decades and not immediately. Besides health education the population must have access to preventive measures.5 Lifestyle medicine program serves as a systematized approach to manage NCDS by addressing multiple risk factors through self-management skills.12 Physical activity leading to cardiorespiratory fitness is needed in all age groups, both sexes, race &amp; ethnicities to prevent NCDs including CVDs.13 Better control of behavioral risk factors alone could prevent one-third of all acute and two-thirds of chronic disabilities.

Physiological factors affecting women include: differential sensitivity and tolerance to nicotine, greater withdrawal symptoms, and the importance of timing quit attempts in relation to the menstrual cycle. Behavioral and psychological factors include the following: fear of weight gain, need for social support, depression and negative affect smoking, self-efficacy (confidence in ability to quit), and stage of change (readiness to quit smoking).

      "abstract": "Muchas son las diferencias que en cuanto a las características fisiológicas muestran los hombres frente a las mujeres. Estas diferencias fisiológicas afectan a la respuesta al ejercicio, y en consecuencia al diferente rendimiento deportivo. Diferencias en la composición corporal, el metabolismo del calcio y del hierro, el tamaño de órganos y aparatos, así como las diferencias en la edad de maduración afectan al rendimiento y a los patrones de ejercicio físico en las mujeres jóvenes. Otros cambios, como el embarazo y la menstruación modifican también esta respuesta tanto, desde el punto de vista fisiológico, como psicológico. A estas diferencias debemos añadir los factores sociológicos, debido a que la incorporación de la mujer al mundo del deporte de elite es relativamente reciente, y no siempre cuenta con el apoyo de medios técnicos, económicos y de comunicación necesarios. Tanto las diferencias fisiológicas como las psicológicas que caracterizan a las mujeres persistirán, por lo tanto parece necesario un mejor conocimiento de las mismas para comprender y obtener mejores resultados desde el punto de vista del rendimiento deportivo.",

During pregnancy, women are at increased risk of mood disorders, which also adversely affect birth outcomes. Unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and lack of close, well-functioning interpersonal relationships can also have undesirable consequences for pregnant mothers and their babies. Health disparities, differences by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, are prominent as well in maternal child health. On the positive side, stress research has broadened to include the resilience. Resilience resources that women possess including social support and favorable cultural factors and spirituality may benefit them emotionally and improve the outcomes of their pregnancies. Both stress and resilience must be considered to fully understand women's experiences of pregnancy and birth outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Western man does not in general appear to operate homeostatic mechanisms to control his energy storage. Fragmentation makes it difficult to draw comprehensive conclusions from the literature research, a report of which is included, and the fact that much of the energy balance work is based on experimentation with other species raises questions of relevance. Individual human beings may vary with regard to biochemical type or may experience phase difference in a famine/feast rhythm. These theories and the involvement of brown adipose tissue are examined in some detail. An attempt to 'type' individuals by measurement of respiratory quotient failed. A pilot investigation into core temperature difference shows promise. The responses to three questionnaire forms are analysed. Two questionnaires reveal a high level of anxiety about body weight among young people. The third investigates calcium and vitamin D consumption and the possibility of linkage with famine/feast phase state. It is concluded that although recognition of 'type' or 'phase state' might well provide a short cut, ultimately individual experimentation with a variety of foods is likely to be necessary, if diet modification is to reduce weight without adverse complications.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition affecting many thousands of children. It is a condition that can have adverse health, social and educational outcomes. It also exacts significant societal costs, economically and socially. This paper hypothesises that the population of children receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD is aetiologically heterogeneous: that within this population, there is a group for whom the development of ADHD is largely genetically driven, and another who have a ‘phenocopy’ of ADHD as a result of very adverse early childhood experiences, with the prevalence of this phenocopy being heavily skewed towards populations living with poverty and violence. A third group will have a high genetic risk and have been exposed to violence. These groups will overlap, with epigenetic phenomena and other environmental factors, for example, preterm birth, poor intrauterine growth, foetal exposure to teratogens, playing an important role for all affected children in determining the severity of their functional difficulties.\n\n### Phenocopies\n\nPhenocopies occur when people exhibit a phenotype that appears identical to that found in other individuals who have a linked genotype, but do not possess this genotype themselves. Environmental factors may cause this, as occurs in Rutter's autism phenocopy described in Romanian orphans adopted by western families in the early 1990s.1 These children had experienced extreme, profound neglect; after adoption, they began to present to services with abnormal or delayed development. Many presented a clinical and behavioural picture indistinguishable from autism in preschool children. However, follow-up revealed a different natural history to that of childhood autism, with these children no longer fulfilling criteria for autism, with mild cognitive impairment, low empathy and conduct problems prevailing in adolescence.2 Animal models suggest a possible epigenetic mechanism for this, with environments of profound neglect associated with alterations in gene expression as a result of …",

In the current article I review research on relationships between eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa) and sexual attitudes and experience among women, including the sexual functioning of women who have been treated for an eating disorder. After drawing some limited conclusions from past research, I discuss several potentially important mediating variables that may explain observed relationships between disordered eating and sexuality. These potential mediating variables include certain personality characteristics, negative body image, early familial experiences, and history of sexual trauma.

Abstract. Language according to Noam Chomsky, is an innate ability that can be used to communicate science. Analyzing the term obesity as a scientific concept will allow its correct epistemological approach to contribute to multidisciplinary scientific research that seeks to reduce this pandemic. Obesity is an excessive accumulation of body fat, in excess of physiological needs and adaptability, which can lead to adverse health effects, such as disability. It is considered a state in which adipose tissue represents more than 20% of total body weight in men and 25% in women. A BMI of 30 kg / m2 or more is classified as obesity. From a genetic perspective, obesity is classified into three subdivisions according to the disorder and number of genes involved: monogenic, syndromic and polygenic. For the social sciences, it involves a sociocultural problem grafted onto a predisposition at the individual level. From an evolutionary perspective, the human body is not developed for constant exposure to a calorie-rich and sedentary environment. Understanding the current theoretical perspectives that conceptualize obesity, stipulated as a pathology in itself, as a risk factor for other non-communicable diseases and as an indirect etiology of disability, will allow scientific research to be developed with broader perspectives, through its design with mixed variables, categories and theories, which allow the formulation of hypotheses and explanations with a multidisciplinary approach, in accordance with the multifactorial etiology of obesity.",

      "abstract": "According to the latest results of Croatian Institute of Public Health, there are more and more children and young adults who are diagnosed with behavioral or mental disorders. Today, personality disorders in adolescence are in the focus, they are important health problem because those problems reflect on families and society in general. Last decades, some important scientific researches on personality disorders in adolescence are present. Adolescence is the period of maturing where the child prepares himself/herself for adulthood; it is the period of turbulence, emotional ambivalences and intensive changes in physical, psychic, emotional, cognitive and sexual development. Numerous risks, to which young people are exposed to, can interfere with normal transition through that period and stimulate occurrence of certain disorder in the mental health of adolescence. Personality disorder is the condition where behavior and experience stand out from habitually and normal behavior; it is not adapted; it interferes with normal functioning of a young adult and it is not justified with the situation where the young person find himself/herself. The cause of disorder is interpreted as the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risky environmental factors in the childhood take big part in its origin and development of personality disorders. There is a big vigilance in diagnosis of personality disorder in adolescence, because the fact that psychophysical development of a young adult is not finished yet, symptoms of a certain personality disorders must be present for at least one year. We distinguish several types of personality disorders that can be recognized by certain characteristics. Personality disorders are conditions; they are not mental illnesses, but if the symptoms are not recognized on time and the young person does not protect himself/herself from the risky situations and enviornment, peronality disorders can develop in that direction. The key point in the treatment of personality disorders is the early identification of the problem, setting the correct diagnosis and individual approach in choosing of methods of treatment. Psychotherapy is the most common type of treatment, in which cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis and group psychotherapy are most used. Which one will be used, depends on the assessment that best suits the person with personality disorder. In the program of the mental health protection of the youth, that are introduced on the national level, series of measuers and acitivites are pursued and directed towards the promotion and advancement of mental health, early recognition of difficulties and disorders in mental functioning, and work with high-risk children and youth. The approach is interdisciplinary, teachers and professional associates play the key role in those activities in educational institutions. Their education, consultation and permanent specialization are very important.",

      "abstract": "Mass accumulations of fossilized large terrestrial vertebrate skeletons (bone beds: BB) provide a test for K-T catastrophic extinction hypotheses. The two major factors contributing to BB formation are mode of death and sedimentation rate. Catastrophic mass mortality (CMM) is the sudden death of numerous individuals where species, age, health, gender, or social ranking offer no survivorship advantage. Noncatastrophic mass mortality (NCMM) occurs over time and is strongly influenced by species, age, or gender. In addition to cause of death, sedimentation rate is also important in BB formation. Models of BBs can be made. The CMM drops all individuals in their tracks, therefore, the BB should reflect the living population with respect to species, age, or gender. The NCMM results in monospecific BBs skewed in the direction of the less fit, usually the very young or very old, or towards a specific gender. The NCMM and AM BBs may become more similar the more spread out over time NCMM deaths occur because carcasses are widely scattered requiring hydraulic accumulation, and the greater time allows for more disarticulation and weathering. The CMM and NCMM BB appear to be dominated by social animals. Applying this and the characteristics of mortality patterns to the uppermost Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation indicates that only NCMM and AM BB occur. Furthermore, NCMM BB are rare in the upper third of the Hell Creek. Near the K-T boundary, only AM BB are known. The absence of CMM and NCMM BB appears to be real reflecting a decrease in population levels of some dinosaurs prior to the K-T event. The absence of CMM suggests that the K-T event did not lead to an instantaneous extinction of dinosaurs. Nor was there a protracted die-off due to an asteroid impact winter, because no NCMM BB are known at or near the K-T boundary.",

A critical reappraisal of the evidence suggests a more balanced view of the mother-child relationship should be taken. A classification of the condition, founded on facts not concepts, is urgently required. Non-organic failure to thrive should be viewed in a multidimensional context, in which potential influences upon the symptomatic infant are considered. Inadequacy of nutrition is caused by both a failure of adequate provision of food and by inadequate intake. A vicious circle of maladaptive behavioural interaction between caregiver and infant is often present, sustained by high emotional tensions. Clinical intervention should aim to clarify the contributions made by both caregiver and infant to that interaction and thus break the cycle. The basis on which intervention is made should be direct observation of the parent and child relationship in as many different environmental contexts as feasible, especially during feeding. The multidisciplinary team has an important role to play in management. An emphasis on parental culpability in the aetiology of non-organic failure to thrive, in the absence of direct evidence of neglect, is wrong.",

Ademas, existen evidencias de que el riesgo de deterioro cognitivo aumenta entre los sujetos con alteraciones visuales y auditivas. La presente investigacion evalua la posible asociacion entre la presencia de deficit sensorial (visual, auditivo y dual) y la capacidad cognitiva del adulto mayor. Los datos ponen de manifiesto la alta prevalencia de los problemas de vision y audicion en los sujetos valorados, asi como un notable incremento del porcentaje de mayores con perdida sensorial dual. Este estudio evidencia, a su vez, que la prevalencia de deterioro cognitivo aumenta entre los mayores con perdida sensorial dual respecto a aquellos con un unico o ningun deficit sensorial, hallandose asociacion significativa entre el estado sensorial y la capacidad cognitiva en los gerontes examinados.",

      "abstract": "The relation between eating and drinking for adult mammals is defined by three characteristics. First, eating and drinking tend to occur together: they are episodic but temporally contiguous behaviours, entrained to environmental cues and occurring mainly during the waking hours. Second, eating and drinking appear to be reciprocal: sipping interrupts eating. Eating can have dehydrational consequences that elicit drinking, and drinking can disinhibit eating by preparing the palate or by removing dehydration. Third, eating and drinking serve homeostasis: ingestion will preclude and/or repair deficits in fuels, fluids or electrolytes.",

      "abstract": "Body size is a biological variable of fundamental importance and plays a central role in analyses of life history, sexual dimorphism, allometry, and natural and sexual selection. Yet, there remains a sizeable gulf in our understanding that lies between what we hypothesize influences change in size, from the point of view of ultimate causation, and what we know about how shifts in body size are regulated from a proximate perspective. I seek here to tie these two perspectives together, and specifically to argue that an understanding of the hormonal regulation of body size is necessary for constructing hypotheses regarding how body size evolves. Recent work using model organisms points to the insulin/insulin-like growth factor pathway as playing a key role in the regulation of growth, size, reproduction, and senescence. I review the role of various components of this pathway in regulating growth and size and illustrate the evidence for different ways in which these might work to generate differences in size in various organisms. Of particular interest are the tradeoffs between size and other life history traits produced by experimental alterations in this pathway. Recent work emphasizing the ways in which body size can be altered based on extrinsic factors provides the opportunity to link advances in uncovering the proximate bases of growth and size and offers an opportunity to frame new hypotheses regarding how variation in size evolves.

To a lesser extent, there is also a secular trend towards earlier puberty. However, it seems that the two trends are not strongly connected. The increase in average height over the generations can, to a large extent, be explained by an earlier onset of the growth hormone-dependent phase of growth in early life. The age when this growth ‘spurt’ occurs in childhood strongly correlates with final height, but is not related to the age at peak height velocity during puberty. There is a large variation in the timing of the onset of puberty; it is largely influenced genetically, as implied by studies in twins. The single environmental factor that stands out as most significant – possibly explaining as much as 25% of the variation in the timing of puberty – is simply nutritional status in childhood; overnutrition and obesity seem to trigger pubertal onset. However, recent studies have identified that both shortness and thinness at birth are also associated with earlier pubertal maturation – a reverse of their impact during childhood years. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; More longitudinal studies are needed to understand the short- and long-term consequences of secular changes in both final height and pubertal development before we know how important the trends are.",

      "title": "Sexual orientation and health : general and minority stress factors explaining health differences between lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual individuals",
      "abstract": "Previous studies show that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals report more health problems than heterosexual individuals. However, several important gaps remain in the knowledge regarding the explanations for these health differences. In general, there is a lack of differentiation between subgroups in the LGB population, a lack of specific attention for older LGB individuals and LGB youth who grow up in relatively tolerant countries, and a lack of combined between-and-within-groups study designs that examine factors associated with health differences. These gaps are addressed in the current dissertation. Although some gender and sexual orientation differences were found in the associations between risk factors and health problems, the presented studies that addressed potential gender and sexual orientation differences in the association between minority stress factors and mental health, sexual health, substance use, and social wellbeing provide no reason to suspect that the usefulness of the minority stress model differs substantially for sexual minority women and men or for lesbian/gay and bisexual individuals. In addition, the minority stress model seems to be a useful model for explaining health problems of both LGB youth and ageing LGB individuals. Research combining between-and-within-groups study designs was shown to be a useful way of examining health differences between LGB and heterosexual individuals. Firstly, using a between-and-within-groups design enabled showing that feelings of loneliness as well as sexual health problems of LGB individuals can be explained by general risk factors as well as by LGB-specific factors. To be most effective, interventions aiming to decrease sexual health problems among LGB adults or loneliness among elderly LGB individuals should therefore target both types of factors. Secondly, the use of a between-and-within-groups study design clearly showed the hypothesized, additive health compromising effects of minority stress factors. These findings provide important and novel support for one of the main assumptions of the minority stress model, that minority stress is a form of additive stress that is experienced by minority groups in addition to the stressors that are also experienced by members of the social majority, and that it is this additional stress takes its toll on LGB individuals and affects their health over and above general health risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Surrogate mothers, illegitimately pregnant teenagers, married women seeking abortions, women convicted of manslaughter, and sister survivors of early childhood sibling loss may share a common conflict. These women may be in a state of incomplete mourning, unconsciously wishing to master a trauma by turning a passive experience into a life event they can control. Pregnancy can function as that life event. Replacement daughters and/or sister survivors can present as our patients with a search for or an avoidance of pregnancy as a crucial though unconscious issue. Literature written about this sequelae of early sibling death is reviewed according to psychosexual and object relationship stages. Common and uncommon consequences are discussed. Vignettes from the course of psychoanalytic therapy with women whose brothers had been accidently killed; whose sibling had died of metabolic disease; and those whose siblings had been relinquished to foster care are used to illustrate the immediate and long-term reactions. The range of these include varieties of separation anxiety as well as learning inhibitions in latency; exaggerated pseudo heterosexuality and other risk taking at puberty; problems in self-esteem regulation relative to either the idealized memory of the missing sibling or the omnipotence connected with survivor guilt. This paper focuses on the choice of a sexual partner and pregnancy issues as symptoms of reworking established conflicts around self-valuation and abandonment by sibling and grieving parents. As the family relationships around the lost sibling become less distorted in her analysis via transference resolution, so do the feelings about contemporary relationships. Becoming pregnant is then not an event burdened by die past.",

Addiction is an ironic disorder. The very community that provides the set of socially certified norms and aspirations for a good life, also often sets out norms for using alcohol and other dangerous drugs in ways that mark membership in that community. The addict has trouble putting their reasons, their best thinking, and their considered ideals in reliable control of their actions, and they have trouble abiding by the moral norms upon which their sense of their own integrity and self-worth turns.",

Exposures associated with adverse developmental outcomes include air and water pollution, chemicals in foods, occupational exposures, agricultural chemicals, metals, persistent and volatile organics. Developmental endpoints which are linked with these exposures include growth restriction, functional abnormalities, structural abnormalities, preterm delivery and death. Despite this general understanding we still have incomplete knowledge concerning most exposures and the biological interactions responsible for impaired development and preterm delivery.Whereas single genes and individual chemical exposures are responsible for some instances of adverse pregnancy outcome or developmental disease, gene-environment interactions are responsible for the majority. These gene-environment interactions may occur in the father, mother, placenta or fetus, suggesting that critical attention be given to maternal and paternal exposures and gene expression as they relate to the mode of action of the putative developmental toxicant both prior to and during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Being healthy is much desired by all people. Disease and ill-health are not only ‘‘harvest by chance’’ - many of the determinants of health are well known. We know from research that ill-health as well as the majority of chronic or longstanding diseases are related to unhealthy lifestyles, for example, smoking, wrong diet, physical inactivity, and exaggerated alcohol consumption. Today, we refer to these conditions as ‘‘welfare- or lifestyle diseases.’’ People learn behaviors and habits - rather than those being innate - and these behaviors and habits can be affected by one’s own strength and also be replaced by other more health supporting ones. However, it is not as simple as it sounds to change one’s lifestyle, because it is commonly grounded in structural conditions as well as in gender, class, ethnicity, and sexuality. To change lifestyle, it is necessary to acquire more knowledge and enhance one’s awareness of the relationships between lifestyle and health. Factors that promote health can, for example, be to have a satisfying job and to enjoy economic stability or close social relations. Participation in cultural life also has health promoting effects, independent of earlier cultural habits.

      "abstract": "Maintaining upright is an unique feature of human beings and the basis for active and healthy life. Two of the greatest concerns for the elderly, functional dependence and falling, have been reported to be closely related to impaired balance performance. Thus, it is clear that balance performance plays a prominent role in the well beings of older adults. However, aging is typically accompanied by deteriorations in balance ability. Problems in maintaining various static standing postures, performing dynamic balance tasks, or responding to balance threats are common among the elderly. In order to lessen the problems and to avoid their further complications, it is imperative to advance balance performance in older population. There is a large body of research aiming at determining the effect of physical activities on balance performance in the elderly. No universal conclusion regarding the extent of the effect, effectiveness of specific physical training programs, or the potential for improvement in different populations has been made. In spite of the differences in research methodologies and findings, it is generally agreed upon that physical activities can affect age-related decline in balance performance. Thus, the profession of physical therapy should take a leading role in advocating the use of physical activities to improve balance performance in the elderly to promote active and healthy aging.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to potentially traumatic events is well-known to disrupt cognitions about the self. Among trauma-exposed college students, negative cognitions about the self can include low self-worth and heightened perception of behavioral control over outcomes (i.e., self-controllability), including overevaluation of self-control over weight, shape, and eating behaviors. Thus, posttraumatic cognitions may increase risk for eating pathology. These associations may be particularly heightened among those whose trauma was of a sexual nature, given the stigma and inaccurate rape myths that often place the blame on sexual violence survivors rather than perpetrators. Consistent with these possibilities, the present study tested whether sexual violence history moderated expected associations between lower self-worth and greater eating pathology and between greater self-controllability and eating pathology.",

Growth is generally defined as the change (or rate of change) in one or more continuous measures of size, shape, or composition, usually assessed by anthropometry (see Anthropometry). Indeed, the term growth is often used as a shorthand for child anthropometry. Development reflects maturation as measured by ordinal markers of function; some markers are inherently discontinuous, while others have an underlying continuum. Menarche, the onset of menstruation, is a marker of development, while height gain is a measure of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statistical issues that arise in growth and development fall broadly into two categories: methods for cross-sectional data, notably the construction of growth references, and methods for longitudinal data, particularly growth curve analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\n\r\nanthropometry;\r\nweight;\r\nheight;\r\ngrowth reference;\r\ngrowth curve;\r\nmaturation",

Although junior blue-foots suffer violent subordination, partial starvation, slow growth, and high levels of stress hormone due to abuse by elder siblings, important developmental impacts never materialize. During adulthood, juniors show no deficits in defense of territory, annual survival, cellular immunity, age and date of first breeding, or the number of fledglings produced through age 16 years. Similarly, although one-third of junior human siblings suffer physical, psychological, or relational aggression from siblings on a weekly basis, affecting self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety, interpersonal stress, and depression, rigorous studies found no effects on the major personality traits in adulthood: emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and imagination. Both species may have evolved developmental resilience to the stresses of sibling conflict, a predictable challenge of infancy, and similar resilience has been observed in other wild birds.",

This sexual arousal is based in an organism's biological imperative to reproduce when under stress. Parallels with lower forms of life—cells, plants, and animals—are presented as demonstrating a unity of evolutionary purpose. Autoerotic asphyxia is looked at as a learned technique of enhancing sexual pleasure through hypoxia to the brain. Anaerobic exercise and the accompanying hypoxia is also presented as capable of inducing sexual arousal. Violence is examined as a sexual stimulus, especially as it occurs in sadomasochistic practices, rape, child molesting, and serial killings. All of these aberrant sexual behaviors are seen as stresses which can produce sexual arousal.",

      "abstract": "The literature data and own results, presented in this analysis, seem to indicate that: Intergenerational changes in contemporary man are, not unidirectional and exhibit fluctuations. These changes are directly (environmental factors) or indirectly (external selecting factors) caused by the ecological and social conditions, therefore they are of an adaptational nature. Secular changes in body size, proportions and components, as well as their physiological and motor consequences in contemporary man are mainly caused by abundant nutrition (excess of calories) and a sedentary mode of life, although the selection factor seems to modifie some effects of the above factors, it is definitely less effective and its contribution to the overall processes is much smaller. The rate of progressive development becomes accelerated beginning from infancy and till completion of adolescence, whereas the reproductin period is prolonged and menopause is shifted to a late age, ageing is retarded. This is probably due to better nutrition, shortening of the duration of diseases, improvement of living conditions, and changes in the intensity of stress factors.",

Relevant empirical data, however, have been limited, impressionistic, methodologically questionable, or limited to historically prominent figures. Survey data from the GSS and a study of affirmatively non-theistic and irreligious secular group affiliates in the U.S. do not provide evidence of disproportionately high rates of early parental loss among individuals who describe themselves as “atheist(ic)” or “anti-religious,” reject belief in God, or express strong anger about religion. Loss of a parent or other loved may play a role in turns toward, as well as away from, God and religion for some. There is also evidence of comparatively high rates of parental loss in the lives of historically prominent figures, both religious and non-religious. Present results, however, do not support the hypothesis that early loss is a disproportionately frequent experience in the lives of (“ordinary”) atheistic or irreligious people.",

Body dissatisfaction is a rising issue with young men too, although their average body dissatisfaction remains lower than young women's. Religiosity has been negatively linked to body dissatisfaction for women, but the relation for men is unclear. The current study (N = 5104) built upon a previous latent profile analysis of a large, diverse sample of US. college students Multi-Site University Study of Identity and Culture (MUSIC). We examined whether body dissatisfaction scores were related to three religious classes, when depressive symptoms were controlled for, and whether gender moderated that potential relation. Body dissatisfaction scores were significantly related to religious class. Gender had a main effect although not a moderating effect: men had better body dissatisfaction than women did, and their religious class similarly affected their body dissatisfaction scores. Religiosity appears important for emerging adult men's body dissatisfaction, like for emerging adult women.",

      "abstract": "Emotional eating is an eating behaviour, when someone consuming food in responding to an emotional motivation rather than to a real hunger.These emotional motivations include happiness, sadness, anxiety, depression, fear, anger and loneliness.This could be attributed to psychological, social and cultural factors.Emotional eating is usually identified by over eating food that contains a large amount of energy and fat.It has well been proved that there is a positive relationship between emotional eating and both obesity and disordered eating.It is known that obesity and disordered eating are highly widespread among adolescents in the world.On the other hand, literature considers emotional eating as one of the main factors that causes eating disorders among people.It is important to determine the correlation between eating food and feelings because this information helps in reducing the overeating problem.It is known that both eating disorders and obesity have negative impacts on emotional well-being in the long term, which is difficult to be treated or overcome through traditional way.Therefore, raising awareness about emotional eating and encouraging healthy eating could play a key role in reducing the emotional eating and unhealthy eating behaviours among adolescents.This study uses a mixedmethod through collecting data using questionnaire and oneto-one interview tools.A number of 300 students (ages 12-15) from Riyadh (the capital city of Saudi Arabia) have completed a questionnaire, which designed for this purpose.On the other hand, a number of 15 female students have engaged in a one-to-one interview.The results show that 81.5% of students have emotional eating, however this varies according to the level of the emotional eating among the participants as 27%, 34% and 20.3% of them reported to have high, moderate and weak levels of emotional eating, respectively.The study finds that the factors that promote emotional eating are as follows: Feeling, parents as well as peers and subsequently, social media.Additionally, the majority of the participants (70% of the boys and 94.73% of the girls) are indulged positively in emotional eating (happy eating).The study reports the main factors that encourage boys and girls are as follows, respectively: eating food for the sense of comfort (39.3% and 72%), anxiety (28% and 54%), sadness (17.3% and 34%), and to feel safe (32% and 36%), while hunger is (11.3% and 6%).",

These include youngsters with developmental deficiencies that interfere with their capacity to master the environment. Children with a strong family history of alcoholism or drug abuse also seem to be at high risk. Obviously, there is some overlap between these two groups, not only because parental drug abuse and alcoholism may damage the fetus, but because chemically dependent parents are more likely to abuse or neglect their children because of the impact of their own illness on their functioning as parents. In addition, families in which drug use is modeled as a typical behavior are more likely to produce adolescents who use drugs, although rigid rules against drug use are relatively ineffective in preventing adolescents from experimenting with drugs. Finally, certain behavior patterns in young childhood--particularly severe aggressiveness, rebelliousness, and learning problems at school--seem to be correlated with the development of chemical dependency during adolescence.",

Age at maturity is pivotal, for fitness is often more sensitive to changes in this trait than tq changes in any other. With maturation, selection pressures and trade¬ offs change dramatically. The microevolutionary selection pressures and trade-offs are sketched in the introduction. The demographic pressure to mature early must be balanced by trade-offs with other fitness components to explain delayed maturity. The second section documents variation in age and size at maturity among and within vertebrate classes, among and within populations of single species, and between the two sexes. Species that delay maturity tend to be large, long-lived, and, if they are birds or mammals, to have a few, large offspring, or, if they are reptiles, to have many, small offspring. Much of this pattern is associated with higher taxonomic levels; it weakens but does not disappear within populations.",

      "title": "Insomnia Disorder: Gender Issues Over the Lifespan",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is the most common sleep disorder in the general population, with higher prevalence in women. Three specific periods in a woman's life-puberty, pregnancy and menopause-seem to be associated with marked gender differences in insomnia prevalence. Puberty is a critical stage for the development of insomnia, with an increase in its prevalence among girls after menarche. During pregnancy and the postpartum period, women also report a rise in insomnia symptoms. Various factors, including hormonal, physiological, relational, emotional and environmental ones, can affect sleep during these sensitive times. Furthermore, the transition to menopause tends to exacerbate gender differences in insomnia prevalence, as it is associated with the emergence of physiological and psychological symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, sleep disturbances and mood changes) that can impair sleep. Thus, biological and psychosocial factors seem to explain gender differences in insomnia prevalence and characteristics throughout the lifespan. Considering this framework, this review aims at summarising and deepening the existing empirical literature on gender differences in sleep physiology, insomnia prevalence and clinical characteristics, and predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors for insomnia disorder, in different ages throughout the lifespan. Attention is also given to sexual minority groups, providing a snapshot of sleep difficulties and insomnia symptoms among transgender people. Although the topic is relevant, available literature is still quite scarce. The investigation of gender differences in insomnia disorder could be useful to better understand its prognosis and outline an appropriate and personalised treatment.",

      "abstract": "Variation in mate choice behaviour among females within a population may influence the strength and form of sexual selection, yet the basis for any such variation is still poorly understood. Condition-dependence may be an important source of variation in female sexual responsiveness and in the preference functions for male display traits that she expresses when choosing. We manipulated food intake of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata), and examined the effect on several measures of condition and various components of mate choice behaviour. Diet significantly influenced four measures of female condition: standard length, weight, reproductive status and somatic fat reserves. Diet also significantly affected female sexual responsiveness, but not preference functions: females in good and poor condition prefer the same males. Variation in female condition within populations is therefore unlikely to influence the direction of sexual selection imposed by female choice. It may, however, influence the strength of sexual selection due to its effects on female responsiveness. The relative importance of female choice as a sexually selective force may also covary with female condition, however, because low responsiveness may result in sneak copulations being relatively more important as a determinant of the paternity of offspring. Differences among populations in mean condition may also influence geographic differences in the strength of sexual selection.",

Bu bölümde, yaşlılık döneminde cinsel işlev bozukluklarının ortaya çıkmasına katkı sağlayan durumlar ve yaşlı ile çalışan sağlık profesyonellerinin dikkat etmesi gerekenlerden bahsedilmektedir. Cinsel işlev bozuklukları, bireylerin cinsel uyaranlara gösterdiği fizyolojik yanıt tepkilerinden birinde veya birkaçında ortaya çıkan ve bireylerin cinsel olarak yanıt verme veya cinsel zev- ki deneyimleme yeteneğinde önemli sıkıntılara yol açan bir durumdur. Dünya genelinde, cin- sel işlev bozuklukları kadınlarda %22-46 arasında görülürken erkeklerde %31-39 arasında görülmektedir. Kadınlarda en sık rastlanan cinsel işlev bozukluğu cinsel ilgi/uyarılma bozuk- luğu iken, erkeklerde erken boşalmadır. Bu bozuklukların yaş ile birlikte daha da fazla arttığı bilinmektedir. Yaşlı kadınlarda, menopoz dönemiyle birlikte östrojenin vücuttan çekilmesinden dolayı vajinal sekresyonlarda azalma, disparoni, vajina boyunun kısalması, idrar kaçırma gibi sorunlar yaşamaktadır. Bu sorunlar kadınların cinsel aktiviteden kaçınmalarına yol açar. Bunun yanı sıra bazı kadınlar menopozun üreme yeteneğinin kaybına neden olan bir dönüm noktası olarak tanımlamakla birlikte bu noktadan sonra cinselliğin normal olmayacağını düşünmekte- dirler. Erkeklerde ise testosteron düzeylerinde düşme ile birlikte sertleşme sorunları ve cinsel istek azlığı yaşanmasına rağmen erkeklerde kadınlara göre cinsel işlevlerde ani bir şekilde du- rum değişikliği olmamaktadır. Bu bağlamda, yaşlı bireylere bakım veren sağlık profesyoneller- in bireylerin yaşla birlikte bazı fonksiyonlarında değişimler olacağı ile ilgili bilgilendirilmesi ve bu değişimlerin fizyolojik bir süreç olduğu belirtilmesi ortaya çıkacak cinsel işlev bozuklarının azaltacaktır. Ayrıca bu dönemde yaşlı çiftlere verilecek olan cinsel terapi ile bireylerin mevcut durumundaki cinsel kapasitesinin kabulü sağlanıp toplumsal ön yargılardan uzak ve herhangi bir başarısızlıkla ilgili suçluluk hissetmeden cinsel işlevlerine devam edilmesine katkı sağlaya- caktır. Sonuç olarak sağlık profesyone lleri tarafından yaşlılık döneminde cinsel işlevler hakkında daha fazla hizmet sağlanmalı ve bu cinsel işlev bozukluğu yaşayan kişilere ulaşılmalıdır.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Age differences in future time perspective and the relations between future time perspective, locus of control, and past and anticipated future life events were examined in younger (ages 20 to 37) and older (ages 60 to 81) men and women. There were neither age nor gender differences in the time period participants reported thinking of most frequently. Participants reported thinking about the next few months more frequently than about other future time periods, which ranged from the next few days to many years. However, younger participants also reported thinking frequently about more distant time periods, whereas older subjects did not. Anticipation of discontinuous future events, control of impending events, and positive past events accounted for some age differences found in thinking about distant future time periods. No systematic gender differences were found.",

Similarly in the field of medical sociology when control is mentioned in relation to health and illness it is often presented in a unidimensional manner. This article analyses the relationship between control and responsibility for health in the lay accounts of male Glaswegians. Activist and fatalist dimensions were found in their thinking. However, activist thinking was seen to have three strands: personal activism, social activism, and religious activism. Further, fatalistic thinking was not about passive submission but rather the belief that control lay outwith the person in the realm of the social, natural or supernatural worlds. These findings demonstrate the subtle ways in which people relate to issues of control and responsibility in the health realm – a subtlety which is not fully brought out either in the theoretical or empirical work of social scientists researching in the health field.",

      "abstract": "Thinking about usually brings by feelings of fear and restlessness. Notwithstanding age, gender or profession, the end of life is rather connected to anxiety than to peacefulness. Still, as they get old, people tend to preoccupy more about when and how their life journey would end up. Aging causes varying levels of fear, anxiety, and apprehension each person. Biosocial, cognitive, and psychosocial changes as one ages cause people to realize their own mortality. Attitudes of aging and go together, because as people get older they are concerned with their own mortality (Benton, 2007 Suslick, 2013).Due to the continuous development of technology and life maintaining capabilities within health care systems and also due to improving overall living conditions, life expectancy has increased worldwide. Still, sooner or later does occur and postponing the inevitable cannot help individuals from facing the above mentioned feelings of anxiety while being terminally ill or suffering from incurable diseases. Even if you push a little further away you still get to it one way or another.The dilemmas regarding the end of life are neither of recent date nor are they soon to be vanished away. However, the entire progress aimed at bettering humans' life quality determined the re-emergence of an otherwise ancient paradigm regarding death. The consequence is that the end of life is more often considered a matter of how than a matter of when. Once they succeeded to be more and more control of their own lives, people's concern regarding the final act of their living gained importance also. Still, this approach is by no means recent as people are said to have been interested the topic for thousands of years. As a proof for the ancientness of the preoccupation regarding ones' stands euthanasia, a word considered to be coming from the ancient Greece where the procedure itself was widely practiced cases of incurable diseases (Otlowski, 2000, p.1).For the ancient Greek, was similar to a good/ easy and the values imbued within the construction pointed to the person's dying a dignified manner by dealing away with pain and feelings of helplessness.According to the online edition of the English Oxford Dictionary, the term euthanasia was introduced the basic vocabulary around the 17th century as referring to the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or an irreversible coma. Even if at a first sight the dignifying feature of a non-painful seems to have been left out of the recent definitions of euthanasia, it has been largely invoked by the public opinion especially given the prolongation of life on the one hand and the fact that various illnesses as Alzheimer or AIDS remained incurable on the other hand.Voluntary was not immediately embraced by society as a whole. In fact, was considered a taboo subject for a long time. The Catholic Church has been strongly opposing the concept (Otlowski, 2000, p.2) especially by frequently invoking the Fifth Commandment underling the sacredness of life. Still, secularization has diminished the influence of the Church. Moreover, the media made common knowledge out of the topic by introducing the issue of death on the public agenda. As a matter of consequence, in May 1995, ground breaking legislation was enacted the Northern Territory of Australia with the passage of the rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 which legalizes medical assistance dying certain circumstances (idem).At the moment this paper was written, human and/or physicianassisted suicide had been legalized a few European countries as Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Estonia or Albania and also some parts of the United States of America as Washington or Oregon (http://euthanasia.procon.org). As expected, the procedure is facing greater opposition from people and authorities more traditional countries where individualism and self-determination are not of primary importance. …",

      "title": "HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTH EQUITY: Concepts and Measurement",
      "abstract": "▪ Abstract There is little consensus about the meaning of the terms “health disparities,” “health inequalities,” or “health equity.” The definitions can have important practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups—such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination—systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (“Social advantage” refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category—e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group—and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.",

      "abstract": "The modern period that has taken over the planet has drastically altered every aspect of cultural life. The new styles are so alluring that viewers are constantly drawn to them and end up progressively feeling discontent with their physical appearance in an attempt to improve and mould their ideal body image. The phrase “body image” refers to our thoughts and feelings around our bodies. We can be impacted by our thoughts and sentiments about our bodies for the rest of our life, which can have a wider impact on our mental and physical health and as how we feel about ourselves. Although it’s actually not a mental health issue in and of itself, having body image issues is a somewhat regular occurrence and may increase the chance of developing mental health issues. The issue of body image and appearance can be seen in both children and adults, but it is more prevalent among youths, as they tend to be very conscious about their looks. So this current paper will do a systematic review that how young boys and girls think and feel about their bodies, the more negatively they perceive their appearance and physical form, the more their self-confidence and self-esteem diminish. This significantly affects on their mental health, which gradually hampers their personality development, affecting their future lives and causing their self-confidence to waver, leading their thoughts to shift from positive to negative. This paper will therefore highlight on psychological effect of negative body image and consequences and also how they can be protected from it, so that their self-confidence increases, their feelings of inferiority diminish, their psychological distress is alleviated, and their standard of living rises.",

      "title": "Depression and Psychological Distress",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a common and often-recurrent disorder that impairs functioning and reduces quality of life; it is currently ranked as the largest contributor to disease-related disability worldwide. It is of particular importance for women’s health because, from early adolescence onwards, women are roughly twice as likely as men to experience depression. Depression is a multifactorial disorder, with evidence of influences from genetic and other predisposing individual characteristics, exposure to adverse perinatal and childhood experiences, and more immediately precipitating stressors. As a result, a number of different developmental pathways may be involved, mediated via impacts on aspects of neurobiological, psychological, and social development. This chapter provides an overview of recent evidence on these themes. It begins by sketching epidemiological findings on changing rates and gender ratios in depressive disorders from childhood to older age. It then examines the main domains of risk for depressive conditions, exploring recent evidence on the extent to which men and women differ in exposure or susceptibility to risks that affect both sexes, and whether some gender-specific risks may be involved. Throughout, it highlights the differing pathways through which individual vulnerabilities, childhood adversities, and later stressors have been argued to combine to contribute to the genesis of depression.",

In western societies the emphasized and idealized lean and\r\nskinny female bodies are hardly attainable for the majority of population. Percieving the\r\ndifference between the actual and the idealized bodies can cause serious dissatisfaction,\r\nfrustration or anxiety about the physical appearance. Nowadays women’s bodies\r\nappearing in movies and television are drastically thinner like thirty years ago, and\r\ndieting is a popular and recurrent issue of different television programmes and articles\r\nof female magazines.\r\nAim: The aim of this presentation is to reveal the relationship between the percieved\r\nmedia images and the effect of body dissatisfaction. Relevant studies show great direct\r\neffect of skinny images on body dissatisfaction and percieved anxiety.\r\nResults: Repeated presentation of thin images are associated with the internalization of\r\nthe thin ideal. Some personal characteristics such as overweight, body dissatisfaction,\r\nfrequent self-monitoring or the neccesity to compare the physical appearance to the\r\nothers, are associated with the vulnerability of body dissatisfaction as a result of\r\nviewing thin media images.\r\nConclusion: Many researchers emphasize the association of thin media images with\r\nbody dissatisfaction, body image disturbances and eating disorders.

      "abstract": "Alcoholism is a major problem in India, and there is a large body of literature in India and the West devoted to understanding the marital dynamics involved in drinking and determining the negative effects that alcoholism can have on a spouse's personality and function. Alcoholism is a condition that develops over time and is frequently fatal. It is not a symptom of another sickness or emotional issue, but rather a distinct ailment. A person's size, weight, age, and sex, as well as the amount of food and alcohol ingested, all influence the effects of alcohol use. Even at low doses, alcohol can impair judgement and coordination dramatically. Alcohol in small to moderate dosages can potentially raise the risk of cancer. Low to moderate amounts of alcohol can enhance the likelihood of a number of aggressive behaviours, such as domestic violence and child abuse. Alcohol has a negative impact on not just an individual's physical health, but also on the people around him. Alcoholism is linked to a shattered family role, a breakdown in family communication, as well as physical and mental disorders. Methodology of Study: The current study used a descriptive research design and probability sampling as the sampling method. To obtain data from parents for this study, the researcher used a basic random sampling lottery procedure. An interview schedule was used to acquire a sample size of 60 people.",

The typology is used to analyze the attitudes of young adult non-Catholics toward Catholics and Catholicism and the relationship of these attitudes to intended voting behavior. The data show that preference for Nixon or Kennedy is more closely associated with attitude toward Catholicism than with party affiliation or any other variable tested. Moreover, the extent to which anti-Catholic attitude actually influenced intended voting behavior is shown to be a function of the level of information about the Catholic Church. As was expected, the less informed are more likely to be anti-Catholic than the more informed, but, contrary to expectations, the less informed were less likely to let their attitude influence their vote than the more informed.",

Physical transformation of the body at puberty marks the beginning of a status transition—from childhood to adulthood. A person's sense of identity is vulnerable during a period of marked status change, and this seems particularly true during adolescence. An adolescent's task is to integrate the physical changes of puberty with the psychological transformation into adulthood. At a critical level of maturity prior to puberty, the hypothalamus, a control center in the brain regulating states such as hunger and thirst, relays a message to the pituitary. Although the psychological ramifications of physical maturation have been taken into account, little has been said about the social transition into adulthood that also takes place during adolescence. Adulthood is no longer defined solely in terms of physical size or capacity for mature sexual functioning. Rather, economic and educational criteria are more often used to signify adulthood. Age at which indicators of adulthood are attained has been progressively postponed. In many nontechnological societies, dramatic ceremonies were traditionally held to confer adult status and, thereby, avoid the gap between physical and social maturity.",

Also, a physical or psychological deviation that sometimes suggests a person’s weakness in others can cause a sense of dominance and superiority, which in certain situations can turn into the intention of physical or emotional abuse. Unfortunately, statistics show that a greater number of people with disabilities have faced some types of violence to a greater or lesser extent, especially in the female population. Violence can have numerous and psychophysical severe consequences on people who are already struggling with health, functional and/or mental disorders and consequently have difficulties in realizing the required quality of life and human rights. For this reason, the task of the entire society should be aimed at preventing a spiral mechanism in which one fateful unfavourable situation, such as disability, triggers a series of others. Regardless of its potential, every being deserves care and protection, especially vulnerable groups whose suffering, pain or limitations are seen as their inevitable destiny. However, the strength, fighting spirit and dedication shown by people with disabilities are proof of their magnificence, which should not be rewarded with verbal or physical blows, but with tolerance, respect, and appreciation.",

Women's low status relative to men and their biological role in reproduction often puts them at higher risk than men for many nutritional problems. A major underlying cause of malnutrition is poverty, and it is within settings of poverty that the social vulnerability of females increases the risk for nutritional problems. Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to social pressure about body image, and this may lead to eating disorders that can have severe and sometimes irreversible nutritional consequences. Although the social position of women rises with age in some cultures, many older women may become more socially vulnerable as they become marginalized. The goal of improving women's nutrition will only be accomplished by working with women and their communities to define and act upon meeting their nutritional needs.",

      "abstract": "The variations in socioeconomic status (SES) between different social classes of a population correspond to differences in accessibility to all resources available and able to improve global health. SES can influence global health trajectory for an individual or a community, depending if SES is low or high. Sleep is sensitive to environmental stimuli, as well as living conditions. Plenty of studies linked sleep complaints with mood disorders, allostatic load or circadian disruption; but very few or none investigated deeply what happened earlier to sleep depending of SES. While SES is now known as one of the main determinants for a good health and a good aging, its influence on sleep disorders (SD) is not well understood. SES is a concept, not directly observable but estimated using indicators like income, education, occupational status and area of living. Even if recent evidence suggested that few of SES indicators like occupational status are linked with sleep disturbances, the relation between SES and health in general with sleep as an outcome or a mediator is not well documented. This scoping review synthetized studies which investigated physiological and psychological mechanisms resulting from a low SES and linked them with sleep disturbances as consequences or as mediators. This review also explore a possible role played by sleep in the relation between socioeconomic status and health inequalities.",

      "abstract": "In Westernised societies, women are subjected to cultural pressures to be slim. Women participating in sport and exercise are under these broad cultural pressures, as well as additional pressures to conform to a particular body type relating to their sport or preferred mode of exercise. For instance, in sports with an aesthetic, antigravitational, or weight category component, there is pressure to be lean; in other sports, there may be pressures to conform to a muscular ideal to confer a performance advantage. These subcultural and societal expectations may sometimes clash and can also lead to body dissatisfaction if women perceive a mismatch between their own body and these body ideals. In this chapter, the effects of subcultural and societal pressures on body image among women who exercise are analysed, along with a consideration of what kinds of interventions might promote positive body image among exercising females.",

      "abstract": "El ejercicio con pesas, orientado sobre todo a la musculación, es una práctica antigua que, de un tiempo a esta parte ha cobrado un notable auge. La proliferación de gimnasios y de usuarios de los mismos corre pareja al incremento de dicha práctica. Cada vez más personas se preocupan por la condición física y parte de esas personas lo hacen además por la forma corporal. Ello ha dado lugar a diversas variedades de entrenamiento: fitness, musculación, culturismo. Actualmente existen máquinas destinadas al entrenamiento específico de músculos concretos y/o de grupos musculares que permiten una definición cada vez más precisa del contorno de la figura humana de acuerdo con los cánones del fisioculturismo. Aunque estas prácticas van extendiéndose por ambos sexos, todavía hoy son relativamente escasas entre mujeres, si se las compara con los hombres. Un cierto peligro que puede derivarse de ellas es que puedan crear cierta adicción negativa entre sus practicantes, con todo lo que ello conlleva. Un objetivo de este trabajo y de otros relacionados, actualmente en marcha, es tratar de investigar si hay diferencias entre tales personas y los usuarios de gimnasios cuya finalidad es adquirir / mantener una buena condición física, por razones, sobre todo, de salud. De encontrarse, esas diferencias podrían tal vez utilizarse como indicadores de riesgo de posibles trastornos asociados, como por ejemplo la vigorexia. En el presente estudio nos centramos en las características que definen el perfil social y deportivo de unos y otros, encontrando algunos aspectos en los que realmente son distintos: el estado civil (parcialmente), el nivel de estudios (superior entre los culturistas), la motivación (inicio, objetivos), los hábitos alimentarios (dietas, complementos), o la opinión acerca de ciertas sustancias ergogénicas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article is concerned with choices that parents or guardians make about the food they give to their children. Those with primary responsibility for the care of young children determine the set of foods that their children eat and have a significant impact on children’s subsequent dietary choices, both in later childhood and in adulthood. I argue that parents have a morally significant reason not to feed meat to their children, which stems from their fiduciary responsibility for the child’s moral development. This should, at a minimum, be factored into parental decisions about their children’s diet. In the absence of compelling countervailing reasons, it will mean that parents should not, in an all-things-considered sense, feed meat to their children. This claim does not rely upon the obviously contentious claim that it is morally wrong to eat meat. Instead, the fact that children, when adults, may reasonably themselves come to believe that consuming meat is wrong gives parents morally compelling reasons to avoid acting in ways which may have the predictable consequence of corrupting the moral character of those for whom they are responsible.",

That is not to say that children and adults do not engage in similar behaviors; however, such behaviors are more numerous and extreme during adolescence. This may be one of the reasons why during adolescence young people are at a much greater risk of injury or death as a result of placing themselves in harm's way. It is also during adolescence that behaviors associated with experimentation (i.e., illicit drug use, alcohol consumption, and unprotected sex) can lead to aversive outcomes, largely as a consequence of preventable risk taking. Interestingly, there appears to be a neurobiological link to adolescent risk taking and impulsivity, which when considered offers a framework for understanding and engaging adolescents that goes beyond culture and context.",

In thinking of the enhancement, improvement or perfection of the body through technological interventions, we ought to acknowledge limits in our outlook at least as seriously as we enjoy the considerable advances offered by technology in general. In postulating the chance of enhancement, improvement and perfection it is important to think about the distinction between what we can and what we ought to do. In terms of scientific advance, this is not necessarily reflected clearly – it is often the case that scientific advance per se is taken to be ''progress.'' Progress in scientific research isn't an easy notion in itself. Human progress, in being highly open to nuance and value, draws upon evaluation across a range of validity spheres. In tying a too-uncomplicated notion of scientific progress to the issue of human progress, there is a risk that we evaluate too narrowly our chances and our options.",

      "title": "Lifestyle Behaviours and Personal Responsibility for Health",
      "abstract": "Abstract Deleterious lifestyle behaviours pose a formidable threat to public health but one for which the solution – modest changes in lifestyle choices is tantalising low cost and nontoxic. Personal responsibility for lifestyle choices, once a government mantra, is increasingly being challenged as the complex relationships between sociocultural and environmental conditions and personal choice are recognised. Individuals make frequent lifestyle choices that affect their health and it is intuitively assumed that these choices are made through free will. However, it is argued that in order for an individual to be considered fully responsible, certain preconditions must ideally be met; their actions must be informed, voluntary, uncoerced, spontaneous and deliberated. These preconditions are problematic when applied to lifestyle behaviours. They fail to acknowledge that health behaviours are influenced by many competing factors: cultural pressures, health literacy, health inequalities, mental capacity, genetic predisposition and in the case of smoking and alcohol, addiction to a substance. Understanding which risk factors are within or outside of the individual's control is necessary when discussing responsibility for health. A balanced opinion would therefore suggest that lifestyle behaviours are influenced by a complex interplay of intrapersonal and extrapersonal factors. And responsibility varies for individuals along a continuum. Key Concepts: Individual personal responsibility for lifestyle choices lies on a continuum between complete free will and no choice. Individual personal responsibility for health is dependent on cultural pressures, health literacy, health inequalities, mental capacity, genetic predisposition and in the case of smoking and alcohol, addiction to a substance. Health behaviour is determined in part by perceptions of control over performance of the behaviour which will vary from individual to individual. Advances in our understanding of the genetic aetiology of so‐called lifestyle diseases and their associated behaviours present new challenges for determining those risk factors that are under a person's control and those that are outside of it. Providing people with genetic risk information may induce a sense of ‘fatalism’, the belief that little can be done to reduce the risk. Fatalism may be particularly relevant to perceptions of responsibility and control now that many diseases are thought to have a genetic aetiology. Habit and addiction introduce an additional layer of complexity when debating personal responsibility for health. The very nature of dependency suggests that the individual is unable to control their use of a substance which is usually damaging to health. Determining the precise degree by which an individual is responsible for lifestyle‐related health outcomes is complex and problematic.",

Ein Mann, der vielleicht mehrmals täglich in der Lage ist, einen Geschlechtsverkehr durchzuführen, gilt allgemein auch als besonders fruchtbar. In Herrenwitzen wird ihm auch noch eine besondere Penisgröße und ein muskulöser Habitus zugesprochen. Diese Vorstellungen sind in der Realität absurd und sachlich nicht haltbar. Da besonders sensible Männer, die anatomisch nicht diesen Vorstellungen entsprechen, manchmal darunter leiden, scheint es uns besonders wichtig, diese Phantasievorstellungen auszuräumen. Die Penisgröße erlaubt im Allgemeinen keinerlei Aussagen über die Potenz des Mannes, noch sind muskulöse Männer in der Regel sexuell aktiver als schmalbrüstige Schreibtischarbeiter.

      "abstract": "Adolescent suicide is today a public health problem among the leading cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults. There seems to be many reasons for this increase (which has different trends in different populations), but associations have been found with increased substance abuse, television and video violence, socio-economic status and easy access to firearms. Gender differences have also been observed with crime, suicide and substance abuse higher among males, while eating disorder, depression and suicidal behavior more prevalent among females. This paper will review prevalence and incidence of adolescent suicidal behavior, socio-demographic and psychological risk factors, associated cognitive factors and socio-economic factors. Risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a history of others in the family who have been suicidal, mental illness, alcohol and drug use, and other self-destructive behaviors as well as consideration being given to hopelessness, hostility, negative self-concept and isolation. At the individual difference level, factors such as trait depression, anger and hostility, perfectionism and social sensitivity would seem critical variables, as would age, gender and intellectual functioning. Sociological and family-related factors may also be implicated including dysfunctional family organizations, a history of physical or psychological abuse (sexual abuse) and limited extent of social support networks. A frequently reported precipitating event of suicidal behavior is family adversity including rejection, separation and interpersonal conflict. At a socio-economic level it would seem essential to provide comprehensive document about the social and economic conditions from which the adolescent comes.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Studies of fat distribution have generally relied on the ratio of circumference measurements, such as waist/hip, or waist/thigh. However, these circumferences do not increase at a uniform rate with increasing obesity, and fat is deposited relatively more in the antero‐posterior axis of the trunk and limbs than laterally. With weight loss the waist/hip ratio does not change, but the waist/thigh ratio decreases. This is to be expected since in obesity there is a relatively greater deposition of fat at the waist than on the thighs. Serial studies of a small number of subjects with unusually large or small fat depots at particular sites suggest that these characteristics persist after weight loss. It is probable on theoretical grounds that (except in special cases, such as lactation) a similar proportion of fat is gained and lost in all fat depots, although the relative size of these depots differs between individuals.",

      "title": "Implicit Learning and Memory",
      "abstract": "Implicit learning refers to acquiring information about structural relations among objects or events without intending to learn or being aware of what has been learned. Implicit memory refers to instances where the effects of prior experience (usually individual items or events) are revealed even in the absence of conscious recollection of those experiences. Unlike their explicit counterparts, which typically show age‐related declines, age differences are sometimes reduced or eliminated entirely in situations meant to assess implicit learning and memory. Nonetheless, the evidence is mixed and has become increasingly so as studies of implicit learning and memory have increased in number and sophistication. There is growing evidence that there are various forms of implicit learning and memory and that these forms differ both in their neural substrates and in the extent to which they decline with age.",

      "abstract": "Bullying has become a highlighted problem in recent years by observers (or researchers) about education, counseling, psychology, and the development of children and adolescents. One of the things that attracts attention is bullying with the theme of form and weight. Physical differences in the body, especially in obese people, are followed by stigma and negative justification. Internalization of stigma and justification leads to cases of oppression, in some cases, even suicide decisions. The author tries to find a network of theoretical and conceptual relationships between body image, diet, bullying, the role of the media, depression, to the decision to commit suicide from various sources and the results of previous studies. In the end, it seems that the habit of mocking and humiliating someone who is overweight, which we often face every day and is considered normal, can be a more serious problem. Being slim and fat is an option, but setting it as a normal standard can bring stereotypical havoc.",

      "abstract": "Romantic (typically sexual) relationships are important to personal, physical, mental, social, and economic well-being, and to human evolution. Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy and raise important lines of enquiry in the evolutionary and social sciences.",

      "title": "Hearing Loss and the Voice",
      "abstract": "The voice varies according to the context of speech and to the physical and psychological conditions of the human being, and there is always a normal standard for the vocal output. Hearing loss can impair voce production, causing social, educational, and speech limitations, with specific deviation of the communication related to speech and voice. Usually, the voice is not the main focus of the speech-language pathology therapy with individuals with hearing loss, but its deviations can represent such a negative impact on this population that it can interfere on speech intelligibility and crucially compromise the social integration of the individual. The literature vastly explores acoustic and perceptual characteristics of children and adults with hearing loss. Voice problems in individuals with this impairment are directly related to its type and severity, age, gender, and type of hearing device used. While individuals with mild and moderate hearing loss can only present problems with resonance, severely impaired individuals may lack intensity and frequency control, among other alterations. The commonly found vocal deviations include strain, breathiness, roughness, monotone, absence of rhythm, unpleasant quality, hoarseness, vocal fatigue, high pitch, reduced volume, loudness with excessive variation, unbalanced resonance, altered breathing pattern, brusque vocal attack, and imprecise articulation. These characteristics are justified by the incapability of the deaf to control their vocal performance due to the lack of auditory monitoring of their own voice, caused by the hearing loss. Hence, the development of an intelligible speech with a good quality of voice on the hearing impaired is a challenge, despite the sophisticated technological advances of hearing aids, cochlear implants and other implantable devices. The purpose of this chapter is therefore to present an extensive review of the literature and describe our experience regarding the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of voice disorders in individuals with hearing loss.",

It has a determined temporal dimension, although it remains unknown to a given individual. An overview of relevant literature demonstrates that much has been written on the subject of health and ability and it has been quite extensively discussed. Yet this concept remains valid because its meaning is constantly changing. People are not able to completely free themselves from diseases/disabilities. During one’s lifetime one is exposed to periodic or permanent difficulties or limitations. Human life involves functioning on the border of health and disease, full ability and disability. It is important, however, how one deals with difficulties that one must face, who one will meet on one’s way and what kind of help will be offered.

It can enhance educational attainment, occupational opportunities, political power, and social influence. It provides a buffer against income interruptions, medical emergencies, and other crises such as accidents and natural disasters. Wealth can create more wealth when it is reinvested, and it can generate income in the form of interest or dividends. At high levels of wealth, the income it generates can make paid employment unnecessary. Yet even a small amount of savings can improve security, mitigate the effect of job loss and other financial shocks, and improve well-being dramatically. There are, of course, disadvantages of owning wealth as well, but most people agree that having wealth is more desirable than not having it.",

      "title": "Brain health and value diversity: A new implementation field for values-based practice?",
      "abstract": "Brain health and value diversity: A new implementation field for values-based practice?Brain health has recently emerged as an overarching concept encompassing cognitive, sensory, social-emotional, behavioural and motor aspects of brain functioning, enabling individuals to achieve their potential for both health and wellbeing over their life course, independent of the presence or absence of disease. 1 It is contingent on a continuous, complex interplay between interconnected determinants related to physical health, healthy environments, safety and security, learning and social connection, and access to quality services.Even though responsibility for optimizing brain health can be taken at an individual level, brain health is in fact heavily influenced by determinants far beyond the control of individuals and their families.For instance, protection from abuse and maltreatment or equitable access to health services depend on interacting social, financial, and political factors that can often only be minimally influenced by individual or small group initiatives. 2,3In addition, the voice of many people, including the very young, the very old, the sick, the disadvantaged, and those who live in poverty, may not be sufficiently influential, even though the decision-making process crucially affects the brain health and quality of life for these individuals.The breadth of determinants of brain health makes brain health a terrain that is justifiably shaped by a plethora of stakeholders with highly diverse values and hence potentially conflicting interests and albeit different degrees of power.Consequently, decisionmaking in such contexts embodies a thorny process that may render the negligence of the values, viewpoints, and perspectives of those directly involved in a given decision, particularly when the individual capacity to advocate for oneself and the willingness of society and governments to act on behalf of their citizens, are low.Values-based practice (VBP) is a toolkit for balancing interests, wishes, and values in contexts characterized by diverse values, which may be valuable in decision-making related to brain health. 4The implementation of this toolkit in different fields of healthcare (e.g., occupational therapy, orthopedics, primary care, psychiatry, psychology, radiotherapy) has been proposed, and training materials for healthcare professionals have been developed. 5BP aims to include the differences in values, viewpoints, and perspectives of those directly concerned with a given decision so that communication and shared decision-making are facilitated.Based on the legacy of the Popperian open society, 5 VBP treats values in the same way that democracy treats ideas and human voices.Hence, this decision-making toolkit is neither restricted to ethical codes nor prioritizes one value over others.It also does not endorse certain values while excluding others, provided that the values in play are compatible with legal, regulatory, and bioethical frameworks.The emphasis of VBP is on good process rather than predetermined 'correct' outcomes. 6,7Respect for differences between stakeholders results in the creation of a culture of mutual responsibility and in building up a positive relationship between all those concerned, so that everyone feels a sense of ownership of the decision made. 4,6Of note, according to VBP, the perspective of the health service user or of the individuals or community seeking to protect their brain health is the ideal starting point for any decision.This approach minimizes the negligence of the views, needs, values, competencies, resources, and aspirations of those trying to optimize their brain health in contexts where powerful socioeconomic and further interests may be at stake.The 'good process' of VBP is safeguarded by ten principles. 4Four of them pertain to clinical skills and practice -awareness raising regarding the involvement of values in a given decision-making process; use of a clear reasoning strategy to explore value diversity;",

      "abstract": "The article examines the relationship between self-assessment of human greed and assessment of the greed of the others. It has been shown that young people's perceptions of greed are ambivalent: greed is described as a defect, something bad that makes a person vulnerable, lowers his/her self-esteem, causes trouble, prevents him/her from living a full life and reduces the ability to acquire what is desired. On the other hand, young people pay attention to the fact that due to their greed they are careful about their own funds, control costs and consolidate resources for large purchases. The greed of others is also ambiguous: it can be an obstacle to satisfying the desires of young people, or it can be one that does not affect their goals achievements. The greed of the others is an obstacle to satisfying the desires of young people, achieving their goals. The assessment of the others' greed varied depending on the degree of these people intimacy. The characteristics of relatives, friends, people who they study or work with, were similar to the data obtained in the self-assessment of greed. However, when assessing the greed of the people who run the city and the country, the subjects attributed to them a higher degree of greed. The positive connection between the assessment of one's own greed and the assessment of the greed of relatives, friends and colleagues is determined. No significant relationship was found between the assessment of one's own greed and the greed of the people who run a city or country.",

      "title": "THE IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE: IMPORTANȚA ADOPTĂRII UNUI STIL DE VIAȚĂ SĂNĂTOS",
      "abstract": "A healthy lifestyle is a concept that refers not only to the concern for physical health but also to that of mind and soul. Therefore, the concern for physical activity must be extended to activities for the soul and mind.\r\nOften, we humans do not lean toward things that are considered small, such as information about correct eating. More attention is paid to the constant attempt to adapt to new technologies, to science news and much less to a healthy lifestyle as a whole. Therefore, generations that are behind may be considered deficient in a chapter act, given the growing obesity in children, but which is more pronounced in adults as well.\r\nEducating children about correct nutrition, the importance of physical movement and keeping hygiene is essential, because they will become responsible, healthy adults who can pass on accurate personal health information.\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) assessment, health is the state of full physical, spiritual and social well-being, not just the absence of illness or physical defects. Health is influenced by several factors, interdependent, natural and socio-economic. If at the latter we can remember working, living or eating conditions, in the natural ones, we can talk about climate, water, soil, etc.\r\nThe influence of natural and social factors is interconnected, ie the development of industry, transport, city development exerts an influence on the natural composition of water, air, soil, and natural factors affect the population's supply and living conditions, industry development, living, etc. But the essential factor determining the health of man is his way of life, in this notion is the correct working and resting regime, the rational feeding, the maintenance on a correct level of the physical activity, the quenching, the observance of the individual hygiene rules, the renunciation of the harmful daily habits, the ability to maintain neuro-emotional balance in conflict situations.\r\n Rezumat\r\nUn stil de viața sanatos este un concept care se refera nu doar la preocuparea pentru sanatatea fizica, ci și la cea a minții și a sufletului. De aceea, preocuparea pentru activitatea fizica trebuie extinsa și la activitați pentru suflet și minte.\r\nDe multe ori nu ne aplecam spre lucruri considerate „marunte”, precum informarea asupra alimentației corecte. O mai mare atenție se acorda incercarii permanente de adaptare la noile tehnologii, la noutați in materie de știința și mult mai puțin unui mod de viața sanatos, ca intreg. De aceea, generațiile care vin din urma ar putea fi considerate deficitare la acest capitol, având in vedere obezitatea in creștere la copii, dar care se manifesta tot mai accentuat și la adulți.\r\nEducarea copiilor privind alimenația corecta, importanța mișcarii fizice și pastrarea igienei este esențiala, pentru ca astfel, vor ajunge adulți responsabili, sanatoși, care vor putea transmite mai departe o informație corecta privind sanatatea personala. \r\nConform aprecierii Organizației Mondiale a Sanatații (OMS), sanatatea este starea deplinei bunastari fizice, spirituale si sociale, nu numai lipsa bolilor sau a defectelor fizice. Sanatatea este influențata de mai mulți factori interdependenți, naturali și socio-economici.\r\nDaca la cei din urma putem aminti condiții de munca, de trai ori alimentare, la cei naturali, putem vorbi de clima, apa, sol etc. Influenţa factorilor naturali si sociali este interconexata, adica dezvoltarea industriei, transportului, dezvoltarea oraselor exercita o influenţa asupra componenţei naturale a apei, aerului, solului, iar factorii naturali se rasfrâng asupra caracterului alimentarii si condiţiilor de viaţa ale populaţiei, asupra dezvoltarii industriei, alegerii locului de trai etc.\r\nInsa factorul esenţial ce determina sanatatea omului il constituie modul lui de viaţa, in aceasta noţiune intra regimul corect de munca si odihna, alimentarea raţionala, menţinerea la un nivel corect a activitaţii fizice, calirea, respectarea regulilor de igiena individuala, renunţarea la deprinderile cotidiene daunatoare, capacitatea de a menţine echilibrul neuro-emoţional in situaţiile conflictuale.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates whether different dimensions of physiological dysregulation, modeled individually rather than additively mediate racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported health.Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2010) and the Karlson, Hold, and Breen (KHB) mediation model, this paper explores what operationalization of biomarker data most strongly mediate racial/ethnic disparities in poor/fair self-rated health (SRH) among adults in the United States, net of demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and medication controls.Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics had significantly higher odds of reporting poor/fair self-rated health in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. Operationalizations of allostatic load that disaggregate three major dimensions of physiological dysregulation mediate racial/ethnic disparities strongly between non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites, but not between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. Disaggregating these dimensions explains racial/ethnic disparities in poor/fair SRH better than the continuous score. Analyses on sex-specific disparities indicate differences in how individual dimensions of allostatic load contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in poor/fair SRH differently. All individual dimensions are strong determinants of poor/fair SRH for males. In contrast, for females, the only dimension that is significantly associated with poor/fair SRH is inflammation. For the analytic sample, additive biomarker scores fit the data as well or better than other approaches, suggesting that this approach is most appropriate for explaining individual differences. However, in sex-specific analyses, the interactive approach models fit the data best for men and women.Future researchers seeking to explain racial/ethnic disparities in full or sex-stratified samples should consider disaggregating allostatic load by dimension.",

      "abstract": "Data on hypoactive sexual desire, which occurs in patients with hypogonadism, its classification, anatomical features, and the author’s clinical example of castration-induced hypogonadism are presented. It is reported that if castration is carried out before puberty, then sexual desire does not develop, and if after its completion, only a decrease in its intensity is noted. This is due to the fact that hormonal changes that occur during puberty increase the “sensitivity” of the brain, and therefore the “mental component” of sexual desire develops, which does not disappear after castration. It is noted that the dependence of libido and sexual activity of men on androgens is much less than in animals. Moreover, it is reported that this dependence is much less in people with a higher level of intellectual development. However, castration carried out after puberty and even in mature men with extensive experience in sexual life still leads to a weakening of sexual desire and a deterioration in other sexual functions. If we are talking about the assessment of libido, then during the examination it is necessary to analyze the severity of its various components and, in particular, the safety of its sexual component. It also provides data on the weakening of sexual desire caused by diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diseases of internal organs, tumors, other diseases and conditions, exposure to ionizing radiation. The author’s clinical observations are given, where the weakening of sexual desire in persons exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was preceded by its strengthening. Possible mechanisms for the development of sexual dysfunctions associated with exposure to radiation are reported. Also data on hyposexual sexual desire caused by smoking, alcohol and drugs use are provide.",

      "abstract": "The marked demographic change in industrialized countries has increased cross‐disciplinary interest in exploring understandings of aging on a social as well as individual level. Qualitative research in aging studies predominantly views aging as socially constructed. It therefore aims at gaining a better understanding of grand narratives of aging disseminated by powerful sociocultural agents in the media, the legal and political system, medical sciences, and academic institutions, of individual identity constructions in higher age and of how older people incorporate narratives of aging into their life‐course narratives. Neoliberal grand narratives of aging unfold within the binary of progress versus decline discourses. While representations linking aging to decline are characterized by a loss of control over mental and physical capabilities and resultant dependency on family, friends, or the state, the concept of successful aging is based on managing aging by staying autonomous, active, and youthful for as long as possible. Although the successful aging paradigm seems to support a positive view of aging, it not only reproduces gender hierarchies and heteronormativity but it also puts enormous pressure on those trying to meet the standards of successful aging and contributes to the marginalization of anyone who does not want or is not able to comply. An alternative to current sociocultural views of aging might be to approach aging outside of chronological homogenization and standardization and within the context of individual life‐course narratives in which each person constructs meaning, consistency and, ultimately, identity in one's life.",

      "abstract": "In spite of the fact that masturbation involves almost all human beings in every culture, comparatively little has been written on the subject. Until very recently masturbation was defined in the medical literature as a sexual perversion and a damaging activity to be prohibited at all costs. In the beliefs of certain religious faiths masturbation is considered a sin. The evolution of masturbatory activity as observed from infancy through adolescence is presented. Masturbation can be understood as a \"discharge phenomenon\" undertaken to relieve a state of tension existing in the human body. As the child develops he is normally subjected to increased tensions due to restrictions and frustrations forced upon him by the family and culture. Being permitted no normal outlet, he resorts to the release he has known from infancy, and has the fantasy that certain forbidden or temporarily impossible wishes take place. The feelings of guilt, increased by parental attitudes, are associated with a fear of having damaged their sexual organs and a fear of consequent ill health. Excessive masturbation as defined, must be viewed as a symptom of the child's unhappiness or emotional instability. The role of the pediatrician is to explain ordinary masturbation to the parent as a normal physiologic function. When the physician is presented with the problem of a child with excessive masturbation he should attempt to detect factors responsible for an emotional upset.",

      "abstract": "Most studies of adolescent sleep habits show a pattern of decreasing total sleep time, a tendency to delay the timing of sleep, and an increased level of daytime sleepiness. Laboratory tests have shown that adolescents do not have a decreased need for sleep but probably need more sleep than prepubertally. A number of factors affect the development of adolescent sleep patterns. Puberty itself imposes a burden of increased daytime sleepiness with no change in nocturnal sleep. Parental involvement in setting bedtimes wanes, though they become increasingly involved in waking teenagers in the mornings. Curfews and school schedules also affect adolescent sleep patterns, seen most commonly as imposing earlier rise times as the school day begins earlier during the adolescent years. Part-time employment has a significant impact on the sleep patterns of teenagers: those who work more than 20 h each week sleep less, go to bed later, are more sleepy, and drink more caffeine and alcohol. Development of circadian rhythms may also play a role in the phase delay teenagers commonly experience. The primary conclusion is that many adolescents do not get enough sleep. The consequences of the chronic pattern of insufficient sleep are daytime sleepiness, vulnerability to catastrophic accidents, mood and behavior problems, increased vulnerability to drugs and alcohol, and development of major disorders of the sleep/wake cycle. Educational programs hold the promise of improving teenagers' sleep patterns through informing youngsters, parents, and pediatricians about proper sleep hygiene and the risks of poor sleep habits.",

Women and children being most vulnerable are worst affected. The prevalence of Protein Energy Malnutrition (P.E.M.) in children under five years of age is 51 percent. Such a magnitude of malnutrition in a country, where availability of food per capita is more than adequate, points towards the fact that the inequities within the country are at the root of the problem. Poor income is not the only predictor of malnutrition, gender, urban-rural differences in access, utilization and quality of health care also influence health. In addition, there are some underlying factors such as illiteracy, unawareness of the mother about healthy behaviors, lack of decision-making power of women, along with deep-rooted cultural values of a patriarchal system.Malnutrition is caused by a multitude of factors, some of which are biological, others are environmental, cultural or social. Education of the invisible half of the population, who actually look after the children and the family, is an important strategy to alleviate this problem.",

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

Over time, people who encounter more negative interaction with fellow congregants have more doubts about religion, whereas more spiritual support and greater involvement in prayer groups are associated with less religious doubt. People who encounter more negative interaction are more likely to suppress religious doubts, but people who attend Bible study groups are more likely to seek spiritual growth when faced with doubt. Suppressing religious doubt is associated with less favorable health, whereas seeking spiritual growth has no significant effect.",

      "abstract": "The paper raises the problem of the negative impact of patronizing attitude towards older people on their life practices, which is one of the manifestations of ageism. Patronizing behavior that is implemented towards the older generation in the form of simpli-fied language, exaggerated intonations, slow speech, a tendency to make decisions about the life of an elderly person, ignoring his opinion, etc., in turn, can have an infantilizing effect on the elderly person, forcing him to take a subordinate position. The study, based on empirical data, proves that this, in turn, causes self-limiting practices of older peo-ple. Representatives of the older generation who succumb to the influence of the negative social construct of old age transmitted by others, and as a result adopt a subordinate position, have higher risks of minimizing interpersonal, social and creative activity. Their way of life, in comparison with those who oppose the patronizing attitude or evaluate it negatively, is more focused on the “generally ac-cepted”. They are more likely to abandon their goals, plans, due to their own idea that at their age they are “not up to the task”, less often they act contrary to the opinion of others “about the right and wrong at this age”, refusing to defend their position. Accept-ing the patronizing attitude with gratitude, at the same time, they are more likely than those who are annoyed by this attitude to ignore health-saving practices, considering that diseases are an indis-pensable attribute of old age, so it is pointless to fight them. They are more likely to give up pleasures, joys, desired things in favor of younger people, con-sidering themselves unworthy of them. In conclu-sion, the article suggests ways to solve the identi-fied problem.",

      "title": "Demographic and genetic consequences of disturbed sex determination",
      "abstract": "During sex determination, genetic and/or environmental factors determine the cascade of processes of gonad development. Many organisms, therefore, have a developmental window in which their sex determination can be sensitive to, for example, unusual temperatures or chemical pollutants. Disturbed environments can distort population sex ratios and may even cause sex reversal in species with genetic sex determination. The resulting genotype–phenotype mismatches can have long-lasting effects on population demography and genetics. I review the theoretical and empirical work in this context and explore in a simple population model the role of the fitness v yy of chromosomally aberrant YY genotypes that are a consequence of environmentally induced feminization. Low v yy is mostly beneficial for population growth. During feminization, low v yy reduces the proportion of genetic males and hence accelerates population growth, especially at low rates of feminization and at high fitness costs of the feminization itself (i.e. when feminization would otherwise not affect population dynamics much). When sex reversal ceases, low v yy mitigates the negative effects of feminization and can even prevent population extinction. Little is known about v yy in natural populations. The available models now need to be parametrized in order to better predict the long-term consequences of disturbed sex determination. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Adult sex ratios and reproductive decisions: a critical re-examination of sex differences in human and animal societies’.",

The existence of ideal body standards that emerge in society causes many individuals to experience body shaming. So that society has an indicator of a woman's beauty that is seen from her physical appearance. Body shaming is a person's action or treatment in giving bad comments or criticism about someone's physical appearance, whether related to body condition or appearance, which is done consciously or unconsciously. This form of body shaming is dominated by the color, shape and size of the body in the form of verbal communication and some even takes the form of physical violence. The research method uses a qualitative approach, with descriptive methods. Data was taken from in-depth interviews and journal sources. The results of this research show that body shaming still occurs among teenagers. Often body shaming behavior occurs in middle school or high school. The impacts felt are also very bad, namely stress, depression and loss of self-confidence. As a result, victims of body shaming try to change themselves according to the appearance standards that have been constructed by society. Body shaming behavior can cause discrimination and verbal violence against individuals.",

      "abstract": "Obesity has a multifactorial etiology in which the most important factors are related to lifestyle. High prevalence of obesity is basically caused by important changes in nourishment, in the pattern of physical activity and by other sociocultural factors, which have produced a nutritional transition process. Due to the trends of increase and of social differences in obesity, the minorities and populations with lower educational and socioeconomic level can be the most affected groups. In poor people, obesity is associated, among others, with malnutrition episodes in childhood, even during intrauterine life, and also with alimentary, sociocultural and gender factors. The relationship between obesity and socioeconomic condition is very changeable and complex, since the association is different in distinct socioeconomic contexts and it may remain hidden by several factors (physical exercise, diet, psychological factors, heredity, sociocultural factors) that influence the association. The socioeconomic level might determine the presence of obesity, and obesity, in turn, might cause social consequences to the individual (if social mobility is the most relevant factor, obesity is the one that would determine the individual’s social position). The arguments proposed here are sufficient to justify the importance of the problem in Latin America. Thus, it must represent a challenge, principally for researchers and decision makers, translatable in prioritizing obesity in poverty conditions.",

      "abstract": "<h3>To the Editor.—</h3> The article by Manson et al<sup>1</sup>entitled \"Body Weight and Longevity\" represents a worthwhile attempt to eliminate confounding variables in the examination of the relationship between body weight and longevity. Unfortunately, three additional variables that probably should have been looked at have not been. They are (1) physical activity, (2) social status, and (3) diet. Physical inactivity is positively correlated both with greater body weight and with mortality. Therefore, investigations of the relationship between body weight and longevity should include assessments of physical activity. Unfortunately, this is obviously extremely difficult to measure, but again, the failure to look at this variable weakens the establishment of a possible causal relationship between body weight and increased mortality. The second variable, that of social status, should also be examined since persons in the United States with a lower social status also have higher mortality. Lower social status is also",

Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one’s daughter’s sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents’ reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

Researchers have been much concerned with age as a variable but little with the explication of aging as a process. Most authors do not define aging as they use the term or explain how time enters their causal explanations. In this article major concepts of time are reviewed and distinctions are made between physical, biological, psychological, and social time or age, which all might be classified as a variant of calendar time or calendar age, respectively. Recent developments in gerodynamics, however, have given rise to the concepts of intrinsic time and intrinsic age, which are generated by the dynamics of the system. The implications of the major concepts of time and age will be drawn for research on aging.",

      "abstract": "Obesity and related disorders are thought to have their roots in metabolic “thriftiness” that evolved to combat periodic starvation. The association of low birth weight with obesity in later life caused a shift in the concept from thrifty gene to thrifty phenotype or anticipatory fetal programming. The assumption of thriftiness is implicit in obesity research. We examine here, with the help of a mathematical model, the conditions for evolution of thrifty genes or fetal programming for thriftiness. The model suggests that a thrifty gene cannot exist in a stable polymorphic state in a population. The conditions for evolution of thrifty fetal programming are restricted if the correlation between intrauterine and lifetime conditions is poor. Such a correlation is not observed in natural courses of famine. If there is fetal programming for thriftiness, it could have evolved in anticipation of social factors affecting nutrition that can result in a positive correlation.",

      "abstract": "The study is relevant due to, on the one hand, the high importance of human needs in choosing sport and sports improvement, on the other hand, lack of knowledge about the mechanisms of satisfaction of needs and control of this process. In sports science the problem of satisfying the biological and social needs is being studied, but it is important not only to meet the current needs of those involved in sport, but also purposefully control their formation in young athletes at early phases of their occurrence. Thus, it is crucial to form in young athletes the needs for sports knowledge, achievement, belonging, recognition and others that contribute to sports improvement. Despite the existing concepts of human need reduction in the course of his activity, their fragmentation, conceptual and terminological inconsistency, lack of integrating concepts and ideas are observed. Such a state of the range of problems of satisfaction of human needs in the course of his activity makes particularly relevant not only accumulation to find out the problem - managing the satisfaction of social needs of a person engaged in professional sport and formation of important needs in young athletes. The purpose of the study was to develop a conceptual model of human social needs for sports activity. The presented model of social needs satisfaction in sports activity, on the basis of the progressive development of mechanisms of need manifestation helps to explain the sequence and simultaneity of consolidation, interweaving and ordering activity units, which determines readiness for prolonged sports activity in young athletes and increase of athletic performance in skilled athletes.",

E um transtorno que geralmente acomete criancas antes dos tres anos de idade e tem como caracteristica o comprometimento de todo desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor. Segundo a Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais (20/10/2017), qualquer crianca pode desenvolver o autismo, independentemente do sexo, raca, etnia ou classe social.Apesar de inumeras pesquisas, o TEA ainda apresenta causas desconhecidas, em contra partida alguns avancos entao sendo idealizados para se entender e descobrir o que pode ocasionar tal transtorno; Alguns estudos ja conseguem apontar para provaveis fatores geneticos, que podem ser hereditarios, mas tambem e possivel que fatores do ambiente, como infeccoes durante a gestacao, consumo de tipos de alimentos ou contato com substâncias intoxicantes, como o chumbo e mercurio, por exemplo, possam ter grande efeito no desenvolvimento da doenca.Sabendo que, o TEA pode se manifestar como severa implicacao da comunicacao social, afetando as areas de cognicao, linguagem, desenvolvimento motor e social; O enfermeiro tem um papel muito importante tanto para auxiliar no diagnostico precoce, como para o acompanhamento do paciente ou ate mesmo para participar juntamente com a familia no desenvolvimento de atividades para um melhor prognostico. Por isso, a importância de realizar tal pesquisa, ja que o enfermeiro e profissional que esta na linha de frente junto a familia.OBJETIVOContudo, objetivou-se compreender quais as acoes o enfermeiro deve buscar desenvolver, a fim de realizar um atendimento diferenciado com o paciente e os familiares de pessoas com Transtorno de Espectro Autista – TEA.METODOLOGIATrata-se de uma revisao integrativa da literatura, com abordagem qualitativa. A pesquisa foi realizada nos meses de outubro e novembro de 2018. Foi feita uma pesquisa de outros trabalhos ja escritos sobre a tematica, na base de dados online Portal de Periodicos CAPES, atraves dos descritores Transtorno autistico, Enfermagem e Prognostico, utilizando o conectivo booleano – AND. Os criterios de inclusao basearam-se em serem online, gratuitos e escritos no periodo de 2014 a 2018, e os de exclusao foram nao terem traducao para o portugues.Apos a pesquisa com os descritores foram encontrados 558 artigos, que mediante uma selecao com os criterios de inclusao e exclusao, obteve-se 188, e apos uma leitura superficial onde se pode identificar as ideias principais dos mesmos, restaram entao apenas 3, que serviram para o desenvolvimento.RESULTADOSSegundo Souza et al (2017), a maior dificuldade encontrada pelos pais, e que os profissionais nao tem o conhecimento cientifico necessario para lidar com ambos. Os pais dos portadores de TEA sentem se desnorteados, pois nao sabem, muitas vezes quais sao os principais sintomas do autismo, destacando-se entao a importância de um profissional que possua um conhecimento habil com a finalidade se suprir as duvidas e esclarecer os medos.De acordo com Melo et al (2017), o profissional enfermeiro tem um papel fundamental, principalmente na hora da consulta de enfermagem, para avaliar os sinais e sintomas, como tambem para orientar a familia e/ou cuidador, elaborando maneiras para reduzir a repercussao das manifestacoes na vida dos mesmo, visando um bom prognostico.Conforme Fernandes et al (2018), o enfermeiro exerce um papel de imensa grandeza no que diz respeito a mediacao paciente/familia. Para atender criancas com autismo e necessario que ocorra uma compreensao por parte dos profissionais que lidam com essas criancas, essas, por sua vez, precisam confiar piamente no profissional, pois so assim sera possivel uma aproximacao mais efetiva.CONCLUSOES E de extrema importância que os profissionais da enfermagem estejam atuando frente a frente com os familiares a fim de minimizar os efeitos causados pelo diagnostico; Estando sempre disponiveis para esclarecer as duvidas de forma coerente de modo que os familiares possam entender. Alem disso deve-se sempre buscar atualizacoes acerca do autismo e ao cuidado frente a essa problematica a fim de promover uma melhor aceitacao dos envolvidos e um melhor prognostico geral.",

Taking risks with one's health and one's morals tends to decrease significantly with age. Later in life, men, but not women, lowered their financial risk-taking significantly, whereas women reduced their social risk-taking more substantially than men did. \"Risk variables\" are thought to predispose a person or group to some bad consequence and consequently to constitute a danger to well-being.

In this chapter, I argue against this view because it\nover-estimates the importance of declining death rates and underestimates that of adverse\ntrends in a range of non-fatal, chronic health problems, both physical and mental. These\nproblems have their sources in quite fundamental features of modern societies, and\noptimizing wellbeing will mean making correspondingly fundamental social and cultural\nchanges.\nYoung people reﬂect best the tenor and tempo of the times because they are growingup in them. Because of their stages of biological and social development, they are also\nmost vulnerable to social risks. Many of the attitudes and behaviours – even the illnesses – that largely determine adult health have their origins in childhood, adolescence\nand early adulthood. So the health of young people shapes the future health of the\nwhole population: their health is not only important in its own right, or for their sake, it\nis crucial to assessing the overall state and fate of societies.\nI deﬁne health very broadly to include all aspects of wellbeing, not just clinical disease,disorder and disability. I use the terms ‘health’ and ‘wellbeing’ somewhat interchangeably\nand sometimes together to emphasize their many dimensions: illness and wellness, physical and psychological, objective and subjective. My focus, however, is on mental health\nand wellbeing; physical health is discussed elsewhere.",

Nearly all humans spend a vast proportion of their time engaged in work-related activities and their form plays a large role in determining variation in health outcomes both between and within populations. This variation is usually measured in terms of a limited range of indicators, focusing on those easiest to obtain for a wide range of communities. Thus rates of mortality, morbidity, fertility, work capacity, growth and nutritional status are currently the gold standards for appraising the relative outcomes of different behavioral patterns, including outcomes of working behavior. Also important are the more elusive measures of well-being and the less obvious consequences of behaviors for day-to-day maintenance and long-term health. Endocrine data offer real potential for providing insight into the impact of working behavior on health and well-being.",

Each of these offers different predictions regarding the nature of the relationship between religion and health as people grow old. It reviews empirical findings addressing religion, health, and aging. Institutionalized and noninstitutionalized subjects were combined, nearly all of the subjects were females, what was meant by \"religious adjustment\" is uncertain, and the failure to detect a significant difference may have been a function of insufficient statistical power. Reports of statistically significant associations between religion and health and well-being are of two types. First, three studies have linked religious attendance to general measures of personal adjustment or well-being. Second, there is some evidence that nonorganizational religious involvement may, in fact, be inversely related to well-being in the aged, although findings are mixed.",

      "abstract": "Women appear to become more impaired than men after drinking equivalent amounts of alcohol, achieving higher blood alcohol concentrations even when doses are adjusted for body weight. This finding may be attributable in part to gender differences in total body water content. Men and women appear to eliminate approximately the same total amount of alcohol per unit body weight per hour. However, women seem to eliminate significantly more alcohol per unit of lean body mass per hour than men. Some studies report that women are more susceptible than men to alcohol-related impairment of cognitive performance, especially in tasks involving delayed memory or divided attention functions. Psychomotor performance impairment, however, does not appear to be affected by gender. This article provides an overview of alcohol metabolism (pharmacokinetics) and reviews recent studies on gender differences in alcohol absorption, distribution, elimination, and impairment. Speculation that gender differences in alcohol pharmacokinetics or alcohol-induced performance impairment may be caused by the menstrual cycle and variations in female sex hormones are discussed. It is concluded that the menstrual cycle is unlikely to influence alcohol pharmacokinetics.",

Savoring is undoubtedly a broad concept. It can be directed inwardly toward one's inner states of calm, of pride, of love, and more. Savoring is closely linked to many desirable outcomes, including higher rates of subjective well-being or happiness. Savoring has been also proposed as a mechanism through which positive affect broadens awareness, encourages exploration, and expands behavioral skills. A number of studies have identified some interesting individual differences in the ability to savor. Females report a greater tendency to savor, a difference that emerges around age ten and persists throughout the lifespan. Higher levels of trait mindfulness, extraversion, optimism, and affect intensity, and lower levels of neuroticism, guilt, and hopelessness, are associated with a greater perceived capacity to savor the moment.",

The variety and extent of knowledge and ideas is considerable and a summary or review is difficult but some attempt to describe ways of understanding ageing and the position of older people is necessary before proceeding to consider action and risk. It seems to be important to begin with a consideration of attitudes. An important aspect of the core of gerontology has been the stress on normal ageing, on what is usual. Ageing is a process through time and it is therefore appropriate to begin with the developmental view. An associated view of personality development emphasizes the importance of 'life tasks'. Ageing is associated with some decline in organ and tissue function but most of the symptoms and disabilities afflicting old people result from disease.",

Le nombre de consultation pour ce motif a augmenté en France mais à ce jour, aucune étude épidémiologique n’a été menée. Différents facteurs déclenchent le comportement addictif sexuel (émotions positives, négatives, circonstances environnementales). La consommation sexuelle est excessive et concerne différents supports sexuels. Il y a au moins un orgasme quotidien pendant au moins 6 mois mais celui-ci s’accompagne toujours d’une perte contrôle, d’une perte de temps à préparer le comportement, le réaliser ou à récupérer de ses effets. Les patients dépendants au sexe se construisent une deuxième vie et sont dans la crainte permanente que cette vie, toujours dissociée de l’amour, soit découverte. La réalisation fréquente du comportement sexuel addictif altère les obligations professionnelles, familiales ou sociales. La notion de trouble hypersexualité repose sur des critères cliniques suffisamment fréquents et intenses pour entraîner des altérations du fonctionnement personnel et social sur une période d’au moins 6 mois : perte de temps ; comportements répétitifs, réalisés en réponse à un état dépressif, anxieux, à un ennui, à des événements de vie stressants ; difficultés répétées pour contrôler ou réduire de manière significative des fantasmes/envies/activités sexuelles ; engagement répétitif dans des activités sexuelles en dépit du risque de conséquences physiques ou émotionnelles pour soi ou pour les autres ; fréquence et intensité importantes des comportements sexuels. Il existe différentes formes cliniques qui sont la masturbation compulsive, la consommation compulsive de pornographie, le cybersexe, les conversations érotiques au téléphone, la fréquentation compulsive de clubs, et la séduction compulsive. Les complications de cette pathologie peuvent être d’ordre somatique, psychologique et social. La prise en charge doit être intégrée et multimodale en combinant thérapie cognitive et comportementale, soutien, approche pharmacologique, thérapie de couple et groupes d’auto-support.",

      "abstract": "This study builds upon a small but growing literature examining topics such as motivation, decision making, and behavior in light of visceral physiological states such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, and cravings related to addiction. Such seemingly extraneous factors have been shown to affect even expert decision makers in highly consequential realms. Illuminated by diverse fields such as neuroscience, physiology, gastroenterology, gastronomy, nutrition, and economics, the present study forges a path forward into the realm of organizational behavior, exploring the role of visceral states, specifically hunger and satiety, in temporal discounting, risk propensity, and (un)ethicality. It is hypothesized that being in a state of hunger (versus satiety) will cause people to discount the future more (or more strongly desire more imminently available rewards), exhibit higher risk propensity, and act less ethically/more unethically. As a note, for brevity, only the argumentation for temporal discounting is presented here. Fluctuating states of hunger and satiety occur naturally as a result of the myriad physiological, environmental, and subjective determinants of eating behavior. Because we generally fast overnight and sometimes skip meals, such states are part of our everyday lives. Thus, this study has important practical implications for managerial practice, ranging from managing personal decisions making to managing the decision making of others, including when to schedule meetings and negotiations around meal times considering the mindset most appropriate (e.g., risk seeking versus risk averse) given the outcome of preference.",

The critical factor, however, is thought to be dysadaptation, whereby the environmental circumstances in later life do not match those the person is programmed for. This kind of mismatch is particularly likely in migrant populations leaving rural parts of South Asia (where nutrition is sometimes limited) and settling in affluent, nutrition-rich countries. South Asian babies are born small but with relatively well-preserved fat depots, especially on the torso and intra-abdominally. This relative central preservation of fat is a characteristic that remains through life. The thrifty phenotype and related hypotheses attribute it to fetal and early life growth and development. The empirical evidence suggests, however, a modest role for these ideas in explaining disease outcomes in South Asians in adulthood.",

Therefore, age should not be viewed as a bona fide occupational qualification. Instead, each individual should be judged on the basis of his or her functional capabilities. This paper discusses the concept of functional or physiologic age and then considers how functional age can be determined in a specific job-related context. Physiologic age is viewed as a generalized measure of senescence that would be a useful tool for research studies on aging. Functional age could employ many of the marker variables used in the physiologic age (VO2max, strength, etc.) in a task-specific manner. However, since all the variables involve assumptions concerning the rate of decline with age, they may not stand up in a courtroom test. Therefore, the regular use of job-related tests is recommended as an alternative to the use of chronologic or functional age to determine a person's ability to perform on the job.",

Costs may be reflected during the insect's life or as reduced fitness in the progeny. Costs can include high mortality, depletion of energy reserves, low fecundity, delay in oviposition, shortened post-diapause longevity, and missed opportunities as a consequence of lost generations. Costs may differ between males and females, resulting in sex-specific trade-offs that may influence the timing of diapause entry. A few species, however, appear to have escaped obvious costs associated with diapause. Alternatives enable some insects to survive without diapause. These include entering quiescence (a dormant state readily entered and exited in direct response to prevailing conditions), cold hardening without diapause, extending the life cycle without diapause, seeking a favorable environment, and remaining winter-active.",

      "abstract": "The medical “transition” of children with “gender dysphoria” is increasingly normalized in North America, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Although each country has specific national gender identity development services, the rationale for prescribing hormone treatment is broadly similar. A minority rights paradigm underpinned by postmodern theory has gained traction in the past 10 years and has been successful in influencing public policy, the education of pediatricians, endocrinologists, and mental health professionals. In this view, any response other than an affirmation of the child’s claim to be the opposite sex or “born in the wrong body” is understood as a denial of their human rights to have their “outer” body match their authentic “inner” self. The postmodern paradigm has brought about a concomitant shift in the classification of the patient from a child who suffers “gender dysphoria” to a child who is “transgender”. Yet the practice of putting children on a medical pathway brings severe, life-long consequences including bone/skeletal impairment, cardiovascular and surgical complications, reduced sexual functioning, and infertility. Examination of postmodern “transgender” health care reveals it is rarely expert, evidenced-based or objective but on the contrary, is highly politicized and controversial. Although the High Court in the United Kingdom has ruled those children 16 years and under cannot consent to hormone treatment, several lobby groups, as well as the NHS Tavistock and Portman Hospital Trust Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), have been granted legal permission to challenge the ruling. With the example of the United Kingdom, I demonstrate that if the appeal is successful, children’s rights to protection from bodily and psychological harm will continue to be abused by the postmodern social justice paradigm which, in the very name of upholding children’s rights, violates them.",

      "abstract": "A wide‐held assumption is that increased religiousness is associated with stronger perceptions of a conflict between religion and science. This article examines this assumption using four distinct questions asked on the third wave of the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR). Results indicate a variety of viewpoints for constructing the relationship between science and religion, rather than a simple conflict‐compatibility continuum. Further, findings suggest that increased religiousness among emerging adults is associated with a stronger agreement in science and religion’s compatibility, rather than conflict. Incorporating New Age or non‐Western spiritual tradition and a strict adherence to fundamentalist Christian doctrine are associated with complex configurations of beliefs on the relationship between religion and science. Collectively, the findings among emerging adults contradict traditional assumptions about how religious experiences influence beliefs, suggesting that such social factors may influence beliefs and attitudes uniquely at different points in the lifecourse or across generations. More broadly, the findings speak to the ongoing debate about the extent to which differing social experiences may produce consistent or discordant sets of beliefs and values, and in turn how particular configurations may impact strategies of action across a range of life domains.",

L’imagerie du sport feminin est encore aujourd’hui trop influencee par les prejuges misogynes dont sont victimes les sportives : les muscles, les regles ou la presence meme des sportives dans des disciplines percues comme majoritairement masculines font l’objet d’un tabou et de remarques sexistes intolerables. Le manque de representation mediatique a un impact direct sur le developpement professionnel des sportives : les equipes professionnelles de certaines disciplines, comme le rugby, ne sont pas remunerees en dehors des primes de match. Il devient ainsi extremement complexe pour ces sportives de se consacrer uniquement a leur discipline.\r\n\r\nLes femmes cisgenres ne sont pas les seules a etre victimes de discriminations liees a leur genre : les personnes transgenres et/ou non-binaires sont egalement sous-representees, et la cisnormativite des programmes sportifs les contraint a mettre de cote leur volonte et leur sante afin de pouvoir pratiquer leur discipline. Depuis 2003 et jusqu’en 2016, par exemple, les personnes transgenres ne pouvaient participer a une competition olympique qu’apres deux ans de prise d’hormones et apres avoir atteste d’une operation dite de reassignation. Si cette operation n’est desormais plus obligatoire aujourd’hui, de nombreuses normes injustes et ignorantes pesent encore sur les sportif.ve.s transgenres et/ou non-binaires.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa BAFFE organise cette soiree conference afin de lutter contre toutes discriminations liees au genre dans la pratique du sport. Il convient d’agir, autant qu’il nous est possible, pour encourager la possibilite pour tou-te-s, quel que soit leur genre, de pouvoir pratiquer la discipline de son choix avec les memes possibilites et le meme traitement mediatique que les sportifs masculins cisgenres.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a complex of physical, emotional, and behavioral changes occurring in individuals who starve themselves because of an aversion to weight gain. Bulimia involves episodic binge eating, combined with an awareness that the eating pattern is abnormal. Theorists suggest that individuals with anorexia nervosa can be seen as rejecting the traditional female role, while individuals with bulimia can be seen as overidentifying with the traditional female role. The validated Sex Role Ideology Scale by Kalin and Tilby was used to determine if anorexics did in fact have a feminist perspective on women's role in society, and if bulimics had a traditional perspective. Data from the two patient groups (anorexics and bulimics) were compared to those of a control group of university students, matched for sex and age. No significant differences were found on the Sex Role Ideology Scale.",

      "abstract": "The orthodox view of young people's health and wellbeing is of continuing improvement, in line with historical trends. In this chapter, I argue against this view because it over-estimates the importance of declining death rates and underestimates that of adverse trends in a range of non-fatal, chronic health problems, both physical and mental. These problems have their sources in quite fundamental features of modern societies, and optimizing wellbeing will mean making correspondingly fundamental social and cultural changes. Young people reflect best the tenor and tempo of the times because they are growingup in them. Because of their stages of biological and social development, they are also most vulnerable to social risks. Many of the attitudes and behaviours – even the illnesses – that largely determine adult health have their origins in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. So the health of young people shapes the future health of the whole population: their health is not only important in its own right, or for their sake, it is crucial to assessing the overall state and fate of societies. I define health very broadly to include all aspects of wellbeing, not just clinical disease,disorder and disability. I use the terms 'health' and 'wellbeing' somewhat interchangeably and sometimes together to emphasize their many dimensions: illness and wellness, physical and psychological, objective and subjective. My focus, however, is on mental health and wellbeing; physical health is discussed elsewhere.",

People with high self-esteem perceive themselves favorably. They generally like themselves and believe they are competent and capable of handling life’s challenges. Conversely, those with low self-esteem regard themselves as incapable, unlikable, or even unworthy. Low self-esteem is related to depression and a number of psychosomatic ailments such as loss of appetite, insomnia, nervousness, and headaches. On the whole, people with low self-esteem do not feel valued by themselves or by others and doubt their ability to add value. Self-acceptance and self-esteem are thus critical for mattering. Self-esteem has important implications for a host of life domains. Those high in self-esteem experience more positive emotions and are significantly happier than those with low self-esteem. In fact, high self-esteem is considered one of the most dominant predictors of happiness.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a developmental and continues process of change in the individual that start from conception in the uterus and goes on throughout life. There is hardly any society in the world without aging population. Due to improve living standard and health care; the numbers of the elderly are growing rapidly. However, as old age sets in, one is not expected to be strong and agile as before and this group becomes dependent on the younger population. This study is a theoretical review on developmental aspects of aging and the challenges in developing countries. Functionalist disengagement, interactionist activity and Marxist conflict theoretical perspectives were used in analyzing the study. The study found that developmental aspect or process of aging occur biologically or physically, psychologically or mentally and socially or culturally. As person grows old there is generally an increasing risk of diseases and impairment in functioning. Old age reduces productive capacity in individual. Old people in developing countries are faced with numerous challenges such as physical and mental health, poverty and nutrition, shelter, transportation, isolation and loss of respect. The study also found that societal responses to the needs and/or challenges of the elderly have assumed a relatively lack of concern. It was recommended that government in developing countries should include gerontology or sociology of the aged in their school curriculum at both the primary, secondary and tertiary institutions in order to educate students or younger ones on how to give care to the elderly and that government of developing countries should also make sound and viable socio and economic relief laws to cater and care for the elderly as it is obtainable in developed countries. The study concludes that due the impairment in functioning associated with the developmental challenges of aging, there is urgent need for government of developing countries, health workers, family members, social workers and other related care givers to priority attention to the challenges faced by the elderly in developing countries.",

Individuals who are poor are confronted with an unremitting succession of negative life events in the context of chronically stressful, ongoing life conditions such as inadequate housing and dangerous neighborhoods. Adults who are poor also have more mental health problems than their economically advantaged counterparts. The inverse relation between socioeconomic status and various forms of psychological distress and mental disorder is due in part to the increased exposure of the poor to chronic and acute stressors. Vulnerability to stress following negative life events is reported to be higher among African Americans than whites. African Americans may be more distressed than whites at low levels of income because their caste-like inferiorized status thwarts mobility aspirations and results in greater exposure to chronic, ongoing stressors and higher levels of resource deprivation.",

We examine how people's status, focusing on sex, race, age and religion, affects their willingness to accept these three risks. We experimentally measure a person's willingness to accept risk in a Decision Problem, a Risky Dictator Game and a Trust Game. Groups typically considered having lower status in the US - women, minorities, younger people and non-Protestants - are averse to inequality while higher status groups - male, white, older and Protestant decision makers - dislike being betrayed. This heterogeneity in motivation asks for different organizational interventions to decrease distrust depending on a group's status.",

In such a situation, it is harmful and confusing to question sex and gender. Exposure to either a low or high level of endogenous testosterone from puberty is a decisive factor with respect to sexual dimorphism of physical performance. Yet, measurement of testosterone is not the means by which questions of an athlete's eligibility to compete with either women or men are resolved. The authors discuss that it might be justifiable to use the circulating testosterone level as an endocrinological parameter, to try to arrive at an objective criterion in evaluating what separates women and men in sports competitions, which could prevent the initiation of complicated, lengthy and damaging sex and gender verification procedures.",

It describes all three of these lines of argument: obesity as a contributor to depression, depression as a contributor to obesity, and depression and obesity as mutually reinforcing conditions. The chapter briefly summarizes broad patterns evident in associations between depression and obesity. Depression during childhood and adolescence is linked with higher body mass index and elevated risk of obesity by early to mid-adulthood. It is shown that one way in which obesity may act on depression is by increasing the likelihood that individuals will be dissatisfied with their appearance. It is today clear that obesity and depression are linked, though to what degree and through what mechanisms remains the topic of much inquiry.",

A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

      "abstract": "The aetiology of substance use disorders is considered to be multi-factorial as the individual, developmental and contextual dimensions interact together. From the developmental perspective, research has identified several aspects of family environment that are consistently associated with substance use disorders. Parent child interaction and parenting style are the primary focus of research. A conflict ridden and highly authoritarian parent child interaction predicts substance use in the future1. On the other hand, parenting style can both be a risk or a protective factor depending on its characteristics. Parental warmth as well as limit setting could be protective for future substance use2.\r\n\r\nParenting style is not a unitary concept. It is largely dependent on direct factors like parental personality, psychopathology, and substance use and on the indirect effects of other contextual factors like low socio-economic status (LSES), minority status, immediate environmental adversities and children's maladaptive behaviour3. Parental substance use has been consistently linked to substance use in the offspring4,5. Addicted mother's parenting has been characterized by a wide range of deficits starting from neglect, physical or emotional abuse, punishments to excessive control, lack of emotional involvement and inconsistent discipline2. In addition, parental psychopathology like depression, anxiety or antisocial personality and poor coping with stress has been demonstrated to be related with substance use disorders in their children4,6. But this indictment of the parents needs to be seen in the light of the various contextual factors2. This proposition could be more appealing in the traditional societies where there is interdependence and family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. These traditional societies are collectivist (with a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others, and where collective values of the family take precedence over individual values in case of a conflict) that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity7.\r\n\r\nIn the article by Pettenon & colleagues published in this issue8, the perception of parental bonding has been compared between crack cocaine users and non-illicit drug users. The authors examined hospitalized cocaine dependent subjects and non-illicit drug users as control subjects, both from the same geographical area with matched demographic characteristics. Parental bonding instrument (PBI)9 was used to assess various parenting style in both the parents. PBI measures two constructs: care and control. With various permutation and combinations of these constructs, four different styles of parenting are possible: optimal parenting (high care, low control), affectionate control (high care, high control), affectionless control (low care, high control) and neglectful parenting (low care, low control)9. Results of this study demonstrated that crack cocaine users were more likely to perceive their mothers as neglectful and their fathers as carelessly controlling. On the other hand, non-illicit drug users were perceived to have optimal parenting. This study has highlighted the importance of parenting style in the developmental trajectory both as risk factors (for cocaine users) and perhaps as protective factors (for the control subjects) for development of later substance dependence.\r\n\r\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted on an exclusively male clinical sample selected by non-random purposive method. As already acknowledged by the authors, these factors have curbed the generalizability of the study and its strength to establish causality8. But, by choosing clinical population the authors perhaps were able to tap the most severe end of the spectrum of substance use disorder which could be assumed to be homogeneous. They had a reasonably large sample size seemingly adequate for the purpose of the study. To eliminate the effects of the contextual factors like LSES, ethnic minority or adverse residential environment, the study subjects and the controls were matched as per their socio-demography. Hence, the result of ‘disordered’ parental bonding in the cocaine dependent subjects was unlikely to be due to other contextual variables. Additionally, exclusion of these contextual factors has made the association of impaired parental bonding with substance dependence more specific. Nevertheless, there are a few caveats in the study. As the authors have only studied subjects with substance use disorder, there is always a possibility of subjective bias coloured by subjects’ personality and personal experience. Concurrent interview of the parents could have eliminated this possibility. The subjects with cocaine dependence had significantly higher psychiatric co-morbidity than the controls. As it has been amply researched that psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to childhood adversities and impaired parenting, presence of these co-morbidities perhaps confounded the association of parenting style and cocaine dependence10,11. However, epidemiological studies have shown that almost half of those having substance use disorders have a mental illness in their lifetime. The risk of developing a mental illness is 2-4 times more common in subjects with substance dependence than the controls12,13. Hence, it would practically be impossible to find out a substance use disorder group which does not differ significantly from controls with regard to the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is a philosophical controversy in any research directed to the area of parenting style and future psychopathology. The controversy pivots around causality. One is reminded of Freida Fromm-Reichmann's theory of ‘schizophrenogenic mother’, which stated that schizophrenia is ‘caused’ due to unconscious rejection by the mother of the child (who later grows up to develop schizophrenia)14. A commentator has recently observed on its current status: “Today, in light of what we now understand about schizophrenia, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother seems hopelessly mistaken, and more than a little embarrassing”15. Likewise, one has to be careful in the interpretation of this study findings, lest ‘affectionless’, ‘controlling’ and ‘neglecting’ parents are easily labelled as ‘addictogenic’. This could have the appalling potential to inflict pain and burden to the parents who were and would be the primary caregiver for their kids. ‘Blaming’ the parenting style and family interaction for addiction in other family members could, therefore, be a double edged sword and might well be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to remember that the parenting styles reported in this study8 are ‘perceived’ parenting styles rather than actually observed parenting styles. Such perceptions can be distorted through the looking glass of chronic addiction. It is extremely difficult to conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to settle this issue. In an exceptional 30-year prospective study published very recently, unsupportive maternal behaviour, actually observed and rated by a developmental psychologist at eight months of age of the infant, predicted mental health problems in the grown up adults 30 years later16. Such studies are rare to come by. ‘Perceived’ parenting styles in a retrospective recall design cannot, and should not, implicate causality of addiction as ‘addictogenic’ parents. The value of the current study8, therefore, does not lie in inference of causality of any sort, but in the very fact that these ‘perceived’ parenting styles can have important bearing on the course and outcome of the subjects’ substance use trajectory. These need to be considered in the therapy of these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present study by Pettenon & colleagues8 is from Brazil, which is one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries which are developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies. All these countries have their commonalities in the primacy of family or collectivistic society over the individualistic society. Hence, the results of this study could be equally relevant and meaningful for Indian context.",

      "title": "Approach to the Patient: Transgender Youth: Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Compelling studies have demonstrated that \"gender identity\"--a person's inner sense of self as male, female, or occasionally a category other than male or female--is not simply a psychosocial construct, but likely reflects a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. An increasing number of preadolescents and adolescents, identifying as \"transgender\" (a transient or persistent identification with a gender different from their \"natal gender\"--ie, the gender that is assumed based on the physical sex characteristics present at birth), are seeking medical services to enable the development of physical characteristics consistent with their affirmed gender. Such services, including the use of agents to block endogenous puberty at Tanner stage 2 and subsequent use of cross-sex hormones, are based on longitudinal studies demonstrating that those individuals who were first identified as gender-dysphoric in early or middle childhood and who still meet the mental health criteria for being transgender at early puberty are likely to be transgender as adults. Furthermore, onset of puberty in transgender youth is often accompanied by increased \"gender dysphoria\"--clinically significant distress related to the incongruence between one's affirmed gender and one's \"assigned (or natal) gender.\" Studies have shown that such distress may be ameliorated by a \"gender-affirming\" model of care. Although endocrinologists are familiar with concerns surrounding gender identity in patients with disorders of sex development, many providers are unfamiliar with the approach to the evaluation and management of transgender youth without a disorder of sex development. The goals of this article are to review studies that shed light on the biological underpinnings of gender identity, the epidemiology and natural history of transgenderism, current clinical practice guidelines for transgender youth, and limitations and challenges to optimal care. Prospective cohort studies focused on long-term safety and efficacy are needed to optimize medical and mental health care for transgender youth.",

This phenomenon has been shown to be a product of a memory bias, adults are unable to accurately recall what children were like in the past so they impose their current selves onto their memories. In two studies using American adults ( N = 2,764), we seek to connect this finding to age, implicit theories of change, and extend the beliefs in the decline of the youth to new domains. Here we show as people age, they hold harsher beliefs about present children. Those who believe a trait does not change throughout the lifespan exhibit more forgiving attitudes toward the youth of today, believing they may not be in such decline on that trait . Finally, people who are low in a negative trait believe strongly that children are becoming more deficient in that particular trait (e.g., those who are not narcissistic believe the youth are becoming more narcissistic).",

It may be used to tell-tale the health or otherwise during pregnancy of the mother and the unborn baby. During childhood, it can be used to measure growth, health and nutritional status. In adult life, they may depict level of nourishment and may connote some disease states. The records are required in drugs prescription and in designing and choosing the right hospital equipment to use for a patient. Anthropometric measurements are also required in the design of houses, human wears and most industrial designs of products for human uses are based on average anthropometric records of the particular society for which they are meant. A particular anthropometric index however, may vary widely between apparently normal individuals of the same sex, age and race when varying from one societal setting to the other and sometimes within same society based on some factors. These differences often make it difficult to interpret anthropometric measurements as normal or abnormal. What are the determinants of these differences? How should these variations be managed by health workers and other users? The present review intends to present some of these differences in various human categories and suggest in a compact, yet comprehensive form, how to deal with these differences in order to optimize the use of the records.",

While some of the expected group differences did not appear, some significant age and role differences were found. Older women showed less achievement motivation and had a greater need for affiliation than young adult and midlife women. Career women had a more internalized locus of control than homemakers and students.

Unlike boys, girls augment their body fat noticeably at 7 years of age; by 16 years of age girls have twice as much fat as boys.Total body water reflects lean body mass, which is made up primarily of muscle and skeletal tissues. At 9 years of age, total body water increases significantly in boys and signals the onset of more rapid growth in lean body mass. Muscle mass in boys doubles between the ages of 10 and 17 years, and skeletal mass doubles between ages 12 and 16 years. During adolescence boys exceed girls in all body measurements except hip width and body fat.The changes in body constituents during puberty are reflected more impressively by increases in height and weight. The initiation of the adolescent growth spurt precedes the onset of secondary sex characteristics by approximately 1 year in boys and girls.",

Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity.Orgasmic disorders In men, premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. Sexuality has been explained in the Ayurveda classics in detail along with the various disorders related to desire, arousal, orgasmic and sexual pain disorders. The various formulations have been explained in classics to relieve these disorders and help the man to enjoy their sexual life.Considering these issues the need of hour this conceptual study has been carried out to help, support and provide enhanced sexual life with readily available pure botanicals which are time tested evidenced based and 100% safe and effective.",

It is postulated that individual physiological and anatomical variation may be responsible for developing obesity. Girls in poor families develop greater adiposity than their male siblings, a trend not present in richer environments. This indicates strong influence of estrogen on fat accumulation irrespective of poor socioeconomic conditions. Obesity rates in males and females of developed nations are similar, while in poorer nations obesity is much more prevalent in females. Female to male ratio of obesity correlates inversely with gross domestic product. Therefore, the parity of male and female obesity in developed countries may result from male exposure to environmental estrogen-like substances associated with affluence. These hormonally driven mechanisms may be equally active within both sexes in more developed areas, thereby increasing overall obesity.",

The fraction of deaths \"attributed\" to exposure is conventionally derived as the hazard fraction (R - 1)/R, where R is the relative risk of mortality between high and low exposure levels. The fraction of deaths advanced by exposure (the \"etiologic\" fraction) can be substantially larger or smaller: it can be as large as one and as small as 1/e (≈0.37) times the hazard fraction (if the association is causal and zero otherwise). Recent literature reveals misunderstanding about these concepts. Total life years lost in a population due to exposure can be estimated but cannot be disaggregated by age or cause of death. Economic valuation of a change in exposure-related mortality risk to a population is not affected by inability to know the fraction of deaths that are etiologic. When individuals facing larger or smaller changes in mortality risk cannot be identified, the mean change in population hazard is sufficient for valuation; otherwise, the economic value can depend on the distribution of risk reductions.",

      "abstract": "The recent increase in women's participation in physically challenging activities prompted this review of female responses to heat and cold (68 references). Relevant sex differences include hormone levels, anthropometric factors, and body composition. Many studies show that women are less heat tolerant than men, particularly when physical work is required. Much of the difference is related to women's relatively low level of physical fitness and lack of heat acclimatization, which are in turn a result of their traditionally sedentary lifestyle. When work load is adjusted relative to individual capacity, females respond to heat stress much as males do. Acclimatization mechanisms are the same. Women generally have lower sweat rates, an appropriate adjustment to lesser cooling needs. The menstrual cycle has no meaningful effect on heat tolerance. Cold response reflects individual subcutaneous fat thickness, and women have an advantage there, but in extreme cold exposure they may be handicapped by their small muscle mass. Sex per se is but a small factor in determining human thermal responses; individual body size, physical fitness, and state of acclimatization play for more important roles.",

      "title": "Morbid jealousy: The green-eyed monster",
      "abstract": "Jealousy is a commonly experienced emotion which has been observed in infants as young as 5-6 months of age and across the lifespan of an individual. In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

      "abstract": "Mensen worden iedere dag blootgesteld aan merkproducten. Wij communiceren wie wij zijn met de merken van kleding, auto´s en andere dingen waarmee wij ons omringen. In dit proefschrift worden de effecten onderzocht van blootstelling aan merken die een hoge status of hoge aantrekkelijkheid uitstralen op de zelfperceptie en gedrag. Dit onderzoek is verricht vanuit een evolutionair perspectief. De centrale hypothese is dat mannen worden meer beinvloed worden door merken die een hoge status en een hoge competentie uitstralen. Vrouwen worden verwacht meer beinvloed te worden door merken die een hoge fysieke aantrekkelijkheid en een sterke verfijning uitstralen. De resultaten laten zien dat mannen die status consumptie belangrijk vinden, hun status lager waarderen na blootstelling aan een foto van een hoge status auto. Mannen rapporteren ook een lagere assertieve gedragsintentie, en laten lager status gedrag zien na blootstelling aan een man die een hoge merkcompetentie uitstraalt. Mannen blijven echter in dit geval wel een hogere sociale dominantie te rapporteren, terwijl ze dat niet laten zien. Vrouwen waarderen de eigen aantrekkelijk hoger na blootstelling aan foto´s die een hoge fysieke aantrekkelijkheid uitstralen, zeker wanneer zij het belangrijk vinden hun fysieke uiterlijk te vergelijken. Daarnaast rapporteren vrouwen een hogere assertieve gedragsintentie en laten zij meer hoge status gedrag zien na blootstelling aan een vrouw die hoge merkverfijning uitstraalt. De conclusie van dit proefschrift dan mannen zich in het algemeen meer laten intimideren door merken met een hoge status, terwijl vrouwen merken geassocieerd met een hoge aantrekkelijkheid zien als een bron van inspiratie.",

      "abstract": "Expressions of disgust at the idea of eating, handling, or even seeing meat have often been reported in studies of vegetarianism. Reasons for such reactions have rarely, however, been examined. Neither an ethical stance nor health concerns regarding meat consumption obviously indicate such a reaction. This article presents findings from research utilizing in-depth interviews with vegetarians variously motivated by ethical, health, and other concerns and with meat eaters. A clear difference was found in the sample regarding disgust reactions to meat between those who avoided meat consumption for ethical reasons and those who avoided it for reasons of health. Rather than concluding that avoidance of meat stems from revulsion or that revulsion is the consequence of avoidance of meat, the article concludes that meat is a substance that evokes, independently, both ethical concerns and feelings of revulsion and that the latter is heightened by the former.",

The concept talks about how a person should maintain positive attitude towards his/her ageing despite of any physical or mental illness that is associated to ageing. Positive ageing depends on many factors. Factors like financial stability, physical fitness, positive mental status, sociability, and many more have been regarded as contributing factors to gain positive attitude towards ageing. But the main factor that is pre-dominantly seen in India for positivity in ageing is level of Spirituality. This factor contributes to answering vital questions, like what is happening in one’s life, faith upon higher authority, how to be hopeful for future, etc. Spirituality in a broader sense is connecting with someone bigger than the human being itself. Each person has its own perception of spirituality. People associate ageing as a scary process with uncertainty regarding their physical &amp; mental deterioration and financial instability. Spirituality helps in gaining hope and finding a silver lining even in such conditions. Current research aims at establishing spirituality as a critical factor in developing positive outlook in ageing.",

      "abstract": "Although rates of sexual aggression are high among college men who engage in heavy drinking, little is known regarding how often heavy drinking college men initiate unwanted sexual advances towards women that could lead to a potential sexual assault or the reasons why these advances stop or proceed. The present study describes heavy drinking college men’s ( N = 210) initiation of unwanted sexual and social advances towards women, as well as outcomes of these interactions, including how often these behaviors continue, and men’s perception of what stopped the behavior over a 3-month period. Men indicated whether they were in a situation where a sexual partner noted that she does not want sexual activity to proceed further, initiated unwanted sexual contact, initiated unwanted sexual intercourse, attempted to give a woman alcohol when she did not appear to want to drink, or attempted to take a woman to an isolated location when she did not appear to want to go. These unwanted sexual and social advances most often stopped because of women’s verbal resistance (i.e., saying “stop” or “no”), or because men engaged in a discussion regarding the women’s limits or choices. Given that none of the unwanted sexual or social advances stopped because of bystander intervention, the present study highlights the importance of raising awareness of the effectiveness of women’s resistance tactics and continuing to train bystanders to notice and take action to address risky situations.",

They indicate, that both body satisfaction and ideal body image have group specific properties that are absent or less articulated in heterosexual subjects. Homosexual men have a lower level of body satisfaction and evaluate their actual weigh and muscularity more negatively. Homosexual women are less concentrated on physical appearance and more satisfied with their bodies while being more tolerant to obesity. The ideal body image of gay men is less massive and slimmer while having stronger muscularity than the ideal of heterosexual men.

We find a strong positive correlation between debt and weight for women but this seems driven largely by unobservables. In contrast, men with trouble paying their bills are thinner and this is robust to various specification checks.",

      "abstract": "This report was commissioned by the Department of Health (DH) and examines the concept of self-neglect. The relationship between self-neglect and safeguarding in the UK is a difficult one, partly because the current definition of abuse specifies harmful actions by someone other than the individual at risk. Safeguarding Adults Boards’ policies and procedures commonly contain no reference to self-neglect; occasionally they explicitly exclude it or set criteria for its inclusion\r\n\r\nThe perceptions of people who neglect themselves have not been extensively researched, but where they have, emerging themes are pride in self-sufficiency, connectedness to place and possessions and behaviour that attempts to preserve continuity of identity and control. Traumatic histories and life-changing effects are also present in individuals’ own accounts of their situation.\r\n\r\nSelf-neglect is reported mainly as occurring in older people, although it is also associated with mental ill health. Differentiation between inability and unwillingness to care for oneself, and capacity to understand the consequences of one’s actions, are crucial determinants of response. Professional tolerance of self-neglect as lifestyle choice is higher than when it accompanies physical/mental impairment. Professionals express uncertainty about causation and intervention.",

Der Artikel diskutiert die Frage nach übereinstimmenden Persönlichkeitseigenschaften Betroffener und fragt nach Motiven. Anhand von Aussagen von 9 Personen werden Beispiele für auslösende Erfahrungen zitiert. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kindern waren die Betroffenen oft vom Anblick eines Behinderten fasziniert. Im Artikel wird untersucht, ob das entsprechende Körperteil häufiger Erkrankungen zeigte. Geschildert wird typisches Pretending-Verhalten. Geprüft wird, ob es Parallelen zu körperdysmorphen Erkrankungen (BDD), Fetischismus oder Wahn gibt. Diese fielen gering aus, in der Mehrzahl ist der Wunsch auf ein spezifisches Körperteil fixiert, die Betroffenen sind sich der Absonderlichkeit ihres Begehrens völlig bewusst und hadern mit dem Pro und Kontra. Sexuelle Motive fanden sich bei etwa einem Drittel. Einige der Befragten befanden sich in ärztlicher oder psychologischer Behandlung; dies brachte den Amputationswunsch nicht zum Verschwinden. Bei mehreren der unter BIID-Leidenden wechselte der Amputationswunsch von einer Seite auf die andere. Dieser Befund ist mit der gängigen Theorie einer ZNS-Läsion nicht erklärbar. Diese Menschen haben eher das Ideal eines „perfekten” Körpers, der einen Arm oder ein Bein nicht umfasst. Die meisten bewundern die Schönheit eines Stumpfes und sehen Amputierte als „Helden”, die trotz der Behinderung ihr Leben meistern. BIID ist keine einheitliche Störung, sondern man muss mindestens 3 Achsen trennen: 1. Stärke der neuronalen Dysfunktion, 2. psychische Komponenten (z. B. sekundärer Krankheitsgewinn) und 3. Intensität des sexuellen Interesses.",

V sodobni družbi je postal lepotni ideal vitko telo in disciplino, kot lastnost posameznika, sodobna družba nagradi z uspehom. V dolocenih primerih pride do motenj hranjenja, ki spadajo v skupino dusevnih bolezni.\r\nV teoreticnem delu je predstavljen nastanek ideala vitkosti skozi zgodovino in sedanji sodobni lepotni ideal. Da je lepota v danasnji kulturi pomembna, je potrdila raziskava. Izkazalo pa se je, da to ni pogoj za osebno sreco. Predstavljene so motnje hranjenja: anoreksija, bulimija, kompulzivno prenajedanje, ortoreksija in bikoreksija. Pri teh motnjah je potrebno poiskati vzroke, saj pogosto sledijo neželenemu življenjskemu dogodku (zlorabi, izgubi bližje osebe, izgubi službe, alkoholizmu v družini, slabemu solskemu uspehu …). Dolocene osebnostne lastnosti – pridnost, rigidnost, želja ugajati, perfekcionizem, introvertiranost – lahko vplivajo na nastanek motenj hranjenja, ki jih nekateri dejavniki spodbudijo.\r\nDejavnike, ki vplivajo na motnje hranjenja, delimo na tri skupine: biolosko-genetske, socio-kulturne in psiholoske. Družba kot odgovor na družbene norme krivi medije in modno industrijo za nastanek motenj hranjenja. Vplivi medijev na odnos do telesa je viden tudi iz rezultatov raziskave. Posamezniki, ki se primerjajo z osebami iz medijev, bi se prej odlocili za estetsko operacijo in vsekakor bolj pazijo na telesno težo. V Ameriki, Angliji in Nemciji so popularni spletni formi Pro Ana in Pro Mia – v Sloveniji taki forumi, ki promovirajo izrazito vitkost (in s tem anoreksijo in bulimijo) se niso prepoznavni.\r\nRaziskava je potrdila hipotezo, da vec žensk (11,5 %) kot moskih (2,2 %) zboli za motnjami hranjenja in da za motnjami zboli vec mlajsih do 20 let (11,8 %) in do 30\r\nlet (12 %), od 31 do 50 je samo ena oseba s prenizkim ITM, ki ima vpliv na telesno samopodobo. V raziskavi se preverjajo tudi prehranjevalne navade v slovenski družbi.\r\nRaziskava je pokazala, da so pogost pojav v slovenski družbi motnje prehranjevanja, neredno uživanje obrokov, uživanje prevec mascob in sladkorja. Samo polovica posameznikov dnevno uživa sadje in zelenjavo. Pri hranjenju se nacrtno omejuje vec žensk. Telesna teža vpliva na prehranjevalne navade in iz slabih prehranjevalnih navad se lahko razvijejo motnje hranjenja. Dokazana je tudi signifikantnost vpliva sociodemografskih dejavnikov na prehranjevalne navade in na skrb za telo (spol, starost, zakonski stan, izobrazba, izobrazba starsev, kraj bivanja, prihodek).",

We have just seen how the food, diet, and fitness industries, aided by the media, have systematically convinced women that independence means self-improvement, self-control, and the responsibility for achieving the ultra slender body ideal. But the family, school, and peer group also have a role. They reflect and frequently amplify societal norms. These social influences often take the form of rewards and punishments to urge women’s bodies toward thinness. The result creates vast differences in how men and women feel about their bodies.",

      "title": "Male reproductive health and ageing",
      "abstract": "Since antiquity, the waning of male virility with age and the seemingly inexhaustible repertoire of remedies to stave if off have been intertwined human interests in the vain quest for immortality. Advancing age impacts on all aspects of male reproductive health— sexuality, fertility and androgenization. Increasing longevity throughout society creates a compelling need to promote healthy ageing. The resemblance between some features of ageing and those of younger androgen-deficient men, whose disabilities are readily corrected by testosterone replacement, has long raised interest in whether biochemical androgen deficiency in older men contributes actively to their somatic ageing rather than representing simply a passive barometer of health, or an epiphenomenon of the parallel age-related deterioration of the reproductive with nonreproductive systems. However, if declining androgen secretion with advancing age is clinically significant, or even if it can be overcome pharmacologically, androgen therapy has the potential to improve quality of life for older men. Unlike women where menopause demarcates abruptly the virtually complete cessation of gonadal steroid secretion, male reproductive senescence is a gradual, progressive, but inconsistent and incomplete process varying markedly between individuals in tempo and severity, and accentuated by concomitant ill health. Congruent with wider medical priorities in care of the aged, the goal of management is to coexist with, rather than to eradicate, degenerative diseases. More realistic goals are to improve physical and mental functioning and quality of life so as to prolong enjoyable, independent living, to prevent the preventable, and to delay the inevitable.",

      "abstract": "Considerable attention is being paid to the quality of life as men age—and why not? As men age, they still want to remain productive, active and, of course, healthy. Unfortunately, it seems that nature is cruel. For men, this cruelty starts immediately after college, when they begin to notice, ever so subtly, that the refractory period between their erectile events increases. As men enter their forties, they begin to notice that their erections have started to change, such that the erections may not be as rigid as they once were or do not seem to last as long. Some men even begin to lose that “every moment’s interest in sex” that seems to define their persona during youth. This change in sexuality, coupled with the other phenotypic evidence of aging, such as losing one’s hair and increasing one’s waistline, begs the question—what’s next? As most men who have already traveled that road know so well, it does not get any better. What men also have to look forward to with aging is an increasing sense of lethargy, occasional bouts of memory failure, recognition of no longer being a Samson, and, sometimes, depression. Yes, they can become grumpy, overweight, old men.\r\n\r\nThese aforementioned symptoms and signs are referred to as andropause or androgen deficiency of the aging man (ADAM). As men age, their testosterone levels—particularly their free testosterone levels—decrease. There are many reasons for this but, suffice it to say, this does occur in many men. If these symptoms of aging result from a decrease in testosterone levels, it makes sense that such men may benefit from exogenous androgen treatment. Many men opt for this treatment when confronted with their midlife changes because the evidence suggests that many of these afflictions of aging are ameliorated with androgen replacement.",

      "abstract": "As the articles in this special issue demonstrate, gonadal hormones have powerful effects on the development of the brain and behavior in human beings, as in other species. Both androgens and estrogens affect behavior throughout development, from early prenatal life through adulthood, as demonstrated in studies with a variety of methods in several species. High levels of testosterone and other androgens that are present early in development are shown to facilitate the development of male‐typical characteristics, and to inhibit the development of female‐typical characteristics. Some of these effects are suggested to be mediated by the conversion of androgen to estradiol in the brain. Ovarian hormones are also shown to play an important role in the development and maintenance of female‐typical characteristics, and their effects on the brain appear to extend beyond the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Nevertheless, there are not simple relations between the amount of hormone present and behavior. Behavioral effects of hormones are not uniform across behaviors or across individuals. Variations have been shown to relate to the timing of exposure, the organism's sensitivity to the hormones, the specific hormone involved, and modification by the physical and social environment, although not all factors have been studied in all species, and many have not been studied directly in people. The articles in this special issue also describe attempts to identify the mechanisms—neural and basic behavioral—that mediate hormonal effects on complex human behaviors.",

For example, it is developmentally normative for adolescents to take greater risks and show greater susceptibility to peer influences than adults.1 These otherwise normal differences can contribute to behaviors that lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system. Beyond developmental influences, additional risk factors associated with youth ending up in the juvenile justice system are cognitive deficits, low school involvement, living in poverty, or being runaway or homeless.2-3",

Aside from the generally low likelihood of injury from drawing blood, the harms that might result to subjects once the genetic data is obtained range from minor to major, from physiological to psychosocial and even economic. Disclosure of results may cause loss or increased cost of health and/or life insurance, discrimination and stigmatization. In this presentation, I am going to discuss the issue through the followings: Privacy and confidentiality Unlike other kinds of health data, genetic information applies to or is about more than one person. (parents, siblings, children, and perhaps others). Research that includes follow-up studies requires that a subjects unique information be linked to the genetic information. For this and other reasons, many investigators seek to unlink personal identifiers from genetic data or biological specimens. Successful unlinking reduces or eliminates some threats to privacy and confidentiality. Informed consent The participant should be adequately informed. Consent should be free from coercion or undue influence. The participant should be fully competent. Risks of harm The idea of testing can cause pre- and post-test anxiety. Disclosure of results may result in employment and social bias, discrimination and stigmatization. Family members of the index subject may face similar risks of harm. The presentation also tackles the subject of research on stored biological samples and the ethical issues, with discussion of the laws and regulations applicable.",

      "abstract": "The authors consider how heteronormative temporal arrangements regulate fat bodies. Fat bodies, like normative bodies, are made meaningful in relation to normative notions of time. Fat bodies, however, fail to “keep up” with normative tempos. Accordingly, the authors explore how fat bodies are always already positioned outside of these (hetero)normative timelines by analyzing three temporal markers of “straight” life, or normative rites of passage, that mark “progress” in a heteronormative timeline: marriage, reproduction/childrearing, and death. First, the authors argue that subjects are only successful within heteronormative sequential temporal schemes of living if they are normatively sized and shaped, evidenced by discourses encouraging weight loss as a solution to finding a spouse, successfully reproducing and rearing children, and ensuring a long life and garnering wealth to pass onto future generations. Second, they contend that cyclical time governs the ways in which (fat) women’s bodies are managed, specifically regarding the gaining and losing of weight in accordance with normative markers of time. Overall, the authors explore how fat subjects are limited or constricted by chrononormativity. However, rather than positioning these limitations as wholly oppressive of fat subjects, the authors conclude that queer/ed fat temporalities offer opportunities for reimagining different ways of life and time.",

      "abstract": "Animals living in an impoverished environment, i.e., without the possibility of physical and social activity, perform worse on cognitive tests compared to animals in an enriched environment. The same cognitive difference is also observed in humans. However, it is not clear whether this difference is caused by a decrease in cognition due to an impoverished environment or an increase due to an enriched environment. This review discusses the impact of an impoverished environment on cognition in animal experimental studies and human experimental studies with community-dwelling and institutionalized older people. Results show that the cognitive functioning of old rats is more affected by an impoverished environment than young rats. Similarly, sedentary and lonely people (impoverished environment) have worse cognitive functioning and show a faster cognitive decline than physically and socially active people. Institutionalization further aggravates cognitive decline, probably due to the impoverished environment of nursing homes. In institutions, residents spend an unnecessary and excessive amount of time in bed; out of bed they show mainly sedentary or completely passive behavior. In conclusion, older people, especially those that have been institutionalized, have poor levels of physical and social activity, which in turn has a negative impact on cognitive functioning.",

      "title": "The Underlying Interactome of Childhood Obesity: The Potential Role of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Fine-tuning and integration between social rhythms and biological rhythms should be a priority for all, especially for children. As such, the opportunity to sleep should fit the evolving needs for sleep in a child. Unfortunately, children today are highly unlikely to obtain sufficient sleep or live under stable and regular schedules. Poor or dysregulated sleep affects the regulation of homeostatic and hormonal systems underlying somatic and intellectual growth, maturation, and bioenergetics. Therefore, in the prevention and management of childhood obesity, assessments of the “obesogenic” lifestyle, such as dietary and physical activity patterns, need to be coupled with accurate evaluation of the quality and quantity of sleep and with the potential co-existence of sleep-disordered breathing or other sleep disorders. Incorporation of sleep as an integral component of many childhood research studies on obesity should be done a priori rather than as an afterthought. Although parents and health professionals have meticulously delineated,observed, and quantified normal patterns of activities such as eating or playing, the absence of reliable sleep health data in children is all the more puzzling considering that young children engage in sleeping activities more than in any other activity during the 24-hour cycle. Therefore, the most forgotten, overlooked, or even actively ignored behavior of this century is undoubtedly childhood sleep. Trends aiming to reduce sleep in children have emerged, and regrettably continue to gain momentum. In parallel with such undesirable consequences, leading to the blatant disregard of sleep as a vital function rather than a commodity, a reciprocal increase in obesity rates has emerged. The mechanistic links between sleep and metabolism are now emerging, and should prompt incorporation of measures aiming to align sleep with any other antiobesity campaign. To paraphrase a well-known dictum “Somni sano in corpore sano” (healthy sleep in healthy bodies).",

Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families.

      "title": "INDIVIDUAL PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT1",
      "abstract": "One of the perennial concerns of those who are trying to understand the young human organism is with the evaluation of his present status in the light of his earlier development, and as it bears on his future. We are concerned with the cause-effect relationships between various inherent factors and environmental situations, or between early manifestations and later development. We want to be able to predict, to know how, and how early we can tell what a child will turn out to be like. To do this, we set up norms of development, based on the central tendencies and variabilities of healthy children. In applying to these norms the repeated measures of children over time, we have become increasingly aware that the growth of individuals is often unstable. In a given character, such as height, or intelligence, a child may, over a period of years, shift from high to average, to low and back to average again, as compared with his age peers. The very frequency of these shifts leads us to assume that, for the most part, they are normal and healthy patterns of growth. But we should like to understand the reasons for them, in order to insure optimal development. If we can find some condition that is operating to enhance or lower a child's efficiency or to stimulate or hinder growth, then there is the possibility of doing something to control it. But the processes of growth are very complex: it is often difficult to find a plausible event that could make the difference in the developmental trend. Furthermore, such an event may seem relevant for one child, but may make little difference in other children. In our longitudinal studies, where we have made repeated observations on the same children over time, and charted the development of each child in relation to the norms, we find that individual patterns are the rule. It is a rare child who follows the same course in all of the observed variables through all of his growth. To explain these individual patterns, we are repeatedly being forced to re-examine the nature of development, and to reconsider the relevant conditions that can determine the course of growth in an individual organism. If we begin by considering the early stages of the embryo and fetus, it becomes evident that the organism does not start with the discrete structures and functions that we are able to observe and classify later on in child",

Unlike boys, girls augment their body fat noticeably at 7 years of age; by 16 years of age girls have twice as much fat as boys. Total body water reflects lean body mass, which is made up primarily of muscle and skeletal tissues. At 9 years of age, total body water increases significantly in boys and signals the onset of more rapid growth in lean body mass. Muscle mass in boys doubles between the ages of 10 and 17 years, and skeletal mass doubles between ages 12 and 16 years. During adolescence boys exceed girls in all body measurements except hip width and body fat. The changes in body constituents during puberty are reflected more impressively by increases in height and weight.

      "title": "Bio-well Based Stress Management",
      "abstract": "Chronic stress has become a common phenomenon in today’s world. Modern life can be incredibly demanding, and one often feels overwhelmed by the multiple responsibilities and never-ending demands on several fronts. Balancing work, family, relationships, health, and personal interests can be resource intensive, challenging, and at times difficult to manage that can exacerbate the stress and mount undue pressure. The first and foremost victim of this stress is health. When health dwindles, that affects other aspects of life including work and relationship. The human body has its own way to respond to any psychophysical demand or challenge. When faced with a stressor, be it physical, mental, or emotional, the body reacts with a “fight or flight” response. The modern lifestyle induces unique stressors. The digital age, with its constant connectivity, has blurred the lines between work and personal life, leading to an “always-on-culture”. Additionally, social media, economic pressures, and societal expectations contribute significantly to the stress experienced by the individuals. In order to measure and monitor the overall health and level of stress, we use a device Bio-well coupled with trusted and reliable software GDV. Bio-Well GDV, a Gas-Discharged Visualization (GDV) camera and software systems, using Electro-Photonic Imaging (EPI) technique to quickly capture and assess a person’s psycho-somatic &amp; physiological state, stress level, energy reserve and balance involving left vs. right body. Chronic Stress is one of the key contributors to illness, resulting in compromised immunity, and cardio-vascular diseases. Stress management is an art but based on science and its management must be an integral part of the modern life. Stress management not only helps mentally but also provides physical fitness. It can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep quality, and boost the immune system. By understanding the causes of stress and employing effective management techniques, individuals can improve their quality of life and maintain better mental and physical health. In this paper, the Chakras and stress level of the participants was assessed using Bio-well GDV camera as high, moderate and optimal stress.

Notwithstanding the information enclosed herein based on the Bio-well, it should be noted that there are other devices that should be taken into consideration to uncover the psychosomatic profile of the patient to draw a meaningful conclusion.

The maturity of the anthropometric characteristics varies among populations/communities and sexes due to genetic make-up, environment and other concomitants. Present study examined the nature and extent of age related changes in anthropometric and body composition characteristics among the adult Bishnupriya Manipuris of Cachar district, Assam. Some anthropometric data and body composition characteristics analysed and compared between/among 5age cohorts to see age changes. Study results show significant age changes in some anthropometric characteristics and some body composition characteristics. However, age specific changes could not been determined due to small sample size.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating in young men is associated with obesity and metabolic dysfunction, as well as disordered eating attitudes and behaviors. Although preliminary research suggests that Asian American males might be more likely to binge eat and report body image concerns compared with men of other races/ethnicities, few studies have investigated racial variations in this disordered eating behavior and its correlates. The goal of the current study was to examine binge eating, body image concerns, drive for muscularity, and compulsive exercise in a sample of Black, Asian American, and White men (N = 365). Results suggest that men who reported binge eating also reported higher body mass, male body image concerns, internalization of the male body ideal, and compulsive exercise than men who did not engage in binge eating. Asian American men endorsed higher body image concerns relative to White and Black men. Furthermore, compulsive exercise was particularly high among Asian American men with binge eating. Although additional research is needed to examine potential variations in binge eating, body image, and compulsive exercise in diverse racial and ethnic groups, results suggest that Asian American men might be at higher risk for disordered eating attitudes and behaviors consistent with a desire to achieve a muscular body type. Future research should examine cultural factors, such as acculturation, that might contribute to these potentially harmful cognitions and behaviors.",

Some attention should be given to changes in perceptions of obesity, rather than simply changes in actual rates of objective measures of obesity, in part due to the role that social perception plays in actual psychological and social responses to obesity. Whereas many medical and physical consequences of obesity are more directly related to the physiological dangers of excess body weight, many social and psychological consequences of obesity are related to the perceptions of others. Prejudice against obesity is considered as common as racial prejudice. It's important to note that there can be numerous moderator variables that contribute to the relationship between obesity and depression, such as having an under-active thyroid, which has been associated with both obesity and depression. The chapter also discusses eating disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sexual dysfunction, and other psychopathological disorders.",

Genetic differences influence behavioral and biological affectors of food intake. They are also thought to impact on several nutritionally influenced risk factors (e.g., dyslipoproteinemia) and morbid conditions (e.g., diabetes). These issues have been the topic of much research in the past few decades, as evidenced by the multiple review articles cited in this section. In the behavioral domain, the questions are relatively simple. Do genes determine eating behaviors such as how much one eats, preferences for certain types of foods, and frequency or pattern of eating? The current research suggests that there is resemblance among family members for these behaviors, although it is unclear if they are determined by genes, shared environments, or both.",

Although female hormones may increase a woman's readiness to care for an infant, there is no clear cut evidence of a hormonal basis for maternal feelings. A woman's desire to have and raise children is affected by cultural expectations and opportunities. Current analytical thinking, while viewing reproductive choice as being an important component of feminine identity, does not emphasize the necessity of having a child to feel feminine. Once pregnant, the woman works through issues related to body image, relationship with mother and husband, concerns for the fetus, fears about the future and her new vision of herself.",

A person is thus autistic, or not; dyslexic, or not; has adhd , or not, in line with the binary logic which also produces modern concepts of neurodivergence and neurotypicality. However, some do not fall neatly either side of the diagnostic line, but land half-in, half out, giving the line an ontological wobble. This paper explores the experiences of adults who consider themselves autistic, dyslexic, or to have adhd , despite being told that they fall short of a diagnostic threshold, or that assessment is inappropriate or unavailable. It adds to the gathering momentum in Critical Disability Studies which questions the givens of psychopathology and centres ‘becoming’ rather than static, ‘neuro-identity’ as core in understanding human experience. The becoming of those living in diagnostic borderlands can be welcomingly disruptive of those arborescent façades constructed in Western edu-psy-disciplines, and increasingly transported around the globe.",

      "abstract": "People in recent times have become more focused on their body. They find a clear connection of their personality with their physical looks. Also, they attach their appearance or body-image with popular celebrities. In case people find their body image as good, they become satisfied, but if they find it below the 'ideal' type, they become upset. This practice of comparison indicates that people make negative remarks to their own body. Positive body image includes self-satisfaction with the appearance in terms of a given shape, size and weight of a body while negative body image means the dissatisfaction with shape, size and weight of body, and a perceived feeling of loss of sexuality. Notwithstanding the historical trend of women being more conscious of their preserved beauty, modern men have also been anxious of their body image and tried to be manly. This paper tries to explore what do people think about their bodies, how do they perceive their below-average body, what efforts they do make to change their average- or below-average body into a good-looking body, and how do they convert negative body image into a positive one. It finally argues that the labeling of own body is important for both men and women not only to learn types of bodies but also to adapt to them.",

      "abstract": "The Orthomolecular approach medicine has been under constant criticism ever since its origin. One cause for this may be the somewhat conflicting experimental results, but I suggest that an even more important reason for the lack of acceptance results from the traditional conceptual approach towards nutrition. Understanding the nature of this conceptual hindrance may be relevant for the Orthomolecular school in arguing for the general acceptance of the optimal approach. The traditional approach towards nutrition is illustrated by the influential Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). In my opinion RDA also reflects widely accepted attitudes among people, who do not have any primary acquaintance with these recommendations. It seems reasonable familiar-ize oneself with the basis for RDA understand the limitations of the traditional approach. The RDA levels of intake of essential nutrients are considered to be adequate meet the known needs of practically all healthy persons. (RDA, 1980, p.l). However, nutritional is a vague concept and it is not defined in more detail by the RDA. The concept of nutritional gives the false impression that specific amounts of nutrients are required daily, which is not the case. There is a balance in the body: all that is ingested is metabolized other chemical forms or is excreted unaltered from the body in the long term. Larger intakes of nutrients cause faster metabolism and/or excretion. What is important, however, is that the concentrations in the body depend on intake. Larger intakes cause higher steady state concentrations. The concentrations further determine reaction rates and how the body functions. The lack of a biochemical basis for nutritional may be understood even better by considering the physiological roles of essential nutrients (Hemila, 1984). For example, they may function as cofactors of enzymes or they may participate in nonenzymatic reactions. A number of enzymes, but not all of them, need cofactors in order be active. Especially the B-group vitamins are transformed into cofactors in the body. A cofactor (C) binds an inactive apoenzyme (E) and",

      "title": "Genetik, Epigenetik und Umweltfaktoren der Lebenserwartung – Welche Rolle spielt Nature-versus-Nurture beim Altern?",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung In Deutschland und weltweit steigt das Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung immer weiter an. Mit dieser allgemeinen Zunahme des chronologischen Alters wird der Fokus auf das biologische Alter, d. h. den tatsächlichen Gesundheits- und Fitnesszustand, immer wichtiger. Hier stellt sich die zentrale Frage, inwieweit die altersbedingte Abnahme der Fitness genetisch vorbestimmt oder durch Umweltfaktoren und Lebensstil beeinflussbar ist. Bei dieser Nature-versus-Nurture-Debatte haben viele epigenetische Studien in der Alternsforschung interessante Einblicke geliefert. In den meisten Modellorganismen geht das Altern mit bestimmten epigenetischen Veränderungen einher, denen unter anderem durch moderate Kalorienreduzierung oder vermehrte körperliche Aktivität entgegengewirkt werden kann. Da sich diese Interventionen auch positiv auf die Lebensspanne und Gesundheit auswirken, scheint die Epigenetik im Mittelpunkt zwischen Umwelteinflüssen und Alternsprozessen zu stehen. Hierfür spricht auch, dass es im Verlauf des Lebens von eineiigen Zwillingen eine epigenetische Drift gibt, die mit der unterschiedlichen Ausprägung von Alterserscheinungen zusammenhängt. Darüber hinaus lässt sich anhand von DNA-Methylierungsmustern das biologische Alter sehr präzise bestimmen, was die Bedeutung der Epigenetik für das Altern weiter untermauert. Dieser Beitrag gibt eine Übersicht über die Bedeutung von genetischen und epigenetischen Parametern für die Lebenserwartung. Dabei wird ein Augenmerk auf den Möglichkeiten liegen, durch Lebensstil und Umweltfaktoren ein junges Epigenom zu erhalten, um so das biologische Altern zu verlangsamen.",

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of obesity includes but not limited to genetic makeup, unbalance between intake and expenditure, proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, obese and “anti-obese” hormones, and other causes. To lose weight, the best targets are these points. Fat distribution is determined by genetic makeup especially hormones. Too much obese hormones like steroid, estrogen and too less “anti-obese” hormones like endorphin, serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, and testosterone is associated with fat deposit on the buttocks and thigh, namely “fat ass”, which appears an indicator for degree of homosexuality. Obesity is impacted by many factors. These factors include unhealthy lifestyle, metabolic factors, and unresolved frustrations etc. One biggest unresolved frustration is closeted sexual orientation especially homosexuality. Any sexual orientation is normal. Sexual orientation is X-linked and Y-linked traits, passing down from generation to generation. Homosexuality presents in different degree, some are stronger and some are lighter. The phenotype varies among different individuals, the manner, the behavior, the gesture, habit, likes, dislikes, and personalities. Gay marriage is granted in many states. Yet tradition is tradition does. Many folks still live in the dark, which causes lots of stress related work/school problems, smoking/alcohol/substance abuse, mental problems/psychiatric disorders, STDs, inequality for minorities, etc. Even progress had been made, LGBT healthcare is still on the way. Stress related issues, abuse, and mental problems can be managed positively, as well as with the recognition and acceptance by selves, family and friends, and “anti-obese” factors. STDs shall be better prevented with barrier protection and more disciplined sexual practice. Related information and education can be merged into smartphone app and into EMRS for regular visits. Team work among different society and community shall be strengthened. Above all, deal the reality with whole hearts, with love, with positive attitude. Smile, the world will smile at you. Start local, go global. Don’t ever shut the door.",

      "title": "Personalised nutrition: What makes you so special?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Personalised nutrition can be defined as developing unique nutrition guidelines for each individual; precision nutrition seeks to develop effective approaches based on the combination of an individual's genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. The former infers variants that underlie traits are largely fixed ( i.e . stable across time) and appeals to the notion that we are inherently different from one another. The latter opens up the possibility that what we do and where we are may be more important than what we are. While there are undoubtedly a specific minority of individuals who clearly require a more personalised approach to nutrition, several criteria must be fulfilled before we can justify or implement personalised nutrition for the general population. These would include identifying a desired health outcome and a valid predictor of how that outcome changes, which can be measured with sufficient accuracy and exhibit a robust correlation and/or causal relationship in the required direction ( i.e . predictor‐response). Many attempts to personalise nutrition, such as profiling the genome or microbiome, do not currently meet all these criteria. Therefore, we argue that there is presently insufficient rationale for truly personalised nutrition for the majority of people based on the inter‐individual differences that separate them. Conversely, we propose that precision nutrition based on the environmental and/or behavioural ‘lifestyle’ variance within each person may provide a more effective basis for adjusting diet dynamically, with recognition of varying physiological demands and requirements over time.",

The inquiry builds on previous work investigating the same phenomenon in adolescents, and it shows that perceived weight status is not only heritable, but also heritable beyond objective weight. Subjective assessment of physical weight is independent of one’s physical weight and described as “weight identity.” Importantly, significant differences are shown in the heritability of weight identity among men and women. The chapter ends by discussing the potential relevance of these findings for broader social identity research.",

This study examined whether exposure to mass media stories about \"moderate\" super-agers (exemplary cognitive and physical skill levels) versus \"extreme\" super-agers (most extreme cognitive and physical skill levels) impacts young adults' ageism. Undergraduate participants exposed to media portrayals of moderate super-agers reported greater agreement with positive age stereotypes toward older adults, whereas participants exposed to extreme super-agers reported lower levels of ageism as compared to control participants. Based on these findings, young adults may perceive super-agers in a positive manner as super-agers highlight positive attributes. Since super-agers are often portrayed as defying negative stereotypes through diligence and a positive outlook (less so through good genes or access to healthcare), exposure to super-agers could have negative effects, which is an important future direction.",

Evidence suggests that cultural factors are intertwined with these concepts. Exploration of sexual minorities' experiences has been neglected. Recently, a body of evidence is developing concerning this population, with theoretical speculation for changes of “stressors” for future generations and implications, particularly, on mental health. Lesbian and Gay (LG) individuals of faith (or spirituality) are susceptible to unique “stressors”; however, religion can provide a support network providing protective health benefits. This review systematically explores the existing evidence for the subjective experiences and accounts of LG people of faith. Sexual minority individuals who follow a religion or faith can experience good social support, reducing the risk of negative health outcomes, while for others, potentially serious, negative mental and physical health consequences are experienced (e.g., internalised homophobia, anxiety, rejection and suicidal ideation).",

Sexual activity of older people society usually describe using pejorative terms as an inappropriate, bizarre or obscene, but these labels are different than reality. Hormonal changes and other physiological changes associated with aging affect sexual interest. Erectile dysfunction is a problem in men increasing with age. There is no evidence that premature ejaculation is more common in older age. Cross-sectional studies showed no difference in sexual dysfunction between older and younger women. Age is not a barrier to sexually transmitted diseases. The most common pathogenetic factors for male erectile dysfunction are vascular diseases. In women, the most important symptoms of sexual dysfunction are lack of emotional wellbeing and a sense of intimacy during sexual intercourse.",

Study 1 (N = 120) focused on fact-based beliefs and indicated children and adults thought beliefs that were unsupported or contradicted by evidence were controllable, while beliefs supported by evidence were much less controllable. Study 2 (N = 120) focused on value-based beliefs and indicated children and adults thought opinions and immoral beliefs were controllable, while moral beliefs were much less controllable. Developmental differences emerged, such that young children viewed moral beliefs as less free than adults. Our results suggest that judgments of how much of a choice people have over their beliefs greatly depends on the belief in question. Moreover, already at a young age, children have sophisticated intuitions of the controllability of beliefs and how these beliefs are constrained.",

In a recent national poll, 95 percent of Americans professed a belief in God, and 67 to 75 percent of respondents reported that they pray on a daily basis [1]. Research findings showed that although regular attendance at church was not necessary, a strong personal importance placed on spirituality or religion was most protective against major depression in people who were at high familial risk. Religious beliefs serve an important function in the daily lives and attitudes of most of us. Religious activity embraces beliefs, experiences, and practice. Conversely, a person’s fervent religious practices can also signify other, gloomier facets of his or her mental health. The term used to define such a case is hyperreligiosity in the case of religious beliefs. The question of excess or hyper becomes a factor when the religion begins adversely affecting people’s social behavior and their ability to function rationally. A number of potential genetic and pathophysiological causes of violence and aggression have been investigated over recent years. Research now points to the discovery that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of defective emotion regulation circuitry in the brain.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Perspective of Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder that is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions. OCD can occur in a wide range of subtypes, which may include sexual OCD, i.e., the occurrence of intrusive sexual thoughts. People with sexual OCD may experience unwanted obsessive sexual thoughts about a family member, dead or inanimate objects, animals, God, or children, which can range from mild to severe levels of occurrence. The psychodynamic perspective on OCD suggests that the content of obsessive thinking is commonly drawn from primitivized sexuality and aggression. It further suggests that in the absence of key relationships that include emotional proximity, mirroring and containment, and attunement, a child experiences a void-like state. Consequently, the anxiety that arises in the child leads to a form of liveliness in a “dead” inner world. However, it occurs out of a sense of abandonment and loss of good objects, and ultimately out of fear of annihilation. As a result, the child resorts to maladaptive defense mechanisms. The study attempts to explore the adverse early childhood experiences such as parental neglect, mother–father conflict, and lack of parental love and care leading to fixation in psychosexual stages of development, which further leads to the adoption of maladaptive defense mechanisms that in turn further contribute to the development of obsessional personality traits. This study aims to explain the psychodynamic perspective on the emergence of sexual obsessions by proceeding with a case study approach by taking a diagnosed case of OCD. A comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment was conducted with the help of Draw-a-Person Test, Thematic Apperception Test, Rotter’s Incomplete Sentence Blank, and Million’s Comprehensive Multiaxial Inventory. The analysis of the assessment protocol revealed a strong relationship between the defense mechanism, personality traits, and the development of obsessive symptoms.",

A chromosomal abnormality, or chromosomal aberration, is a disorder characterized by a morphological or numerical alteration in single or multiple chromosomes, affecting autosomes, sex chromosomes, or both. The normal human karyotype contains approximately two meters of DNA organized into 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes and a set of sex chromosomes that compromise two X chromosomes in females or an X and a Y chromosome in males. All the genetic necessary for growth and development derive from chromosomes (around 20 to 25 thousand genes). Chromosome abnormalities usually involve an error in cell division (mitosis or meiosis), which may occur in the prenatal, postnatal, or preimplantation periods. These alterations have significant clinical consequences, i.e., spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, neonatal death/hospitalization, malformations, intellectual disability, or an identifiable syndrome. Accurate identification of these chromosomal errors is essential for prevention strategies, genetic counseling, and appropriate treatment.",

Growth follows a consistent sequence, broadly comparable between different individuals, and clear-cut changes occur over a short period so, even taking into account variation within species, age can be estimated with reasonable precision from the state of development. Growth unfolds in different ways for different parts of the body. General or somatic growth is rapid in foetal and early postnatal life, but then slows until the 'growth spurt' of puberty, during which any marker of overall body size increases rapidly. On the attainment of sexual maturity, growth rate falls back as the individual reaches adult size. Genital organs and most secondary sexual characters grow little before puberty, but very rapidly during the somatic growth spurt. Neural structures, by contrast, grow rapidly before birth and during infancy, after which they grow more slowly. Teeth and jaws have their own pattern related to the two dentitions. The deciduous dentition is associated with the shorter face or snout of young animals. Establishment of the permanent dentition is accompanied by elongation of the snout and the eruption of the last teeth marks attainment of adult face proportions.",

Gerontologists with a primary interest in pathology are perhaps more inclined to emphasize disease in relation to aging, but they may be biased, since they commonly see the end-result of illness requiring hospitalization. Certainly pathologists are unlikely to see the few persons who die essentially of uncomplicated old age. The fact that maintenance of various species of animals on a limited diet will prolong life through delaying sexual maturation and prolonging growth still constitutes the strongest support for the view that aging is an endogenous process—a product of reduced growth potential or insufficient rate",

However, sensory responses alone do not predict food consumption. The view that a “sweet tooth” leads to obesity through excess sugar consumption is overly narrow. In reality, there are multiple links between taste perceptions, taste preferences, food preferences, and food choices and the amount of food consumed. Taste responses are influenced by a range of genetic, physiological, and metabolic variables. The impact of taste factors on food intake further depends on sex and age and is modulated by obesity, eating disorders, and other pathologies of eating behavior. Food preferences and food choices of populations are further linked to attitudinal, social, and—probably most important—economic variables such as income. Nutrition education and intervention strategies aimed at improving population diets ought to consider sensory pleasure response to foods, in addition to a wide range of demographic and sociocultural variables.",

      "title": "Wilding liability in education: Introducing the concept of wide risk as counterpoint to narrow-risk-driven educative practice",
      "abstract": "Consideration of risk and liability in outdoor educative practice has normally been limited to the narrow risks, usually to physical health, of incidents that can cause a particular injury. In this view of risk management, the more readily controlled the circumstance, the less likelihood of risk and consequent liability. Thus, to reduce risk, learning in the natural world is often avoided because it occurs in far more complex and less controllable contexts than human-created ones. However, wider and more grave risks to physical, emotional and mental health that may accrue through a life that is lived in separation from the natural world are not often considered or evaluated. In part, this may be because these kinds of risks are less immediately evident, and liability for negative outcomes may be more difficult to measure. Thus, there is less incentive to consider them. However, delayed outcomes are still outcomes. To consider easily discerned narrow risk alone, while ignoring more complex and longer-term wide risk, is no excuse for avoiding the ethical responsibility that public education carries to provide both the safest and most fecund context for learning. This paper introduces the concept of wide risk as a counterpoint to the narrow risk calculations now performed, and argues that in incorporating an understanding of wide risk in educative practice, at least two results are likely. The first is that learning outdoors will frequently be discovered to be a less risky alternative, if a broad range of outcomes over time are considered. The second is that the value of embracing risk in all aspects of learning ought to become a part of the learning process, and part of what is taught in public schools.",

Domestic violence is narrowly defined as an act or threat of violence against someone with whom the perpetrator has a deep relationship. Domestic violence is also closely related to violence against children. While children may not be physically harmed, seeing or hearing their parents being abused can be psychologically devastating. Maturity in Latin verbs is called the term adult or adolescene which means to grow into maturity Adult in Dutch is volwassen which means full and wassen means to grow, so volwassen means that it has fully grown or has finished growing Therefore, adults are individuals who have completed their growth and ready to accept a position in society along with other adults. However, a person's maturity can be disturbed if the child lives in a less harmonious family environment or a broken home, because domestic violence (domestic violence) not only affects the parents but also their children.

      "title": "Male Reproductive Ageing: Human Fertility, Androgens and Hormone Dependent Disease",
      "abstract": "The waning of male virility with age, in all its ambiguities, has always intrigued humans, prompting innumerable approaches to staving it off. In modern terms, advancing age impacts on all aspects of male reproductive health— sexuality, fertility and androgenization— with differing extents and tempo. With ageing, male sexual function declines predominantly due to vasculogenic defects in cavernosal haemodynamics, whereas libido and ejaculation are less affected. This raises the potential for prevention and treatment of erectile dysfunction as an early clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis. After maturity, male fertility persists throughout life but decreases modestly with age presumably due to concomitant decline in sexual activity rather than in sperm output or function, although systematic population studies of the latter are difficult. Male ageing is associated with a progressive, partial and variable degree of androgen deficiency, but the clinical and public health significance remain to be established. Available evidence suggests that androgen supplementation is unlikely to prolong life expectancy but might improve quality of life through prevention of apparently age-related declines in androgen-sensitive tissues. The appropriate target population, treatment modality and objectives remain to be established by further controlled clinical studies.",

      "title": "Early Life and the Development of Resilience",
      "abstract": "Can J Psychiatry. 2011;56(8):445-446. Resilience involves resistance to the negative effects of tragic loss, serious failure or insult, or disturbance of the available social frame. Such experiences may be brought on by loss of valued relationships, abilities or functional level, or sources of support, and is likely to be reflected in symptomatic increase in mental disorder. Thus resilience as an issue is critical at one time or another in a probable large majority of human lives; it refers to the ability to cope with life's nontrivially difficult or unpleasant tasks, situations, or experiences with attitudes and actions that minimize or overcome their negative effects. Such coping involves strategies that include reasonable evaluation of the situation, weighing alternative actions, mechanisms of self-control and confidence, obtaining interpersonal comfort and collaboration, and other help seeking. Abilities to employ such strategies vary among individuals, as does the sensitivity to different kinds of negative experiences. Although these differences are likely influenced by genetic variation, social interactions that shape their development begin in the immediate postnatal period,' when the neonate seeks comfort, warmth, and nourishment. Neonatal offspring of depressed mothers are less responsive to social stimuli2 and biological indicators of these early behaviours1 may be early signs of nonresilient patterns of processing social-behavioural options. In the pre-school period, and increasingly thereafter, children need to understand the origins of their own emotional reactions to positive and negative experiences, as well as those of their peers.4 This understanding will arise from frequent and positive interaction with parents, siblings, and (or) other caretakers, and, normatively, will develop into skills for communicating appropriately with peers. Such understanding and skills may well serve as a basis for resilience in the face of a range of problematic experiences, peers, or negative environments. The papers in this section5,6 provide evidence regarding environmental and developmental processes in later childhood that may promote such resilience. In the first paper, by Dr Jeffrey G Johnson and colleagues,5 substantial and positive parenting during the developmental years, by either or both parents in a general population sample, is shown to be related to a much lower rate not only of the DSM Axis I disorders into young adulthood but also of the personality disorders, which themselves indicate problems in likely resilience skills. The second study, by Dr Stephanie D Stepp and colleagues,6 shows that social competence among inner-city boys as they begin adolescence serves as a protection over time to ongoing exposure to the problematic behaviour and minimized academic efforts that characterize many of their peers in low-income neighbourhoods. Again, this study6 suggests the importance of early training in the understanding of the emotional reactions of peers, as well as one's own, and reinforcement of constructive responses both to peer and to adult expectations. It is likely that these relatively resilient children may also have experienced more positive parenting than those in the same study who failed to show resilient outcomes, but such data were not part of these analyses. …",

      "abstract": "Young and middle-aged adults (79 men and 132 women) filled out a questionnaire which measured their fear of death, neuroticism (guilt-proneness, ego strength, impulsivity, and free-floating anxiety scales from the 16 PF), religiosity, and frequency of thinking about, denial of, and concept of death. Fear of death was associated with denial of death and denial of dying but not with free-floating anxiety, suggesting that fear of death is not a neurotic but a very specific fear. Guilt-prone individuals feared death more, thought about it more, and believed it to be more unnatural. This suggests that guilt-prone individuals may anticipate death as punishment. Those with low ego-strength feared death less if older, but independently of age they thought about it more frequently. Fear of death was much more strongly associated with religiosity and concept of death than any of these variables with the personality traits measured; so it seems that early religious socialization may be more influential for fear of death and concept of death than the specific neurotic characteristics of the person.",

Yet, how physical attractiveness influences earlier consequential decisions is not well understood. This paper estimates the effect of attractiveness in adolescence on one set of consequential outcomes, engagement in risky behaviours. We find robust evidence of marked effects of teenage attractiveness across a range of risky behaviours, including underage drinking, smoking, substance abuse and teenage sexual activity. More attractive individuals are more likely to engage in underage drinking, but markedly less likely to smoke or to be sexually active. Mediation analysis reveals that popularity, self-esteem, and personality attractiveness have roles as underlying mechanisms, yet substantial direct effects of physical attractiveness remain. Our findings suggest physical attractiveness in adolescence carries long-lasting consequences over the life course.",

While the risks associated with increased physical activity are not to be overlooked, more attention is being given to the overwhelming benefits of adequate exercise for the elderly, both in terms of short and long-term contributions to enhanced physical, social and emotional well-being. Conditioned to believe that being old and female is a sort of \"double jeopardy\" requiring restraint in physical activity, elderly women have been slow to respond to the new view of exercise as a crucial part of healthy aging. So long as elderly women do not readily perceive the advantages to be accrued from regular exercise patterns and do not believe they are capable of vigourous physical activity, government policies and plans to disseminate information about health and exercise are unlikely to generale large scale action toward health promotion.",

Hence, miscarriages and failures to conceive can feel devastating. The fact that friends of the same age are having children can heighten these strains. Men with little or no sperm often feel guilty, ashamed, and less “macho” and are uncomfortable discussing infertility, even with their doctors, hampering communication and referrals. Outsiders, including patients, parents, siblings, extended family, and friends, may fail to appreciate these travails and ask or push prospective parents about having children, unaware of these impediments.

      "title": "Cohort Profile: The 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort",
      "abstract": "There is ample evidence showing how marginalization and inequalities in well-being and health have roots in childhood. Preand perinatal factors affect childhood and adolescent outcomes—such as mortality and morbidity, behavioural problems, delinquent and criminal behaviour, cognitive and motor functioning and teenage pregnancies, but the extent to which these effects are sustained through adulthood is less clear. Epidemiological research has identified various early childhood determinants for social exclusion in adolescence and adulthood. These include preand perinatal, genetic as well as environmental risk factors across childhood years. Problems also run in families as a result of both social and biological processes. There is information about several risk factors that contribute to adolescent mental health problems. However, little is known about the protective factors. The Finnish welfare system provides many services to children in at-risk groups, yet little is known about the long-term effects of different official actions and at times reports have been unfavourable. In addition, significant health differences have been observed according to gender and region, but the reasons for these remain unknown. Most data on child and adolescent health and social coping are sample based, cross-sectional or based on short-term outcome. The increased routine collection of administrative register data has created new possibilities for life-course epidemiological research. Previously, such data have not been widely used for follow-up purposes. The Academy of Finland launched a research programme on Responding to Public Health Challenges (SALVE) in 2008. This programme is set to provide applicable information in order to respond to current and future key public health issues, and to bring together approaches applied in public health research as well as in behavioural sciences, social sciences and biosciences. The programme is divided into four thematic areas: health-protecting and health-promoting factors, life-course approaches and critical periods of life, health inequalities and clustering of ill health, and predicting future health. Follow-up of the 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort is funded by the consortium ‘Life-course Determinants of Mental Health, Marginalization and Social Coping’ through the Academy of Finland’s SALVE research programme.",

      "abstract": "Events occur in Ukraine that go beyond the limits of everyday life and stability and bring lives to people, affecting the everyday meaning of human existence and giving it a certain boundary-existential context. Therefore, the existence of an individual in the midst of instability and unpredictability will raise the problem of helping victims of traumatic events throughout the country. If do not receive timely and proper professional social and psychological assistance, in victims, increases the level of trauma that could greatly complicate further their physical, psychological and social recovery. This begs the important task of developing effective programs to prevent and overcome the psychoemotional trauma of the personality. Working out quantitative results of research and their qualitative analysis concerning the primary indicators of our places of stay in psychoemotional traumatization, concerning the loss or destruction of physical or social danger, or psychological and social danger of an individual. Emotional psychotrauma can occur not only because of the impact of such critical cases as war or natural and social cataclysms, serious illnesses, but also due to the breakdown of relations, deep frustration in people or life, loss of an ideal, social or individual deprivation of personality. In general, the results indicate the main reasons and consequences of obtaining a psychotrauma by the subjects; determine the ways of self-correction that respondents use, as well as the lack of their focus on seeking help from professional psychologists. Also updated the question of the availability and professional support such aid and create conditions for broader prevention work with different groups of people.",

      "abstract": "Psychologists have the unique expertise of accumulated knowledge concerning incentive manipulation of behavior that they can bring to the research issue of incentives and fertility control. Equal or greater resources need to be invested in other approaches to the question of how to control fertility in addition to the usual solution of family planning. Any programs seeking to control fertility without the use of coercive or repressive means must be concerned with environmental aspects that influence the number of children a family has. It becomes necessary to identify the total range of contingencies in the environment of a given population that influence family size and then alter those contingencies in order to increase birth limitation behavior and decrease average family size. The issue of public sensitivity regarding family size ethical responsibility and efficiency of programs designed to control fertility all affect any research approach to the problem of fertility control. A practical approach to a research study of fertility control is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Incentives can be positive or aversive relative to birth limitation and birth facilitation. They are anticipated or observed consequences of a behavior that tend to either increase or decrease the frequency of occurrence of that behavior. A conceptual framework is needed to guarantee that no major incentives are disregarded in the research. Lipe and Jung have developed such a framework. It divides the types of incentives into stimulus and response incentives. The stimulus incentives include material social secondary and vicarious incentives; feedback of consequences; and aversive incentives. Response incentives can be any of the existing high probability activities of the target couples themselves. The target population would include all adults of a community who are in their fertile years with the focus on the group for whom birth limitation is most relevant. Mode of incentive delivery and timing of reinforcements along with the nondelivery of certain incentives are all part of the framework.",

      "title": "Reconceptualising Female Disordered Eating and Body-Image Perceptions: A Gynocentric Trajectory Through the New-media",
      "abstract": "Depriving the body from eating and developing a phobia about food is a vital attribute of the neurotic ailment, Anorexia Nervosa. Conspicuously, this is labeled as a female disorder. Various studies have examined that the germination point of this disorder is substantially based on the social presumptions such as, “Thin is beautiful.” In the psychoanalytical sense, this can be a response to ‘lack’ or ‘deficiency’ communicated through Lacanian Symbolic Order. This ‘lack’ unconsciously drives the female to look or become ‘thin.’ As proven in the various studies, this disciplinary project is marked by unattainability. Hence, this desire only ensues in female dejection and shame; further, it also restores her ‘deficiency.’ Nevertheless, in the last decade, new-media tools may have transformed the dynamics of female bodily-presumptions and their disordered eating. Various body-positive new-media handles seem to have deposed the Lacanian ‘lack’ and the ‘Symbolic Order’ only to replace them with an unrestrained and real female language. In this lieu, the paper theoretically critiques the Lacanian notions of female ‘Lack’ in the new-media domain. This study attempts to reconceptualise the trajectory of disordered eating and the female body-images from the twentieth century through the twenty-first century (i.e., with the augmentation of new-media).",

To examine how accurate individuals are in estimating how old they look and how old others are, younger, middle-aged, and older adults rated photographs of older target persons (for whom we had information about objective and subjective age) in terms of age and other characteristics. Whereas the older targets had quite accurate perceptions of how old they look, the raters’ age estimations for those targets were rather inaccurate. Older raters and those with frequent contact with older adults provided the most accurate age estimations. Targets that were rated more favorably with respect to attractiveness or fitness were perceived as younger than those with negative ratings.",

      "title": "Cultural and Ethnic Differences in Eating Disorders and Disordered Eating Behaviors",
      "abstract": "The early literature on eating disorders focused primarily on young, White women in the United States and Europe. However, there is alarming recent evidence showing that there are increasing rates of eating disorders both in the United States among non-European American ethnic groups and across the globe in previously non- Westernized countries. Some researchers attribute these increased prevalence rates to the growing role of Westernization across the world. It has also been suggested that eating disorders, specifically bulimia nervosa, may be culture-bound syndromes. Indeed, one of the primary theories behind the development of eating disorders is the socio-cultural model of eating disorders, which posits that eating disorders develop from a mixture of social and cultural risk factors. The current review focuses on the cultural and ethnic differences and similarities of eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors among (a) diverse ethnic groups in the United States (African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American) and (b) women in several Asian countries (Japan, China, India, and Pakistan). Specifically, we focus on cultural differences in excessive dieting, restriction, fears of fatness, body dissatisfaction, purging, and bingeing, which are core behavioral expressions of disordered eating that are common across the eating disorders. We pay special attention to socio-cultural factors and values present in each of these ethnic and cultural groups, which may influence the expression of these behaviors. Finally, we end by discussing the clinical implications that stem from the differences and similarities in these behaviors across groups and cultures.

      "abstract": "Behaviour can be influenced by genes, environment, and developmental history, but quantifying these effects in humans and over our evolutionary past is challenging. Here we use a mathematical model that mechanistically recovers major aspects of human development and evolution to compute the causal effects on adult energy extraction skill (e.g., at food acquisition or processing) of point interventions earlier in development. We find that, in this model, adult skill is little reactive to genetic change due to trade-offs in energy allocation to tissue growth, and that this reactivity has decreased over evolution. Adult skill is more reactive to environmental changes and least reactive to social change, and these reactivities have increased over evolution. Adult skill is much more reactive to changes in developmental history, defined as developmentally earlier phenotypes, than to genetic, environmental, or social change, although this reactivity has decreased over evolution. For instance, the model predicts that developmental changes that increase either an individual's body size as an infant or their skill level as a child boost adult skill in the same individual proportionally much more than enhancing this individual's environment as an infant or as a child. Our analyses suggest that developmental history can be a major influence on human skill acting separately from genetic, environmental, and social factors.",

Abuse of children is defined on different manners in literature but the author gives essential elements for legal determination of this concept. Act of violence exists when a parent, using a physical power on a position of supremacy tyrannies a child endangering its life, health, physical or emotional development. Physical abuse of a child can be determined from several aspects: medical, legal, social and cultural. The phenomenon of abuse was first observed by medical doctor and described as 'the battered child syndrome'. Although, it seams easy to define the physical abuse, there are many various definitions. In this paper, physical abuse of a child in the family means physical acting of the parents or guardians, by which on purpose, by the use of physical force, with or without the use of other means, are caused or could be caused physical injuries or death of a child. Emotional abuse is defined as parent's or guardian's acting or non acting, such as rejection, insult, isolation, terror, verbal attack etc. that might cause serious and permanent disorders in child's emotional development. Sexual abuse is defined as the use of a child to satisfy the sexual needs of one or more adult persons who have authority over a child and in whom the child trusts. The sexual abuse survivors have lifelong psychological problems.",

      "abstract": "Population momentum is generally defined in terms of fertility, as the tendency for population growth to continue beyond the time that replacement level fertility has been achieved because of a high concentration of women in the childbearing years. However, population momentum can be defined more generally as the influence that a population's age structure has on its rate of natural increase. Changes in the age structure affect both birth and death rates. The birth rate is influenced by the relative number of women of reproductive age and by the rate at which they give birth. The maturing of the age structure acts to slow down the decline in the birth rate. The extent of further declines in the rate of natural increase depends on the extent to which the crude death rate increases and/or the crude birth rate decreases. Age structure variations can have a substantial effect on the crude death rate, which can reach a very low level in populations with relatively few elderly people. Yet, as the percentage of elderly increases due to longterm declines in fertility, crude death rates in these countries rise. If the birth rate continues to fall as the death rate rises, the rate of natural increase may soon reach zero or turn negative. In summary, population momentum tends at 1st to slow down declines in rates of natural increase. Eventually, however, continued aging of the population accelerates declines in rates of natural increase and population growth.",

Holistic care for persons with disabilities means the rehabilitation nurse intervenes when problems of sexual function are discovered, observed, or expressed. However, most people with chronic illnesses and disabilities must confront prevalent myths about their sexual nature and abilities. These myths often have their basis in the notion, common in our society, that the only people who are sexual are those who are young and beautiful. People who are obese, old, or do not conform to current standards of sexual attractiveness are usually deemed as asexual or undesirable. These narrow sterotypes have been particularly damaging to physically or mentally disabled people. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities often have special needs regarding their sexual behavior. Most of us will confront chronic illness or disability in our own lives to some degree. In addition, illnss or disability can occur at any age. In this study, I discuss some of the special needs of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities and the methods of coping with those needs.

The influence of pubertal development on behavior is usually examined in terms of either pubertal status or pubertal timing.

      "abstract": "Some important psychosocial factors which lead to unwanted pregnancies -- fear, embarrassment, conflicting priorities, and subconscious motivation -- are reviewed along with the need for nurses to be aware of their own attitudes about contraception and sexuality when counseling clients about contraception. Individuals may hesitate to use effective contraceptive methods because of reported side effects or because they fear the judgmental attitudes of others. Embarrassment about discussing anything related to sexuality or having a medical examination can mean a woman will avoid certain contraceptive methods. Frequently, contraceptive use is subordinated to some other concern, reflecting a lack of maturity, an inability to focus objectively or to plan, to assume responsibility, to accept one's own behavior. Priorities commonly affecting contraceptive use include: the \"nice girls don't\" ideology; \"it won't happen to me;\" \"excitement is taking risks;\" loneliness; and crises and pressures. Although pregnancy may be rejected when it actually happens, it may be desired in part. The desire for pregnancy may be operating at a subconscious level. Additionally, pregnancy may be used to deal with or avoid conflicts in relationships, to ease guilt, or to make up for losses. Nurses counseling clients in family planning clinics can help their clients do a cost/benefit analysis of contraceptive use and pregnancy should it occur. A way to help women explore their available options is group sessions. Nurses should be aware of the goals of family planning work and help each client explore for herself the ramifications of the use of each of the available contraceptive methods.",

The shape of an answer has now emerged. Dieting is one discipline imposed upon a body subject to the \"tyranny of slenderness\"; exercise is another. Since men as well as women exercise, it is not always easy in the case of women to distinguish what is done for the sake of physical fitness from what is done in obedience to the requirements of femininity. There are significant gender differences in gesture, posture, movement, and general bodily comportment: Women are far more restricted than men in their manner of movement and in their lived spatiality.",

Besides the role of the social context, it is also assumed that familiar factors, both common family environment and genetic inheritance, have an important influence on food intake and eating behavior linked with childhood obesity. Research on food intake and childhood obesity has been traditionally focused on the amount and type of foods in the usual diet. However, it is an increasing interest to understand the link between eating behavior and obesity using questionnaires. There are several psychometric tools that have been developed specifically to deal with human eating behavior. This review summarizes the family influences, both genetic and non-genetic, on childhood feeding behavior and their relation to childhood obesity.",

      "title": "Teenagers who plan parenthood",
      "abstract": "It is clear that a variable number of teenage mothers have, to some extent, planned parenthood. From an evolutionary perspective, it could be argued that teenage childbearing may in fact be a positive adaptive mechanism for humans raised in a hostile environment. Life history theory suggests that in risky and uncertain environments the optimal reproductive strategy is to reproduce early in order to maximise the probability of leaving any descendents at all. If some teenagers are planning or hoping for pregnancy, it is possible that some positive behavioural changes may be observed. This has proven to be the case with many teenagers altering their risk taking behaviours in the anticipation and expectation of pregnancy. There is now substantial evidence that teenagers who become pregnant were at higher risk than the general population for using cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. However, once pregnant, rates of consumption are usually lower compared with their non-pregnant peers or even their own personal pre-pregnancy rates of consumption. Therefore, for some teenagers, the conscious or unconscious prospect of pregnancy represents a potential space in which to rethink behaviours that may be harmful to themselves as a future mother, and also to their child. Given that teenage motherhood is not going to simply vanish, it is important to remember to focus research and services on validated interventions that may assist teenage mothers fulfill their ambitions of parenthood and simultaneously provide the best outcomes for their offspring. Evidence-based interventions focus on sustained home visitation by nurses, with limited evidence supporting the use of volunteers. In contrast, evidence suggests that home visitation by paraprofessionals may not be effective. Other strategies that may be helpful include the use of multidisciplinary teenage pregnancy clinics that have been noted to be associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. The role of new mothers’ groups, other community based group activities, peer support workers and intensive educational interventions to encourage return to schooling may be useful but have not been subjected to randomised evaluation. Such evaluation needs to occur.",

      "abstract": "A series of reports from studies have found that neurological, physical, and mental characteristics of the infant during the first year of life have little relation to later behavior. The Rochester Developmental Psychopathology Study was designed to translate sociological variables into psychological variables. When populations with specific perinatal complications have been studied longitudinally abnormalities have been found, but these tended to disappear with age. When infants born prematurely were followed through school age, the deficits in their intelligence at earlier ages were greatly reduced in later years. The major impact of biological defects associated with reproductive casualty appears to occur in the first weeks of pregnancy when spontaneous abortions produce many fetal losses. When change and transformation are seen to be the rules of development rather than the exceptions, then a new perspective can be given to developmental prediction.",

Individuals engage in physical activity during leisure-time and also during in many other activities such as walking to work, home maintenance, shopping and child care. Physical activity also occurs on the job is this is referred to as work physical activity. Prior studies have shown that non-work physical activity has a positive impact on health while work physical activity has a negative impact on health. Many prior studies have relied primarily on leisure-time physical activity, which typically constitutes only about 10% of non-work physical activity and does not capture specific information on the intensity or duration of the activity. This study addresses these limitations by constructing measures of physical activity from the American Time Use Surveys, which are all-inclusive and capture the duration of each activity combined with its intensity based on the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET). Non-work physical activity tends to be significantly lower for Blacks, Hispanics, other racial groups than for Whites and lower for males than for females. These adjusted differentials are consistent with racial, ethnic and gender differentials in health. About 25-46% of the differentials in non-work physical activity can be attributed to differences in education, socio-economic status, proxies for time constraints, and locational attributes.",

      "abstract": "A man's physical fitness largely depends on the ability to maintain body balance. This ability is examined by using various methods and tests, still searching for the best way of its evaluation. Body balance is discussed from different aspects and in relation to various developmental periods. Usually, static and dynamic balance are distinguished. Commonly used computer techniques and different kinds of tests of balance evaluation are still not satisfactory and they constitute a topic for discussion over the value of these measurements. Balance system of the body require the interaction of many mechanisms, which undoubtedly, impedes the construction of the measuring device used for its accurate and reliable assessment, both in static and dynamic conditions. The conducted research on linking body balance with other manifestations of a man's motor skills, for example the impact of body composition and gender on the level of this feature, is very helpful in the accurate assessment of this feature among the youth and children. The differences, resulting from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors, in somatic potential that are manifested in different body size and body proportions, may be decisive of a children’s motor skills and predispositions. It has been proved that the influence of specific exercises can effectively influence the level of children's balance. The purpose of the report is to review different methods of body balance examination. The PubMed and Scopus databases have been searched. The following keywords were used in the search: balance, postural balance, coordination, coordination diagnostics.

      "abstract": "Many different personality types were represented in this study as has been described by various observers. The major factor motivating the sexual behaviour of these women was the overwhelming importance to them of maintaining the dependent relationship upon a male with a total and blind acquiescence to his wishes. Of lesser importance were acting out against parents, a strong sexual drive, the need to prove oneself a woman and a desire, conscious or unconscious, to have a baby. Much guilt was aroused by the use of or insistence on birth control measures; these implied responsibility for sexual activity, the use of such measures was precluded. Contrary to other reports, nausea, vomiting and obstetrical complications occurred with the same frequency as in married women. The course of the pregnancy did not appear to be affected in any way. It was concluded that a weak ego structure was more basic to their behaviour than the unconscious drive to have a baby, or the acting out of unconscious fantasies which often have been assumed in the previous literature. The results suggest that the mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is of physiological rather than psychological origin, and that the course of pregnancy is not as readily affected by unhealthy motivation for having the baby as has often been assumed.",

There are several factors that can contribute to infertility in women and men however about 1 in 5 cases of infertility are identified as unexplained. There’s a time frame to fertility in human life span; child bearing age is defined in females but not in males in general. Infertility has significant negative social impacts particularly on women. Infertility is regarded as a negative force in population dynamics because there is no biological replacement, and the continuation of human society. Infertile couples might experience social and psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, social isolation, and sexual dysfunction. Infertile couples suffer from an impaired health-related quality of life. Women in particular are at greater risk of violence, divorce, social stigma, emotional stress, depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. In women, cause of infertility can include endometriosis, uterine fibroids and thyroid disease. Men with fertility problems may have a low sperm count or low testosterone. The risk of infertility increases with age.",

      "title": "Topical Review: Fetal Testosterone and Sex Differences in Typical Social Development and in Autism",
      "abstract": "Experiments in animals leave no doubt that androgens, including testosterone, produced by the testes in fetal and/or neonatal life act on the brain to induce sex differences in neural structure and function. In human beings, there is evidence supporting a female superiority in the ability to read nonverbal signals, specific language-related skills, and theory of mind. Even more striking than the sex differences seen in the typical population is the elevated occurrence of social and communicative difficulties in human males. One such condition, autism, occurs four times more frequently in boys than in girls. Recently, a novel theory known as the ``extreme male brain'' has been proposed. It suggests that the behaviors seen in autism are an exaggeration of typical sex differences and that exposure to high levels of prenatal testosterone might be a risk factor. In this article, we argue that prenatal and neonatal testosterone exposures are strong candidates for having a causal role in sexual dimorphism in human behavior, including social development, and as risk factors for conditions characterized by social impairments, particularly autism spectrum conditions.

      "abstract": "When one thrives, they grow, develop and succeed. For people of diverse sexual orientations (DSO) thriving within one's sexuality is often restricted by heteronormativity, minority stress and poor mental health outcomes. Particularly at risk, are DSO \"emerging adults\" aged between 18–29 years who seek stability before transitioning to adulthood. Therefore, this qualitative study interviewed 12 participants between the ages of 18–29 years to investigate perceptions of thriving within one's sexuality and factors that may foster or hinder its occurrence. The results indicated participants perceived thriving as a spectrum of states and processes involving a sense of personal safety with high levels of self-acceptance to believe one could exist freely as a person of DSO. The findings suggested thriving within one's sexuality during emerging adulthood is fostered through the factors of seeking personal growth, social representation/visibility, affirming social support and opportunities to support other DSO people. In contrast, identity denial, unsupportive social environments, erasure/tokenism, and experiences of discrimination eroded one's ability to thrive. Psychological interventions focusing on establishing a strong sense of identity, building a social support network and encouragement to seek thriving opportunities, may foster thriving experiences for Australian DSO emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "Problem behavior may be defined as behavior that is socially defined as a problem, a source of concern, or as undesirable by the norms of conventional society and the institutions of adult authority, and its occurrence usually elicits some kind of social control response. Key elements of problem behavior are: (1) problem behaviors are rare until early adolescence; (2) the rate then climbs to a peak level; (3) thereafter the problem behavior becomes less frequent for the remainder of the lifespan (unless it ceases to be seen as a problem behavior), and (4) the timing of these trends is different for different problem behaviors in respects such as the typical age of initiation and the rate and timing of decline. Problem behavior varies with age because of social norms that children be given increasing independelice as they grow older. At each age, tl'ose adolescents who are less closely supervised are more likely to engage in problem behavior. Also relevant to this point is research that time spent socializing with peers in informal settings, away from adult supervision, is related to problem behavior. The question that remains is whether the relationship between independence and problem behavior, combined with the similarity in their age trends, is sufficient to account for age trends in problem behavior.

      "title": "Directions of Change in Japanese Religiosity",
      "abstract": "Assertions about ‘secularisation’ in Japan are dependent on the accuracy of attempts to measure religiosity. Most indices try to measure observable religious practices , some also trying to assess levels of belief , but very few studies have attempted to measure the prevalence of religious experience . Measurements in each of these dimensions is problematic to some extent, so it is very difficult to know whether or not Japanese religiosity overall is increasing, declining or staying about the same, albeit with some surface changes. It is probably premature to assert too confidently that there is secularisation in Japan, or that religion is increasing or staying the same. This paper reviews some of the different dimensions of religiosity that need to be considered when trying to measure changes in religious behaviour. Statistics on alleged beliefs or observable practices need to be understood from the perspective of the motivations and attitudes behind them. In many cases, they are best understood in the perspective of the life-cycle, whereby expressions of religiosity change at different stages in a person’s life and are influenced by a variety of personal factors that affect whether or not an individual might participate in certain forms of religious practices.",

A unique task for the elderly is the acceptance of the finitude of life and the inevitability, even proximity, of death. Second, none of the preceding stages is resolved completely in one direction or the other; every adult has some elements of mistrust, some degree of shame and doubt. One of the most consistent findings in investigations of adult development is that personality traits remain stable across the lifespan. Cognitive changes that occur with normal aging are significant. Many of the declines in cognitive function seem to be less dramatic in individuals of higher educational achievement. Physical changes in the reproductive system are numerous and significant, but their effects on sexual function and satisfaction are much less profound than is popularly imagined.",

Hence, it is important to understand how and when individual differences in multiple domains of self‐concept begin to stabilize and whether individual differences remain stable throughout childhood and adolescence and into early adulthood. Methods We assessed individuals’ ( N = 372) scholastic, social, athletic, and physical appearance self‐concepts at five waves over 20 years from age 4 to age 24. Results In general, stability was large, but medium‐sized estimates were obtained for some domains over longer (e.g., 6‐year) intervals. Indirect effects from preschool to early adulthood were small, but from age 14 to 24 were medium to large. Stabilities maintained significance independent of family socioeconomic status and global self‐worth. Stability estimates were similar for boys and girls except over adolescence for scholastic self‐concept, which was more stable for girls than boys. Conclusions Multiple domains of self‐concept constitute stable individual‐difference characteristics, independent of global feelings of self‐worth. Individuals who have high or low self‐concepts early in development tend to maintain their relative standing into early adulthood suggesting points of intervention.",

      "abstract": "It is verified if really the child support Money is used exclusively in the\r\nbeneficiary, so it has to regulate this situation in the Organic Code of\r\nChilhood and adolescence.\r\nIt provides some conclusions, recommendations and gives an alternative of\r\nsolution that is the legal proposal of reform.\r\nBut the big problem facing the child, adolescent, or any other beneficiary of\r\nthe Right to Food, which is not proven in a real way to receive food and other\r\nsupport required by the holder to the right, is leaving calamity in the field of\r\nhealth, in the legal field and in the social area, with regard to health the lack\r\nof nutrients in the human body carries physiological alterations such as delay\r\nin physical, psychological and intellectual development, to subsequently pass\r\nto a very sad field of diseases such as anemia, caused by a bad and almost\r\nnonexistent nourishment, now in the legal area this problem has even more\r\nconnotation due to unless is proved that in fact the alimony money is used in\r\nfood for child, is being promoted legal uncertainty for a subject of rights such\r\nas the child or adolescent and since if this money is given, is to do just that to\r\ndeliver food and other child support, that is the main purpose of the special\r\nlegislation of childhood and adolescence in the area of Right to Food,\r\ntherefore is assembled a whole super state structure like the courts that try to\r\nprovide justice in the range of childhood and adolescence, specialized police\r\nfor childhood and adolescence, the constitutional mandate of imprisonment\r\nfor debt of alimonies, building a amounts table of alimonies made by the\r\nNational Council for Childhood and Adolescence, all that is going to the\r\nground because there is not a real verification that are received food and\r\nother support required by the holder to the right of the Organic Code of\r\nChildhood and Adolescence which causes the misuse of Right to Food.\r\nSecond, sponsoring the principles of children rights, such as the Right to\r\nFood principle, is not being respected at all even, is made a table of the\r\nnutrition right that children have, for this unfortunate situation that is giving in\r\nsubstantive right of Ecuador in childhood and adolescence area, which\r\nmotivated me to carry out this study, in order to provide complete protection\r\nto the Right to Food of children, is very important to change this harmful\r\nsituation in the Organic Code of Childhood and Adolescence, since the Right\r\nto Food is a basic human right for the prolongation and development of life,\r\nto carry out the Right to Food for the child is necessary and analyzing this\r\nproblem of the not checking the destination of the alimony money, extends a\r\nlittle more the effects of these problems and above all gives a hint of solution,\r\nwith the only purpose of this Right to Food materializes for children,\r\nadolescents, and any other beneficiary to one hundred percent.\r\nNow in the social area, I see that is being fulfilled this popular adage that\r\nstates it is so easy like taking candy from a baby (emphasis are mine)\r\nthey are doing just that, they are taking the most defenseless beings of the\r\nworld society their food, health, hope, happiness. It produces frightening to\r\nthink that there are people who wasted alimony money on issues completely\r\nunrelated to the child's interest, but there those people and they are enough,\r\nthose are entrusted by possession or custody of the children, adolescent or\r\nany other beneficiary who does not manage properly his money for alimony;\r\nsociety is attentive, apparently it is passive, but constantly working on the\r\nmost vulnerable of the social body, as when the Lions Club of Loja, delivers\r\neducational equipment for children of our community is evidence that society\r\nis aware of our children, and those bad managers of money they receive for\r\nalimony are morally sanctioned like irresponsible, unscrupulous to other\r\npositive entities of social body, lacking only a legal sanction be imposed.",

This is an ominous sign because scientific research documents that inequality is a driving force behind many of our most profound social ills. The Equality Trust reviewed thousands of studies conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and the World Bank. Consistent patterns emerged, both between and within countries. Inequality is associated with diminished levels of physical and mental health, child well-being, educational achievement, social mobility, trust, and community life. And it is linked to increased levels of violence, drug use, imprisonment, obesity, and teenage births.

Just prior to puberty, the sensitivity of the gonadostat to the negative feedback of gonadal sex steroids decreases, releasing the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) from inhibition. Puberty is heralded by the myriad of physical changes that occur in the body with the advent of the hormonally mediated effects and the cognitive shift associated with them. With both the psychological and biological maturity of adolescence come issues of separation and individuation, consolidation of a sense of self, development of a sexual identity and progress toward academic and vocational plans for adult life. The most useful framework for the discussion is the biopsychosocial model, which has also been used successfully in so many other domains. Throughout adolescence, the work of development that was made possible by the physical, cognitive and psychological changes induced by puberty continues unabated.",

      "abstract": "The attachment of the infant to the mother can be seen in open parkland when an infant is set free for exercise and play. In an area of safe space, a mother has little cause to restrain her child, nor, owing to other attractions around, to entertain or otherwise divert him. In order to deduce which of the women and infants make up kinship pairs, the observer postulates criteria for recognizing a pair; attachment is then conceived of as factors which identify a mother and her infant in field conditions. The infant detaches himself from his mother but he maintains proximity to her, particularly around the age of 2 years, when his proximity- and contact-seeking are at their height. Yet, at this age, the infant shows most alertness to remote events. From 2 years old onwards, the presence of age-mates competes for the infant's proximity. Hence, the statistical data presented below is from observations which were made when the likelihood of interruption by neighbouring people was minimal. Proximity to the mother can be defined as the child's being at rest beside her, or as his playing in her vicinity, or as a pattern of exploratory locomotion with the mother the centre of the territory he covers. In each of these aspects, the behaviour of 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds is distinguished by typical distances from the mother. The infant's responsiveness to unexpected sights or sounds is inferred from the orientation responses he makes to them. In his postures and the distances he takes up from the mother, his feeling-states of alertness, fear, anger, uncertainty, fatigue and conflict are expressed; when thus activated, he tends to relate himself to his mother.",

Clinically, practitioners are concerned with whether the difficulty lies in conception or carrying a pregnancy to term; however, in social science research the underlying focus is on the parents' inability to have a child more broadly. Age is a predominant factor in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, such that individuals who are aged 35 years or older are often labeled and treated as infertile within six months, rather than one year, of unprotected intercourse resulting in no pregnancy. Individuals can be characterized as having primary infertility, which is when they have no prior children, or secondary infertility, suggesting they have successfully birthed a child prior to their current attempt to become pregnant. Approximately 15 percent of couples, or 4.3 of the 28 million married couples in the United States, encounter difficulty conceiving at some point in their relational life span.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a resurgence in the interest in family size intentions and ideals in developed societies, partially stemming from the idea that realized fertility in these societies is lower than intended fertility. This paper addresses the question of the stability of family size intentions. Based on Heckhausen's life-span theory of control, it is hypothesized that young adults' family size intentions are likely to change as a result of their experiences in the family and occupational life domains. To study this issue, data are used from a Dutch panel survey in which respondents are questioned on their family size intentions six times over the course of 18 years. The results show that family size intentions are not stable, but are adjusted as people age. On average, the adjustment is downward, but some people do not adjust their intentions or even adjust them upwards. Much of this difference in age patterns can be explained by changes in the partner, educational, and occupational careers of young adults. Not finding a suitable partner and pursuing a career-for women-are important factors. But also the timing of the fertility career itself is of major importance. If respondents postpone having children until their thirties, they are much more likely to adjust their intentions downwards than if they start their childbearing career earlier.",

      "title": "Out of “Objectification Limelight”? The Contribution of Body Appreciation to Sexual Adjustment in Midlife Women",
      "abstract": "According to objectification theory, women become culturally desexualized during midlife and have the opportunity to let go of their propensity to self-objectify. In young women, self-objectification is negatively related to sexual adjustment. Yet little is known about what could ameliorate this relationship or whether it continues after midlife. Body appreciation (i.e., acceptance and positive regard for the body) has been substantiated as a contributor to improved sexual adjustment in young and older women alike. Hence, this study was designed to examine whether it helps mitigate the deleterious effect of self-objectification on sexual function, satisfaction, and distress in women over the age of 50 (n = 193). Path analyses revealed that self-surveillance is related to body shame and appearance anxiety, the latter of which was related to body self-consciousness during sex. In turn, body self-consciousness during sex mediated the relationship between body shame, appearance anxiety, and all three indicators of sexual adjustment. Furthermore, high body appreciation attenuated the negative associations between self-objectification constructs, body self-consciousness during sex, and sexual satisfaction and distress. Overall, this study supports the use of objectification theory in midlife and older women. Sex therapy interventions that incorporate mindfulness and body appreciation principles are discussed.",

      "title": "Why reduce health inequalities?",
      "abstract": "It is well known that social, cultural and economic factors cause substantial inequalities in health. Should we strive to achieve a more even share of good health, beyond improving the average health status of the population? We examine four arguments for the reduction of health inequalities.1 Inequalities are unfair. Inequalities in health are undesirable to the extent that they are unfair, or unjust. Distinguishing between health inequalities and health inequities can be contentious. Our view is that inequalities become \"unfair\" when poor health is itself the consequence of an unjust distribution of the underlying social determinants of health (for example, unequal opportunities in education or employment).2 Inequalities affect everyone. Conditions that lead to marked health disparities are detrimental to all members of society. Some types of health inequalities have obvious spillover effects on the rest of society, for example, the spread of infectious diseases, the consequences of alcohol and drug misuse, or the occurrence of violence and crime.3 Inequalities are avoidable. Disparities in health are avoidable to the extent that they stem from identifiable policy options exercised by governments, such as tax policy, regulation of business and labour, welfare benefits and health care funding. It follows that health inequalities are, in principle, amenable to policy interventions. A government that cares about improving the health of the population ought therefore to incorporate considerations of the health impact of alternative options in its policy setting process.3 Interventions to reduce health inequalities are cost effective. Public health programmes that reduce health inequalities can also be cost effective. The case can be made to give priority to such programmes (for example, improving access to cervical cancer screening in low income women) on efficiency grounds. On the other hand, few programmes designed to reduce health inequalities have been formally evaluated using cost effectiveness analysis. We conclude that fairness is likely to be the most influential argument in favour of acting to reduce disparities in health, but the concept of equity is contested and susceptible to different interpretations. There is persuasive evidence for some outcomes that reducing inequalities will diminish \"spill over\" effects on the health of society at large. In principle, you would expect that differences in health status that are not biologically determined are avoidable. However, the mechanisms giving rise to inequalities are still imperfectly understood, and evidence remains to be gathered on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce such inequalities.",

We may also adapt our food choices and eating behavior to create a certain impression or to fit in with a particular social group. What we eat depends largely on our desire to conform to social norms and our own or others' stereotypical expectations, which are often an expression of our social identity, that is, the perception of belonging to a group or community. We learn norms and stereotypes by modelling and unconsciously imitating the eating behavior of those around us. Our food choices may also be in line with our personal values, such as health, environmental sustainability, or animal welfare, which are also shaped by our social identity.",

Although many researchers have examined the demographic characteristics of individuals who are the most likely to be persistently poor, the emphasis has been on race, sex, and education. Little attention has been paid to the role that disability might play in long-term poverty. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to utilize longitudinal Add Health data in order to explore whether or not the presence of a disability might also affect an individual’s likelihood of experiencing financial hardship. We find that in addition to race, gender, and education, individuals with a disability are at greater risk of being poor than their counterparts without disabilities. Overall, having a mental health, physical, or learning disability in childhood or adolescence was associated with straitened socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "The analyses reported here draw on recent work on gender and deviance to derive hypotheses concerning sex differences in drinking behavior, reactions of significant others to male and female intoxication, and the psychological consequences of drinking experiences. The hypotheses are evaluated in structural equation models with recent national data on drinking behavior and consequences. Consistent with the gendered deviance perspective, the results suggest that sex differences in style as well as frequency of intoxication mitigate the adverse consequences of female drinking commonly presumed on the basis of biological vulnerability or societal disapproval of female drunkenness. Compared to males, females become intoxicated less frequently and are less likely to abandon personal control while drinking (as indicated by aggression, blackouts, and rapid ingestion). As expected, these sex differences in drinking behavior are smaller among adolescents than among adults. Partly as a result of this different drinking style, significant others are no more likely to criticize girls or women for their drinking than they are to criticize boys or men. Two hypotheses concerning the greater psychological vulnerability of females to depression as a result of drinking or criticism of drinking by significant others are supported among youths but not among adults.",

But this conception has shown its limits in the complexity of children's social worlds. Today, dominance is rather conceived in terms of asymmetry in resource control within children's dyads. Some observational studies have been done in this context, but only on small groups of familiar children and often up to 3 years of age. Our aim was to reveal whether asymmetry in resource control would occur between younger children who met each other for the first time in the presence of an attractive toy. We observed 201 dyads of 19‐month‐old unfamiliar peers in four repetitive competitive sessions for a toy. Resource control and asymmetry between participants were highly consistent between sessions. The level of asymmetry in resource control between participants was very high. This asymmetry was influenced neither by gender nor by age, and coercive behaviors in the situation, physical aggression rated by parents, birth order, and day‐care habits did not account for the asymmetry in our setting. However, body size at birth (although not at the time of testing) and anxiety rated by parents contributed significantly to the asymmetry in resource control.",

      "title": "Public Health and the Second 50 Years of Life",
      "abstract": "Aging is the maturation and senescence of biological systems. With each additional decade of life, adults will see a number of changes, for example, a slowing in reaction time, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory; declines in strength and walking speed; a decreased rate of urine flow; loss of skeletal muscle; and, of course, greater mortality. They will also see declines in addictive behaviors and crime; a reduction in severe psychiatric disorders; stability in psychological well-being; continuing increases in vocabulary; greater selectivity in friendship and increased contact with close family; less need for novel stimuli; and increases in wealth, leisure time, and altruistic behaviors, among many other changes. The popular understanding of aging mostly stresses negative changes that result in disability, but a more complete understanding should stress both kinds of change, for both are relevant to a public health perspective on aging.\r\n\r\nThese changes may be more prevalent in older people because they are, in fact, true expressions of senescence. Or they may be more prevalent simply because of the greater length of time older people have lived, and hence the greater opportunity they have had to experience the risks or exposures that produce these effects. This is a key distinction. More than likely, some combination of true senescence and greater exposure to risk factors is likely to be responsible for the changes we consider “aging.” For example, the highest audible pitch people can hear declines with age, suggesting that this change is a senescent feature of the auditory system. But it is also likely that long years of occupational exposure to noise, untreated ear infections during childhood, neurological conditions, and an accumulation of minor injuries might contribute to loss of hearing in old age. What happens in the first half of life must surely matter to health in the second half.",

It has also been shown that the longer immigrants have been in Western societies, the less obese they tend to be. This study examined how Kenyan Asian, British and Kenyan British females from similar backgrounds perceived female body shapes. As predicted, the Kenyans rated larger figures more favourably and smaller figures less favourably than the British. Also, as predicted, it was found that the Kenyan Asian British were more similar to the British group in their perceptions. The results support the view that social and cultural factors play dominant role in the perception of one's own and others' body shapes. In addition, the results reveal that in Britain preferences for small body shapes to the point of being anorexic are not uncommon.",

      "title": "Predicting and preventing youth violence: understanding and disrupting developmental trajectories and risk",
      "abstract": "The relationship between age and crime is well known and has been documented throughout history. Although different types of offenses tend to peak at different ages, violent and delinquent behaviour typically increase during adolescence and the early years of adulthood, and taper off with advancing age. There also appears to be little specialisation in the types of offenses committed by young people. Young people generally commit a variety of violent and non-violent offenses. In recent years, researchers have begun to explore whether violent and delinquent behaviour in adolescence and young adulthood is part of a general pattern of antisocial and aggressive behaviour that emerges during childhood or whether it is the result of certain personal, situational and environmental factors. Some children, for example, exhibit stubborn, defiant, and disobedient behaviour at very young ages, and progress to mild and eventually more severe forms of aggressive and delinquent behaviour by adolescence and young adulthood. Other children either do not exhibit serious problem behaviour until they reach adolescence or seem to outgrow aggressive behaviour by the time they enter primary school. For violence prevention purposes, it is important to know the extent to which patterns of aggressive and antisocial behaviour in childhood are predictive of violent and delinquent behaviour at later ages and also to know which factors increase or buffer the risk for violent and delinquent behaviours at different ages. Understanding this continuity or change in behaviour during different developmental periods is important for identifying appropriate points for intervention. The purpose of this presentation is, thus, threefold: (1) to describe the developmental pathways of aggressive, violent and delinquent behaviour, (2) to describe the factors that increase or buffer against the risk for violent and delinquent behaviour at different ages and across developmental periods and (3) to discuss the implications of the different patterns of behaviour and risk for designing preventive interventions.",

      "abstract": "There are significant ethical. practical and theoretical issues that need to be considered when measuring body composition in normal children. For example, when evaluating the use of techniques that involve ionizing radiation, then the benefit to the volunteer subject, or society at large, needs to be balanced against the likely harm to the subject. For children, the detriment per unit dose may be two to three times larger than that for young adults. At present the decision as to the acceptable radiation dose limit for healthy children undergoing research studies remains debatable. Most techniques for measuring body composition require specific validation of their precision and accuracy when used with small subjects; adaptation of existing methods may thus be necessary in order to measure children. In addition, techniques such as densitometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry may be impractical for use in young children. A major theoretical issue to be considered is that most body composition techniques assume a constant density or chemical composition of the fat-free mass (FFM). However, the FFM in children does not consist of fixed proportions of water, protein and mineral; rather, the proportions of these change during growth, with water content decreasing and protein and mineral content increasing. Caution must therefore be used in the application of adult-derived body composition constants and equations to children.",

However, the physiological consequences are not limited to health symptoms and signs but transcend the social field. In fact, the stigma and discrimination faced by obese people has been proven in multiple areas (work, family, education, etc...). This can contribute to reduce the quality of patients life. From a gender perspective, in the literature there seems to be evidence that the undesirable social effects of obesity affect women more than men. To minimize the obesity impact people adopt proactive methods to lose weight. However the solution to this problem is not on medication but changes in lifestyle and in the proposal of inclusive aesthetic models. Also it is necessary to clear that the complex etiology of obesity can help to reduce the weight stigma and the negative consequences of this condition.",

More apparent are the data that suggest “younger age feeling” represents various dimensions of physical, psychological, and social well-being.

Emotional stability is the process in which the personality is continuously striving for greater sense of emotional health, both intra-physically and intra-personally. Emotionally stable individuals are calm and happy, they are satisfied with their life; they deal with the situation in perfect way and solve their problems easily. As population aging becomes more and more pronounced, the concern for mental health and wellbeing of older people is also increasing. With the unprecedented increase in the number of oldest adults, several studies have paid attention to centenarians and their lives exploring factors related to longevity, such as health, generic influences, general life style etc. However, till date in India, research on aging was primarily confined to socio-demographic profiles, problems of and services to the aged etc. As a result certain issues related to the problems of elderly have received in sufficient and one such area is elderly well-being, self-esteem and mental health. Even speculation about the nature of the problem has been difficult because of invisibility and sensitiveness of the problem. The elderly often experience mental health issues and mental disorders.

      "abstract": "With increasing numbers of women postponing childbearing until after the age of 30, the issue of delayed pregnancy and parenthood, seen against the increased risk of infertility, becomes complex. After devoting time to professional or personal concerns, both women and men face the disheartening result that physiological changes may make conception impossible. Postponing Parenthood: The Effect of Age on Reproductive Potential is an important resource for learning, in advance, how the aging process directly influences the physical ability of an adult to start a family. Gale A. Sloan, R.N., an expert medical writer specializing in issues of fertility and aging, compassionately looks at the circumstances that couples who have put off childbearing, or who are considering doing so, must handle. These include the overall effect of age on a woman's potential to conceive; the biological and genetic risks facing both women and men; the painstaking precautions a couple must exercise to protect or enhance fertility; the accurate medical details concerning conception; the new technological treatments that allow more women to carry to term safely; the psychological influence of parental age on the development of a child; and the time to consider adoption as a reasonable option in beginning parenthood. Many books discuss the issue of infertility, but Postponing Parenthood strives to diminish the possibility of this condition occurring. Enhancing the discussion with a detailed questionnaire exploring signs that may indicate infertility, Ms. Sloan carefully outlines the steps to facilitate conception, how to know if it is taking too long, and the specific medical consultation to seek. This is extremelyimportant because many of the experts in the United States lack sufficiently extensive training and knowledge of current technological treatments in the field of infertility.

      "title": "An insight on gender‐based violence",
      "abstract": "Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global concern for health and human rights, defined as any harmful act targeted at an individual or group based on their gender. It is deeply rooted in gender inequality, the misuse of power, and detrimental norms.1 This term encompasses individuals from all backgrounds, irrespective of their socioeconomic status. Although not always perpetrated by men against women, which is the most common global manifestation, it stems from imbalanced power dynamics between men and women and factors such as illiteracy, poverty, and low social standing. Risk factors linked to engaging in violence include a history of alcohol abuse and family violence, poor mental health, low education and socioeconomic status, borderline personality disorders, and emotional insecurities.2 When directed at women, GBV poses a significant barrier to reproductive health, resulting in increased maternal mortality, unsafe abortions, restricted access to prenatal care, insufficient maternal weight gain, and an increased likelihood of adolescent pregnancies. This can lead to unintended pregnancies, complications, sexually transmitted infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and, in the most severe cases, fatalities.3 Despite its global impact, GBV is not acknowledged as a public health issue, thus it is necessary to understand the impact of GBV on the health and well-being of women and children (https://www.who.int/news/item/25-11-2021-gender-based-violence-is-a-public-health-issue-using-a-health-systems-approach).4 Hence, our letter addresses the crucial issue of GBV worldwide and proposes implementations that can aid in curtailing the same. GBV transcends age, religion, classes, and national boundaries, manifesting itself in various contexts such as the family, workplace, public spaces, communities, states, and even during pregnancy or times of conflict.4 Domestic violence against women or violence that occurs between intimate partners is the most prevalent form of GBV.1 Studies reveal that one in seven homicides worldwide is perpetrated by an intimate partner. While men are at greater risk of homicide overall, the proportion of murdered women killed by an intimate partner is six times higher than for murdered men.5 GBV is pervasive across many Asian-Pacific countries, yet it often remains a topic shrouded in social silence. However, there is a growing acknowledgment of GBV as a significant public health concern in the region. Research conducted in India indicates a connection between experiencing physical violence, a reduced inclination to adopt contraception, and an increased likelihood of unwanted pregnancies.6 Similarly, studies in various countries, such as the Maldives and Pakistan, have identified that instances of physical abuse are linked to higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriages, late pregnancy bleeding, premature labor or delivery, stillbirths, abortions, and delayed initiation of prenatal care (https://arrow.org.my/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AFC-Vol.17-No.2-2011_Gender-based-Violence-and-Health-Sector.pdf). Notably, during the pandemic, GBV experienced an alarming surge, China witnessed a tripling of cases and helpline calls increasing by 20-90% in countries like Colombia, Mexico, Australia, Cyprus, and the United States.7 A comprehensive study that investigates the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on the mental health of Tunisian women and the occurrence of GBV, this research covers all regions of Tunisia and involves 751 participants. The findings reveal that more than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms. Additionally, women who encountered abuse faced an increased risk of psychological violence, evident in 96% of cases.8 Moreover, recent data have shown that the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among women who have experienced violence is twice as high as in women who have not.9 The countless statistics available online shed light on the pervasive nature of GBV, necessitating a global response with stringent measures in place to combat this issue effectively. To tackle GBV, various essential measures can be implemented. In situations where services to address violence against women are limited, establishing a 24-hour emergency response, including shelter safety planning and legal aid, would help ensure the safety of survivors in immediate danger. Concurrently, awareness campaigns should be designed considering the cultural and social nuances of specific regions, such as developing countries. It is imperative to enhance healthcare workers' understanding of GBV through targeted training programs that consider local customs. Additionally, strict laws must be enacted to serve as deterrents, punishing abusers and setting examples for society. Further, regular screenings are vital for early detection of GBV cases, while accounting for cultural norms and the social dynamics between healthcare providers and patients. Importantly, promoting women's literacy and financial independence is of utmost importance, enabling them to challenge gender roles and break free from abusive situations. Considerably, strengthening social support networks through community-based programs is also crucial, taking into consideration the unique challenges faced by different communities (https://www.concern.net/news/solutions-to-gender-based-violence). Lastly, behavioral interventions addressing the root causes of GBV, such as harmful gender norms, will contribute to fostering healthy relationships and achieving equality. However, it is essential to recognize that healthcare screening practices may vary across regions, as cultural factors, such as husbands accompanying wives to medical appointments or social ties between healthcare providers and patients in rural areas, can impact their effectiveness. Therefore, it is essential to adapt all interventions to local communities and conditions, drawing on the wisdom and experiences shared by local survivors of GBV. Hence, by incorporating these localized perspectives, the fight against GBV can make significant progress on a global scale.10 Khushi Ochani: Writing—original draft, writing—review and editing.

Insufficient processing of and coping with development-related challenges can lead to disorders not anchored exclusively in either physical, mental, or social factors, but which float between these three dimensions. These include immune system insufficiency, lack of physical activity, excess nutrition, overweight, unproductive coping with moods, depressive and aggressive tensions, and consumption of psychoactive substances. In adolescence, the different process of reconciling mental individuation and social integration can give rise to transitory and lasting disorders which affect the health-disease balance. Adolescent risk behavior is an specific expression of this developmental problem. Gender-specific differences are obvious.

      "title": "Menstrual problems in adolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract During adolescence, girls become preoccupied with the physical and emotional changes which occur over a number of years, and which translate the girl into a fully sexually and reproductively competent adult female. These changes are also associated with changes in emotional and intellectual status, which identify the adult female as different from the adult male. The outward changes of breast growth, pubic hair and axillary hair growth, and the attainment of full adult height usually precede the outward manifestation of maturity, i.e. the menarche. For many girls their first menstrual period is truly the sign of adulthood and psychologically extremely important to achieve. However, it is also associated with times of stress and the absolute wish to be normal. Thus, changes that occur which are abnormal may have a very serious impact on psychological well-being. Being normal as an adolescent and accepted as a normal member of that peer group is extremely important. In differentiating the range of normality from true abnormality, an understanding of the onset and control of puberty is essential, as in many cases, misinformation leads these adolescent teenagers to states of anxiety which can be well avoided, and a deep knowledge and understanding of the adolescent will make management effective and help her to achieve normal adulthood. In fact, in some cases, poor management of menstrual problems at the time of adolescence may leave her with a life-long menstrual phobia which may be used in later life as a prop against adversity.",

      "title": "Risk factors for early sexual activity and early unplanned pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "The major emphasis of recent literature on adolescent sexuality and pregnancy has been on the important social consequences of early sexual activity; little attention has been given to the risk factors that serve as antecedents to an unplanned adolescent pregnancy. Although the risk factors for early initiation of sexual activity vary in different populations of adolescents they include the transition to puberty peer and sibling influences poverty family structure and function poor school achievement other problem behaviors and inadequate contraceptive use. Adolescents living in poverty are more likely than their middle-class counterparts to begin sexual activity at an early age and to become pregnant in adolescence. Other aspects of family structure that place adolescents at risk are single-parent families large numbers of siblings lack of parental supervision and a pregnant adolescent sister. The adolescents negative experience with school also has been associated with teen pregnancy. In many cases there is a clustering of risk-taking behaviors such as smoking alcohol and drug abuse unprotected sexual intercourse and driving while intoxicated. Social influences including the sexual behavior of best friends appear to be key in determining age at onset of sexual activity among teenage girls while level of physical development and free testosterone levels exert a greater impact on adolescent males. Another risk factor is the 9-12 month median delay between the onset of teen sexual activity and the 1st attempt to seek family planning care from a medical provider. To assess these risk factors physicians who care for adolescents should elicit information about family social background friends school and career plans drug use and physical development. Preventive efforts will be successful only when they address the complexity of the issue of adolescent sexuality.",

Learning is more vulnerable to distraction, verbal memory is reduced, and strategies for putting facts into long-term memory become less efficient. Crystallized intelligence, the store of accumulated knowledge and experience, continues to increase throughout life. Fluid intelligence, the ability to manipulate the crystallized store, diminishes through adulthood. Most sensory systems exhibit higher thresholds and less specificity with increasing age.

They expect – incorrectly – increases in young adulthood and decreases during old age. These errors are large, ranging from 9.8% at age 21 to -4.5% at age 68, they are stable over time and observed across socio-economic groups.

      "title": "DO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FEEL EXCLUDED? COMPARISON OF LEARNING AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Little prior research has examined altitudinal differences between those with learning and physical disabilities, but an enhanced understanding can be critical to institutions in order to better work with people across range of disability types. Then are expected to be specific differences in disability attitudes between people with physical and learning disabilities. People with physical disabilities are hypothesised to report greater feelings of exclusion, pride, and social activism, whereas people with learning disabilities will have greater tendency to value treatment assistance from doctors. Hypotheses were generally supported. Attitudes of people with physical disabilities are often different from those of people with learning disabilities, distinction that requires understanding, acknowledgment, sensitivity and appmpriate interaction.Keywords: learning disability; physical disability; attitudes; orientation; social; exclusion1. IntroductionAccording to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (U.S. Department of Justice, 1991), disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.... The U.S. Census Bureau (2003) describes and tracks certain types of disabilities, some more physical and some more learning-oriented. For example a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying would be classified as physical disability. Sensory disabilities, such as blindness, deafness, or severe vision or hearing impairment, might also be considered more physical in nature. However, difficulty remembering, or concentrating would more accurately describe learning disability. According to U.S. Census data for the year 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003), there are 30.5 million people with physical, sight or hearing disabilities, and 12.4 million with disabilities relating to learning, remembering, or concentrating.Learning disabilities are disorders that affect the ability to understand or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention (National Institutes of Health, 2011). Learning disabilities occur in very young children, but are not usually recognized until school age. About 8 to 10 percent of American children under 18 years old have some type of learning disability (National Institutes of Health, 2011). Thus, learning disabilities are prevalent but are more difficult to recognize and define in comparison to physical disabilities.There can be tension between two alternatives for people with learning disabilities: 1) passing as non-disabled, thus avoiding immediate potential stigmatization, but risking unintended exposure; and 2) proactive disclosure, acknowledging potential stigmatization and getting assistance for the disability. Of course, there are many alternatives in between, in which disclosure can be made selectively to certain individuals but not others. It has been suggested that learning disabilities can be more stressful and psychologically damaging than physical disabilities, because of ambivalence regarding disclosure (Patterson and Blum, 1996). This leads to interesting questions regarding the emotional and cognitive processing dynamics of people with learning disabilities, in contrast to those with physical disabilities.The purpose of the current research is to specifically compare, for people with learning versus physical disabilities, specific attitudes toward their disability. Those with physical disabilities are more likely to define themselves as disabled, because their disabilities are more obvious and affect many aspects of their lives. Those with learning disabilities, on the other hand, may feel normal in many life situations which do not involve cognitive prowess (family life, sports, social events, etc.), potentially providing more incentive to pass as non-disabled. …",

However, it may become socially unacceptable or it may be associated with other medical problems and will therefore present to the growth clinic. The initial approach to tall stature is similar to that used for short stature. It is important to assess the child's height against standard growth charts and to decide whether the child has normal body proportions or not. There will be a number of children with proportionate tall stature whose growth falls into the upper centiles of the normal distribution and some of these may be predicted from analysis of parental heights.",

      "abstract": "This chapter concerns the way in which maturity may be assessed. It will concentrate on the assessment of the process of maturation from birth through childhood and adolescence, i.e. the period of time in which maturation interacts with growth. It is important, therefore, to understand the difference between 'growth' and 'maturation'. Bogin (1999) defines the former as 'a quantitative increase in size or mass' such as increases in height or weight. Development or maturation, on the other hand, is defined as 'a progression of changes, either quantitative or qualitative, that lead from an undifferentiated or immature state to a highly organized, specialized, and mature state'. The end point of maturation, within the context of the growth, is the attainment of adulthood, which may be defined as a 'functionally mature individual'. Functional maturation, in a biological context, implies the ability to successfully procreate and raise offspring who themselves will successfully procreate. We know that in addition to the obvious functional necessities of sperm and ova production, reproductive success within any mammalian society is also dependent on a variety of morphological characteristics such as size and shape. The too short or too tall, the too fat or too thin are unlikely to achieve the same reproductive success as those within an 'acceptable' range of height and weight values that are themselves dependent on the norms in a particular society.",

These children show extreme and enduring forms of gender nonconforming/gender variant behaviours, preferences, and interests because they do not identify with their birthassigned gender. Because of the incongruence between their assigned gender and experienced gender, these children may experience clinically significant distress and are consequently often in need of clinical attention (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).",

The association between fibrinogen and social isolation, as measured by low indegree, is comparable to the effect of smoking, and greater than that of low education, a conventional measure of socioeconomic disadvantage. By contrast, outdegree, which reflects an individual's perceived connectedness, displays a significantly weaker association with fibrinogen concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology, and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this paper, I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is a biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental, or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation, it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory, and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

Previous studies have addressed this concern by instrumenting with twinning or older-sibling sex composition. These instruments have been criticized for the large sample size required by the former and the possible endogeneity of both. This paper proposes religious denomination (Catholicism, in particular) as an alternative instrument. Using data from the British National Child Development Study, I estimate the effect of family size in cognitive test scores, emotional development measures, and earnings. While ordinary least squares estimates show a quality-quantity trade-off in all three measures of achievement, instrumental variables estimates indicate either zero or positive effects of additional siblings. By contrast, birth order does not consistently affect child achievement.",

      "abstract": "Life history traits are often used to distinguish equilibrium from nonequilibrium populations. This is invalid, both within the framework of r- and K-selection theory and within a demographic model which takes age structure into account. In both cases, the patterns favored in an equilibrium population are even more intensely favored in a nonequilibrium population which happens to spend most of its history in a state of population decline. The only characteristic which seems to distinguish equilibrium populations is a lower absolute magnitude of selective pressure on some traits. The traits favored in declining populations include long lifespan, slow development, delayed reproduction, iteroparity, low degree of senescence, and perhaps a relatively high degree of investment in whatever offspring are produced. The traits favored in increasing nonequilibrium populations are largely the opposite: short life, fast development, and early reproduction, semelparity, senescence, and perhaps less investment in individual offspring. There appears to be an evolutionary instability in the center of the gradient from predominantly increasing to predominantly decreasing populations. Over evolutionary time, nonequilibrium populations will diverge in one direction or the other. This model predicts the existence of suites of species with distinctly \"declining\" (i.e., K-selected) characteristics, and other groups with distinctly \"increasing\" (i.e., r-selected) characteristics. Because the same traits that increase the proportion of its history that a population spends in decline also increase the time required for extinction, the former group will occupy relatively stable habitats, the latter group more disturbed habitats. This requires no equilibrium assumptions; all of the species involved may be local losers. The predictions of the model are supported by an analysis of the relation between competitive tolerance, age at first reproduction, and life span in North American trees.",

The chapter addresses the question of what makes a person physically attractive or beautiful. There are simple anthropometric characteristics which are common to all bodies generally considered to be beautiful. These characteristics include symmetry, an hourglass shape, and slimness. Somatotype is a way of quantifying the shape of the human body, independent of size. Somatotype is usually assessed anthropometrically, that is by taking measurements.

      "title": "A11. The influence of the media on eating disorders",
      "abstract": "Background The cause of eating disorders is multifactorial. One of these is sociocultural factors which include family, peers and the media. It has been suggested that constant media pressures can lead to body dissatisfaction, which may result in distorted eating patterns. Aims To review the role of the media in relation to eating disorders Results There has been a shift in the media portrayal of the ’ideal’ body size for women, from the voluptuous curved figure of Marilyn Monroe in the 1950s to a thinner ’waif‐like’ look of Kate Moss in the 1980s. In the mass media shape and weight define perfection. Women perceive themselves as being bigger than they actually are. Their figure deviates from the ideal thus resulting in self body dissatisfaction. ’All I see is these pretty models, I wish I could look like one of them.’ ( Wertheim et al . 1997 ) The ’ideal’ body image is far from the physiologic norm. Supermodels are born with a specific body type and what the public doesn’t understand is that they cannot diet to achieve it. ’Women don’t set out to be anorexic, they begin by thinking they’re too fat because everywhere they go the media is telling them that they are right’ ( Barrett, 1997 ) Products are often advertised displaying the ideal body shape in the hope that it will enhance the product and create body dissatisfaction. Purchasing the product is perceived as a positive step towards reaching the ’perfect’ body image. Concern surrounds the appearance of such advertisements in magazines aimed at adolescent girls, as at this age they are particularly vulnerable to the influences of the media. Stice and Shaw (1994) stated that exposure to the thin ’idea’ may have a negative effect on emotions leading to body dissatisfaction. Such emotions include depression, stress, guilt, shame, insecurity, unhappiness, and lower self‐confidence. A study by Schotte et al . (1990) indicated that negative emotions can disrupt eating behaviour. Dieters watching a frightening film increased their food intake, whereas nondieters did not. Conclusion The media are not solely responsible for eating disorders but they do contribute by promoting the ’ideal’ physique. There is some resistance to media messages, as the majority of people do not develop distorted eating patterns.",

On each of four dimensions of instrumentality, autonomy, acceptability, and integrity, ideal people were characterized more positively than real or typical ones. Age of neither participant or stimulus object affected these judgments. Stereotypes emerged when typical people were rated, though judgments on real people suggested little difference between elderly and middle-aged people. However, real adolescents were judged to be more unacceptable, dependent, and instrumental than were middle-aged and elderly adults. On instrumentality the age groups differed in their perceptions of each other. Adolescents and middle-aged adults perceived instrumentality to decline in old age, but the elderly did not agree. Thus attitudes reflected stereotypes when broad categorical decisions were required, but stereotypes broke down when known people were characterized.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN Todos los seres vivos como condicion natural tienen un instinto de supervivencia que les obliga a preservar la especie. Ya desde que el hombre es consciente de su evolucion ha intentado prolongar su vida e incluso inmortalizarla. Una vez desechado el sueno de la inmortalidad, el hombre se ha centrado en el objetivo de incrementar su supervivencia con mejores condiciones fisicas y mentales. Los habitos saludables, la adecuada nutricion, la higiene, el diagnostico precoz de enfermedades y el avance en los tratamientos de enfermedades, han logrado en los ultimos 100 anos, duplicar la expectativa de vida de la especie. De este modo la longevidad o supervivencia de la especie humana ha conseguido una mejora espectacular en la vida media aunque no en la vida maxima, La supervivencia es un parametro especifico de cada especie, en el que claramente existe una implicacion genetica que explicaria las diferentes tasas de supervivencia entre las especies. La longevidad de las especies viene determinada por su longevidad media y maxima. La longevidad maxima corresponde a la edad del individuo mas longevo de la especie y la media corresponde a un dato estadistico en el cual el 50 % de la poblacion sigue aun viva. Existen factores intrinsecos y extrinsecos que pueden afectar a las diferentes longevidades entre individuos. De este modo los factores extrinsecos afectarian principalmente a la vida media, por ejemplo un habito de vida saludable esta correlacionado con una mayor probabilidad de supervivencia. Existen numerosos datos estadisticos que muestran diferencias de longevidades entre paises, hecho que se puede atribuir a los diferentes habitos de vida. Respecto a la vida maxima de las especies, son los factores intrinsecos los que mas implicados estan, de modo que el material genetico es el que determinaria las diferentes longevidades (figura 5.2). En los estudios de modificaciones geneticas relacionadas con la longevidad, cabe destacar la creacion de una mosca transgenica que sobreexpresa dos enzimas antioxidantes, la catalasa y la superoxido dismutasa (Orr and Sohal, 1994). Estas moscas presentan un incremento tanto en la vida media como en la maxima respecto de sus controles, este hecho demuestra en parte la teoria del estres oxidativo y la longevidad, ya que individuos que presentan una mayor defensa frente al estres oxidativo son significativamente mas longevos. Ademas a lo largo de estos anos se han identificado en Drosophila otros genes que al ser sobreexpresados o silenciados modifican la longevidad de la especie. Esta tesis trata de mostrar como podemos modificar genes que estan directamente relacionados con la longevidad, simplemente cambiando nuestros habitos alimenticios. De este modo, podemos cuidar nuestro envejecimiento comiendo sano hoy para encontrarnos mejor manana. __________________________________________________________________________________________________",

Hardship indicators are increasingly influential, so the source of the gradient has considerable policy implications. We propose a theoretical and empirical strategy to decompose the sources of this relationship. We exploit a unique feature of the Household, Income & Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey, which collects reports of hardship from all adult household members, facilitating within-couple estimates. The majority of the relationship is explained by observed resources, particularly wealth and home ownership. One third of the relationship is explained by unobserved differences between households, which we interpret as age-related behavioural choices. Reporting error does not appear to contribute to the age gradient.",

      "abstract": "There is clear evidence that the mother's stress, anxiety, or depression during pregnancy can alter the development of her fetus and her child, with an increased risk for later psychopathology. We are starting to understand some of the underlying mechanisms including the role of the placenta, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, and specific systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and cytokines. In this review we also consider how these effects may be different, and potentially exacerbated, in different parts of the world. There can be many reasons for elevated prenatal stress, as in communities at war. There may be raised pregnancy-specific anxiety with high levels of maternal and infant death. There can be raised interpersonal violence (in Afghanistan 90.2% of women thought that \"wife beating\" was justified compared with 2.0% in Argentina). There may be interactions with nutritional deficiencies or with extremes of temperature. Prenatal stress alters the microbiome, and this can differ in different countries. Genetic differences in different ethnic groups may make some more vulnerable or more resilient to the effects of prenatal stress on child neurodevelopment. Most research on these questions has been in predominantly Caucasian samples from high-income countries. It is now time to understand more about prenatal stress and psychopathology, and the role of both social and biological differences, in the rest of the world.",

      "abstract": "Most people are motivated to self-expand, collecting new attributes and experiences in a process that boosts well-being, but people with low self-concept clarity resist it. Perhaps, then, there is a tradeoff between self-expansion and self-concept clarity. Across a 2-week daily dairy, we found no evidence for such a tradeoff—self-expanding was not associated with lower self-concept clarity, either that day, the next day, or the period as a whole. In fact, self-expansion was associated with higher self-concept clarity, but especially for people with lower initial self-concept clarity. Although they were less likely to self-expand on a daily basis, when they did self-expand, they reported higher self-concept clarity and, in turn, greater satisfaction with life. These findings suggest that self-expansion in daily life does not come at the cost of a coherent self-concept and that despite their reluctance, people with lower self-concept clarity may experience associated benefits from self-expanding.",

Americans' attitudes toward evolution at least partially depend on their religious or political values, and prior work has argued that knowledge of the theory plays a negligible role. But there have been no systematic, large-scale attempts to measure the public's knowledge of evolutionary theory, which means that claims about a lack of significant impact of evolution knowledge on evolution acceptance may be premature. Using a new demographically representative survey (N = 1100) that includes a detailed measure of evolution knowledge, we find that knowledge predicts level of acceptance, even after accounting for the effects of religion and politics. These results demonstrate that Americans' views on evolution are significantly influenced by their knowledge about this theory and therefore might be amenable to change.",

      "abstract": "Despite the significant health benefits of regular physical activity for older adults, only a minority achieve recommended levels. To develop effective interventions, the reasons for the low levels of physical activity in this population must be understood. The present review identifies and synthesizes qualitative studies concerning the acceptability of physical activity to community dwelling older adults. A systematic search of four electronic databases identified 10 studies meeting inclusion criteria. These were appraised, and findings were combined and compared using thematic synthesis. Older adults construed physical activity as a by-product of other activities, rather than as a purposeful activity within itself. This seemed to be linked to their self-perception as an ageing member of society, with physical activity considered irrelevant, and competing roles and responsibilities (e.g., family) taking precedence. Additionally, older adults appeared to experience conflict between maintaining their autonomy and accepting the physical and social vulnerabilities associated with ageing. As older adults do not see physical activity as purposeful within itself, interventions promoting moderate or vigorous physical activity are likely to have limited success. As even small increases in physical activity benefit older adults, future interventions may wish to target the reduction of sedentary behaviour in this population.",

      "abstract": "Using ethnographic and survey data on low-income families residing in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we examine the relationship between women's patterns of union formation and their experience of physical and sexual abuse. Both sets of data suggest that women who have been physically or sexually abused are substantially less likely to be married or to be in stable, long-term cohabiting relationships. The data also suggest that the timing and different forms of abuse may have distinctive associations with union formation. Women who have experienced abuse beginning in childhood, particularly sexual abuse, are less likely to be in sustained marriages or stable cohabiting relationships and instead are more likely to experience transitory unions: multiple short-term, mostly cohabiting unions with brief intervals between them. Women who have not been abused in childhood but experience adult physical abuse, however, are less likely to be in either a marriage or a cohabiting union, long-term or transitory; and some have withdrawn from having relationships with men. The relevance of these findings for the decline of marriage among low-income women and men is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sexual behaviors in children are common, occurring in 42 to 73 percent of children by the time they reach 13 years of age. Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

      "title": "Natural Aging and the Effects of Radiation",
      "abstract": "Neither studies of occupational exposure nor military experiments, deliberate and accidental, have yet yielded satisfactory evidence on the long- term effects of radiation on individual human aging or on the life span of human populations. Natural aging is defined as a proressive decline in vigor with increasing age, which is probably universal in warm-blooded vertebrates. The mechanisms which bring about mammalian aging are wholly unknown, and it can be discussed only in the most general descriptive terms. It is not known whether the loss of vigor occurs at a cellular or a tissue level, whether there is a timekeeping process common to all manmmals, or whether aging is an assemhly of processes whose only commoa propenty is that they increase vulnerability. Results of studies on rats give some evidence that aging may be dissociable from general metabolism. Results are reviewed from a number of studies on animal survival in which factors other than radiation are considered. Data are summarized from a number of studies on the long-term effects of irradiation on life span. Survival curves of control and irradiated animals are compared. All the experimental studies indicate that ionizing radiations, at least above a certain threshold of exposure, shorten life.more » It is pointed out that the observations are difficult to compare because of their heterogeneity in type, relative efficiency, variation in methods of radiation dosimetry, choice of animals and strain, methods of analysis, and methods of expressing results. It is also pointed out that mathematical consideration of possible mechanisms in radiation injury has so far outstripped experiment. It is concluded that radiation biology can offer fundsmental information about natural aging processes. The author states that sufficient time has now been devoted to experiments in which radiations have been administered to animals and shown to do them no good. This point having been established, it should be possible to fix the requirements for more instructive compsrisons. Some areas for future research are suggested. 66 references. (C.H.)« less",

Successful coordination, as well as individual wellbeing, benefit when we also perceive others as trustworthy, reasonable or well-intentioned. While standard measures of trust and benevolence exist, there is no standard measure of the generalised belief in the rationality or reasonableness of other people. Here, we present the development and testing of a scale to directly measure this attitude. Using a representative sample of 1869 UK adults, we test dimensionality and consistency of the scale items. We show that the refined, six-item, scale is associated with, but not entirely determined by, generalised trust in other people. Our \"Faith in Reason\" scale shows large individual differences, but the average tendency is slightly on the side of endorsing, rather than rejecting, sentiments such as \"The typical person is often irrational\".",

      "abstract": "Young men with superior upper-body strength typically show a greater proclivity for physical aggression than their weaker male counterparts. The traditional interpretation of this phenomenon is that young men calibrate their attitudes and behaviors to their physical formidability. Physical strength is thus viewed as a causal antecedent of aggressive behavior. The present study is the first to examine this phenomenon within a developmental framework. We capitalized on the fact that physical strength is a male secondary sex characteristic. In two longitudinal cohorts of children, we estimated adolescent change in upper-body strength using the slope parameter from a latent growth model. We found that males’ antisocial tendencies temporally precede their physical formidability. Boys, but not girls, with greater antisocial tendencies in childhood attained larger increases in physical strength between the ages of 11 and 17. These results support sexual selection theory, indicating an adaptive congruence between male-typical behavioral dispositions and subsequent physical masculinization during puberty.",

      "abstract": "Summary Psychic sex consists of gender identity (self-estimation), gender role (objective estimation of the behavior) and psycho-sexual orientation (hetero-, bi- or homosexual). It was believed that gender identification depends on the socio-environmental influences such as rearing, learning and individual choice. It has become recently evident that endogenous hormones more than socio-environmental factors may create sexually dimorphic gender identification and role. Experiments revealed that transient action of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol) during perinatal life is crucial for the development of male sexual behavior in adulthood. In human male testosterone, produced perinatally in adult-type amounts, may play a role in the masculinisation of the brain i.e. creation of physiological and behavioral differences versus the female brain. In patients with disturbances of sexual differentiation of external genitalia (intersexuality) gender identity is also affected. Female gender identity is associated with the presence of ovaries or the lack of gonads (agenesis/dysgenesis), i.e. lack of sex steroids in fetal life. Male gender identity appears in the presence of testicular tissue (presence of testosterone in fetal life) irrespective of karyotype and phenotype of the body. In genetic men with the absence of male genitalia due to aberrant function of the androgen receptor (46,XY women), gender identity depends on the severity of the disorder: female - in the complete form and female, male or ambivalent - in the partial. These indicate that androgens are involved in the creation of male gender identity, whereas a female identity develops in the absence of androgen action during sexual differentiation.",

This situation has given rise to diverse varieties of training practices: fitness, muscle building, body building.

Although these practices are spreading among both sexes, today they are still relatively scarce among women when compared with men.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

We find support for the affect intensity rationale showing that women are relatively more affected in their satisfaction about life by the good or bad events or achievements occurring during their existence and less resilient (less likely to revert to their standard levels of happiness after a shock). We as well discuss biological, genetic, cultural, personality rationales advocated in the literature that can explain our findings.",

      "abstract": "The automobile is essential for many older adults to fulfill their daily needs, especially since many live where they lack access to public transit or other acceptable modes of transportation. Increased self-regulation is one way older drivers continue to drive safely and maintain mobility. This research considers whether self-regulation attitudes and patterns differ by gender. Results indicate that women and men report distinct patterns of self-regulation behaviors. Age, health status, and household status also interact with gender, influencing the extent of self-regulation. The results also show that women report lower levels of confidence in their driving skills than men, although the difference varies based on whether or not a woman lives alone. Implications of these results are considered for an aging population—particularly women—that over the coming decades will be more reliant on the automobile for transportation than ever before.",

      "abstract": "Gender identity is each person's internal sense of being a woman, a man, both, neither, or anywhere along the gender spectrum, which may (cisgender) or may not (transgender) coincide with the sex assigned at birth. The multiple difficulties experienced by transgender individuals constitutes a risk factor for mood disorders and self-harming behaviors. However, knowledge about biological influences on gender identity development has the potential to reduce the stigmatization of gender minorities. We conducted a literature review of the available literature on the biological basis of gender identity, summarizing the main scientific evidence in the field in addition to its limitations. A growing body of research supports that the broad spectrum that characterizes gender identity constitutes a multifactorial trait with a heritable component. At the neuroanatomical level, this model translates to the high variability observed in the degree of masculinization/feminization of different features within a single brain, with considerable overlap between different gender identities at the individual level. Hence, neither genetic variants nor neuroanatomic measures can be used to identify or predict an individual's gender identity. The evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction lies in the huge increase in variation produced among individuals. The continuous distribution of gender identities in the population appears to be just one more aspect of sexual reproduction as a source of variability.",

Women experience sexual pleasure on many levels: physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual. Sexual functioning of women and men is determined by many factors. A strong correlation between the state of subjective arousal and genital response (erection) is typical for men. In the case of women important role played: emotions, cognitive interpretation of the situation, age, self-esteem and previous sexual experiences. Among women experience orgasm during intercourse or masturbation is not a goal in itself. Modern approach to the phenomenon of orgasm and sexual education of women, make absence of orgasm as a failure. It becomes a source of low self-esteem, less self-confidence or sense of lack of attractiveness.",

      "title": "Inclusive Fitness, Altruism and Family Adaptation",
      "abstract": "An integrative model of family functioning is put forward using a sociobiological framework. Three key sociobiological concepts that have a relevance to family interaction are inclusive fitness, altruism, and a struggle for status. The term 'inclusive fitness' encompasses the parents' own fitness and that of their kith and kin. Altruism refers to how parents promote the survival of their progeny and extended family. The struggle for status refers to a struggle for power and prestige. According to the author's hypothesis 'inclusive fitness' exerts its influence through the struggle for status which in turn influences the degree of altruism and the level of 'family adaptation'. The parents' level of inclusive fitness largely determines the level of family adaptation which in turn influences the growth and individuation of the next generation. A common negative outcome of failure in the struggle for status and power is a displacement of the struggle for power into a family context. Failure in a struggle for status between peer group members would in a pretechnological society probably have reflected a relative lack of fitness. Failure in the struggle for status is likely to generate maladaptive cycles in the family which will lower the inclusive fitness of the parents. A concept of ideal family functioning is derived from sociobiology and specifically related to a high inclusive fitness in the parents. The author argues that sociobiological concepts can contribute to the development of an integrative theory of family behaviour. The clinical implications of this model are explored.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundModulation of sexual desires is, in some cases, necessary to avoid inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior (downregulation of sexual desire) or to engage with a romantic partner (upregulation of sexual desire). Some have suggested that those who have difficulty downregulating their sexual desires be diagnosed as having a sexual 'addiction'. This diagnosis is thought to be associated with sexual urges that feel out of control, high-frequency sexual behavior, consequences due to those behaviors, and poor ability to reduce those behaviors. However, such symptoms also may be better understood as a non-pathological variation of high sexual desire. Hypersexuals are thought to be relatively sexual reward sensitized, but also to have high exposure to visual sexual stimuli. Thus, the direction of neural responsivity to sexual stimuli expected was unclear. If these individuals exhibit habituation, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be diminished; if they merely have high sexual desire, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be increased. Neural responsivity to sexual stimuli in a sample of hypersexuals could differentiate these two competing explanations of symptoms.MethodsFifty-two (13 female) individuals who self-identified as having problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli viewed emotional (pleasant sexual, pleasant-non-sexual, neutral, and unpleasant) photographs while electroencephalography was collected.ResultsLarger P300 amplitude differences to pleasant sexual stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, was negatively related to measures of sexual desire, but not related to measures of hypersexuality.ConclusionImplications for understanding hypersexuality as high desire, rather than disordered, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Body size variation is an enigma. We do not understand why species achieve the sizes they do, and this means we also do not understand the circumstances under which gigantism or dwarfism is selected. We develop size-structured integral projection models to explore evolution of body size and life history speed. We make few assumptions and keep models simple: all functions remain constant across models except for the one that describes development of body size with age. We set sexual maturity to occur when size attains 80% of the asymptotic size, which is typical of a large mammal, and allow negative density dependence to only affect either reproduction or juvenile survival. Fitness -- the quantity that is maximized by adaptive evolution -- is carrying capacity in our models, and we are consequently interested in how it changes with size at sexual maturity, and how this association varies with development rate. The simple models generate complex dynamics while providing insight into the circumstances when extremes of body size evolve. The direction of selection leading to either gigantism or dwarfism crucially depends on the proportion of the population that is sexually mature, which in turn depends on how the development function determines the survivorship schedule. The developmental trajectories consequently interact with size-specific survival or reproductive rates to determine the best life history and the optimal body size emerges from that interaction. These dynamics result in trade-offs between different components of the life history, with the form of the trade-off that emerges depending upon where in the life history density dependence operates most strongly. Empirical application of the approach we develop has potential to help explain the enigma of body size variation across the tree of life.",

      "abstract": "The term \"sex recession\" refers to a decline in the willingness to engage in sexual intercourse and, consequently, a reluctance to marry and have offspring. This phenomenon is prevalent in many developed countries, leading to a notable decrease in birth rates and a slowed regeneration process. The long-term impacts of sex recession extend beyond demographic shifts and pose challenges to economic dynamics. As population declines, there is a gradual reduction in consumer needs, resulting in diminished purchasing power and imbalances in supply and demand. This economic passivity poses a significant threat to future economic sustainability. This study employs a phenomenological approach and conducts a comprehensive literature review to explore the multifaceted implications of the sex recession phenomenon. The findings highlight the potential long-term challenges and threats to economic development, emphasizing the urgency of research in this domain to inform strategic interventions and policy decisions.Istilah sex recession dimaknai dengan berkurangnya kemauan untuk melakukan hubungan seksual, atau bahkan ketidak inginan manusia untuk melakukan pernikahan dan mempunyai keturunan. Sex recession banyak terjadi dinegara maju dan tentu saja memiliki dampak pada penurunan angka kelahiran pada suatu Negara dan regenerasi menjadi lambat. Jika hal tersebut terus terjadi jelas akan berdampak juga pada perekonomian. Lambat laun tingkat kebutuhan semakin menurun dikarenakan minimnya populasi, daya beli masyarakat semakin rendah dan terkait pada permintaan dan penawaran yang tidak seimbang sehingga aktifitas ekonomi menjadi pasif. hal ini, menjadi tantangan dan ancaman ekonomi masa depan. Oleh karena itu perluh adanya penelitian terkait hal tersebut, supaya akan menjadi kehati-hatian bagi pelaku sex recession. Kajian ini menggunakan pendekatan fenomenologi, telaah pustaka dengan pencarian data dan informasi secara online terkait fenomena Sex Recession. Dari pendekatan tersebut didapatkan bahwa Sex Recession memiliki dampak jangka panjang terutama pada perekonomian, secara tidak langsung terjadinya resesi seks menjadi tantangan dan ancaman perkembangan ekonomi suatu Negara, jauh ke depan Negara tersebut pun akan terancam dengan resesi ekonomi, karena adanya pengurangan pelaku ekonomi",

They want to enhance their chances for personal fulfillment and to provide a good home and opportunities for their children. The availability of effective contraceptive methods gives couples the opportunity to determine, with dignity and personal freedom, how many children they will have and when they will have them. This reproductive freedom is a human right, not a privilege reserved for the well-to-do. If because of inadequate education, poverty, or lack of health services, people do not have access to effective contraception, there is a de facto denial of this right. Families that are already struggling to meet the needs of existing children should not be deprived of the contraceptive services available to those who are better off. For the poorest of the poor, this struggle is often a matter of providing their children with adequate food and shelter.",

Three studies demonstrate that susceptibility to attitude change is greater during early and late adulthood than during middle adulthood. Three additional studies demonstrate that attitude importance, certainty, and perceived quantity of attitude-relevant knowledge are greater in middle adulthood than during early or late adulthood. These antecedents may therefore explain life cycle shifts in susceptibility to change. Susceptibility to change, importance, certainty, and perceived knowledge differ from one another in terms of their correlations with education, gender, and race, challenging the notion that attitude strength is a unitary construct. Evidence that people incorrectly believe that susceptibility to change declines steadily over the life course reinforces the distinction between operative and meta-attitudinal measures of attitude strength.",

      "title": "Differences in Criminal Behavior and Court Responses among Juvenile and Young Adult Defendants",
      "abstract": "The peak ages of criminality fall between the sixteenth and twentieth birthdays, with participation rates falling off rapidly for older age groups. Young men under the age of twenty-one account for half of all felony arrests. However, these arrest figures tend to overestimate the seriousness of the youthful offender crime problem somewhat because their crimes tend to be less serious and are committed in groups. There is a strong and direct connection between juvenile criminal activity and adult criminal careers. Chronic juvenile offenders have a high probability of continuing in crime as adults, while juveniles who were never arrested are unlikely to develop criminal careers as adults. Predictors of chronic juvenile offending include predelinquent deviant or troublesome behavior, physiological deficits associated with abnormal brain development, poor parenting, and evidence of criminal conduct or mental disorder among parents or siblings. In recent years juvenile and criminal courts have been criticized for failing to deal with young chronic offenders severely enough. The common belief was that the juvenile court was excessively lenient in all types of cases because of its concern for the welfare of the minor, while the criminal courts were probably forced to be lenient because they did not have unrestricted access to juvenile records. Analysis of case disposition patterns suggests that chronic juvenile and young adult offenders are sentenced to incarceration or state custody at least as frequently as is any other age group (for some types of crime) and that the seriousness of their juvenile records affects the severity of their sentences.",

Approved traits such as altruism may not be projected by the non-insightful; they may, however, be projected by the insightful. 11. Altruism is related to the relative value with which relationships are regarded. Relationships which, while prevalent in lay or professional thinking or both, have not been substantiated by the present study include: 1. The individual who attends church or synagogue regularly is apt to be more altruistic than one who does not. 2. The inhibition or control of impulses or desires involved in altruistic behavior is conducive to neurotic symptomology. 3. Those attracted to the sciences are more altruistically inclined than those attracted to law, business, or engineering. 4. The political liberal or leftist is apt to be more altruistic than the conservative or rightist. 5. Professed ease in relationships is correlated with altruism. 6. An child is apt to be significantly more egoistic than the average. Perhaps in the long run the most rewarding product of this study is one that had not been consciously hypothesized: the precipitation from the matrix of a configuration of variables that appears fully consistent with Becker's concept of the sacred pole of the sacred-secular continuum. Appearing as it did as the first dimension to be extracted and accounting for a larger amount of the matrix variance than any of the other seven dimensions which followed (including configurations consistent with the constructs socioeconomic status and social acceptability), it would seem to grant considerable support to Becker's contention that the construct sacred is not only objectively possible but objectively probable.22 If the sacred can be shown by factor analysis to be a dimension underlying the surface relationships between many of the variables of interest to the contemporary sociologist and psychologist, then the construct warrants considerably more attention from the quantitatively-oriented investigator than it has received to date.",

The present study examined emerging adults’ (EAs’) perceptions of transitional (i.e., cohabitating, marriage, parenting) and gradual (i.e., religious beliefs, political beliefs, managing own health) roles. Participants were recruited from a small liberal arts college (N = 88) and from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform (N = 181). They were surveyed on the age at which they anticipated or reported achieving the examined roles and their current self-efficacy for the roles. Female EAs reported intending to or achieving the transitional roles at a significantly later age than female EAs of the late 20th century (ps ≤ .001, ds 0.77–0.95). Additionally, female EAs anticipated role achievement for cohabitating, marriage, parenting, and religious beliefs at later ages than male EAs (ps &lt; .05, gs 0.33–1.33). Moreover, male and female EAs differed in a few role-specific self-efficacies if they had not yet achieved the desired adult role (e.g., marriage, parenting; ps &lt; .05, gs 0.62–0.98), but did not differ if they had already achieved the role. Lastly, the difference between EAs’ age and their role achievement largely did not predict their role-specific self-efficacies. The results provide additional insight into EAs’ expectations and current perceptions of themselves and may be useful to individuals who work regularly with EAs who are apprehensive about the extent to which they are “on time” and “ready” to engage in the examined transitional and gradual roles.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the world, girls and women are interested in their looks. What has been perceived as an enjoyable part of life is however imbued with negative economic and psychological costs which are rarely calculated. International studies confirm the disturbing trend that body dissatisfaction and the perception that one is too large (even if this is not the case) undermine adolescent girls’ academic achievement. It doesn’t lead to failure, but to a diminishing in confidence and hence in performance. The marketing of beauty aimed at girls as young as five through to women in their seventies has made the idea of beauty more accessible but simultaneously, the narrowing of the ideal standard to very young women with one body type, one look, one shape, one colour, one breast or buttock size whose images are then photo-shopped to create bodies that rarely exist in real life - and are frequently unrecognizable to the model herself - has had many unfortunate consequences. The beauty ideals which saturate all media from facebook, to tumblr, to instagram, to mainstream magazines, music videos and billboards, create anxiety and shame around personal appearance.Concern about looks, size, weight, shape and attractiveness filch girls’ and women’s minds, passions and bodies. There is an urgent need for multi-level intervention to reverse the trend of poor body image and poor body confidence. The silent self-attacks are thwarting girls’ ambitions at exactly the time when society is apparently opening up to them. Programmes and social policy that can interrupt the cycle of undermining that is intensifying need to be underpinned by robust research, which can demonstrate the economic and psychological case for underpinning girls’ capability and can demonstrate the effectiveness of such strategies. The substantial economic costs of clinical eating disorders and obesity have been assessed in terms of present and future expenditure to the NHS and opportunities lost for young women. However, no costing exists of the ubiquitous breeding of body insecurity which takes form in the growth of appearance anxiety, body dysmorphias, bulimic behaviours, compulsive eating, and confidence issues, many of which are now normative and widespread among adults and young people. It is urgently required.",

      "abstract": "The observation that disease has an effect on the tissues of the human body is as old as medicine, itself, and was not lost on preliterate and pre-technological societies. Primary changes in the amount, proportions or quality of total body mass, specific organs and specific tissues constitute pathologies; conversely, changes in body composition secondary to and conditioned by diseases are myriad. The classification of most of the associations has been roughly addressed. Nutritional and dietetic therapeutics allows us to intervene to change proportions of fat and lean, while surgery provides some leverage to modify and reconstruct organs and appendages and also to remove excess fat. With respect to these secondary changes due to illness, however, one must determine whether they are generally detrimental or adaptive/accommodative before deciding to intervene. In the context of diet, body composition and ethnicity, ethnic groups differ with respect to their susceptibility to certain diseases and to the severity of their expression. Moreover, differences among different races in body composition are being documented systematically. The future holds in store the ability to analyse the molecular and chemical composition of the body. And we shall be able to focus not merely at the whole-body level, but at regional, segmental and even cellular loci. What must be kept in perspective is ensuring accessibility of the emerging technology to developing nations, as that is where the greatest diversity of both pathology and ethnicity is to be found.",

In recent years the interest in these side effects, having an impact on the quality of life of users, has grown due to several reasons. In the last decades different scientific approaches to gain empirical evidence about the type and extent of negative effects of hormonal contraceptives on mood and sex did not result in clear evidence-based statements due to the complexity of the interaction between contraceptive methods and mental and sexual health (inconsistent measurement of patient reported outcomes, multiplicity of intervening variables etc). Based on an understanding of the biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributing to the mental and sexual health of the individual user, and the individual impact of hormonal contraception, which can have negative, positive or neutral effects on mood and sexuality, an individualized approach is proposed to integrate mental and sexual health into the practice of contraceptive counselling and care.",

      "abstract": "Alteration of day and night is one of the essential circadian rhythms that build the phenomenon of sleep/wake in humans and other animals. Daily rhythms impact different individuals differently. Light exposure and an individual's circadian response are two aspects that create diversity in phenotype. These diverse phenotypes are called chronotypes. Chronotype varies over the life history stages. Chronotype is seen as morning type in children, evening type in adolescents, and again reverts back to the morning type in adults and old-aged individuals. It is observed that adolescents being evening types have bedtime later in comparison to children and adults. Adolescent physiology/ body clock does not allow them to sleep early and school routine/social clock does not let them sleep till late. Thus, their night phase is shrunk and sleep hours are reduced, which hinders their day-time functioning, including mental tasks such as cognition, learning and memory-based exercises, and physical tasks such as physical presence during field and athletic events. These days sleep debt is a critical health concern in the adolescent population. The current review focuses on the adolescent sleep-needs and various factors affecting their healthy sleep. This also encompasses the understanding of biological clocks, their misalignment, disrupters, causes and impact. The present study would be helpful in finding out the difference between the biological clock and social clock of the adolescent population, elaborates the need for sleep education and suggests a solution to this alarming problem of sleep debt in teens.",

      "title": "Evolutionary approach to below replacement fertility",
      "abstract": "Abstract The large human brain, the long period of juvenile dependence, long life span, and male support of reproduction are the co‐evolutionary result of the human niche based on skill‐intensive techniques of resource accrual. The regulation of fertility under traditional conditions is based upon a co‐evolved psychology and physiology where adjustments of investment in offspring depend upon the returns to skill and mortality hazards. When all wealth is somatic, the hormonal system controlling ovulation and implantation translates income into genetic descendants. In modern society the existence of extra‐somatic wealth is a critical condition to which our evolved proximate physiological mechanisms do not respond. However, psychological mechanisms regulating parental investment in offspring quality may lead to greater and greater investment in own and offspring education, a smaller desired family size, a delay in the onset of reproduction, and a reduction in the total numbers of offspring produced. This delay in reproduction can cause many individuals to produce fewer children than desired because fecundity falls during the reproductive part of the life course. As more individuals in a society follow this pattern, more will fail to reach their desired family size. At the same time the effective use of birth control decreases the numbers of families producing more children than desired. Below replacement fertility can result.

Clearly, the actual or chronological age of a child is a most unreliable guide to maturity as each child will mature at a different rate due to influences of its genetics, race, social background, and environment. The measurement of height and weight is also of very little value due to similar reasons. As a result, a number of methods have been developed which aid us in our estimation of the maturity of a child and allow us the opportunity to see if they are behind or ahead of their growth and development towards becoming an adult.",

By considering the trade-offs between using one's resources for reproduction versus other tasks, the evolutionary framework of life history theory predicts that reproductive timing should be influenced by mortality and resource scarcity. A series of experiments examined how mortality cues influenced the desire to have children sooner rather than later. The effects of mortality depended critically on whether people grew up in a relatively resource-scarce or resource-plentiful environment. For individuals growing up relatively poor, mortality cues produced a desire to reproduce sooner--to want children now, even at the cost of furthering one's education or career. Conversely, for individuals growing up relatively wealthy, mortality cues produced a desire to delay reproduction--to further one's education or career before starting a family. Overall, mortality cues appear to shift individuals into different life history strategies as a function of childhood socioeconomic status, suggesting important implications for how environmental factors can influence fertility and family size.",

Instead of striving for fair-play and sport excellence which not exclude justness, solidarity and moral integrity, contemporary sport frequently follows the Lombardian ethic, where \"winning isn't everything, it's the only thing\". Moral pause or bracketed morality, as described in sport, refers to the phenomenon of tolerance and acceptance of aggressive behavior or cheating, that will be morally condemned outside sports arenas. Accordingly, lower levels of moral reasoning and behavior have been identified in athletes and non-athletes in the sports-related situation in comparison to other life situations; in athletes when compared to non-athletes, in more experienced athletes, high-level athletes, team-sport athletes, and male athletes. Moral reasoning and behavior of athletes are influenced by contextual and personal factors, with coaches having a particularly important role to play. The positive influence of sport on the moral development of athletes might be related to pre-service and in-service education of coaches how to develop adequate moral atmosphere, and how to plan for moral decision-making as an integral part of everyday practice.",

Four main parenting styles, investigated so far, which evoke researchers interest most frequently, are: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive (liberal) loving and permissive uninvolved style. Research conducted in different countries has allowed us to describe connections between applying particular upbringing models and the occurrence of depression, eating disorders, addictions or violence. It has been evidenced that liberal- unloving parenting style, based on little control, and lack of emotional support, is positively associated with aggressive behavior. Parenting models based on excessive control and emotional coldness increase the risk of depression and substance abuse in children and adolescent, whereas authoritative parenting style applied by both parents minimalizes the risk of depression, suicidal tendencies and is also negatively correlated with substance abuse, bulimia and anorexia nervosa. Scientific reports indicate cross-cultural differences in young people’s perception of their parent’s style. For example, uninvolved parenting style was associated with higher depressiveness in Asian females than in African-American. Our paper presents a review of investigations on parenting styles and their results, conducted in different times and often in different cultures. The presented data allows us to formulate general conclusions and recommendations concerning parenting methods which may minimize the risk of psychopathology in youth. Authoritative style, consisting in high control combined with expression of emotional warmth, seems to be the most advantageous for the child’s development.",

Men are affected by OS as it damages seminal characteristics including survival that appearance as well as inhibits sperm functioning. Still, not every research has reached identical findings.

The risk of experiencing this distress, however, is not equally distributed across members of all racial groups. African American girls are generally more satisfied with their bodies and thus may be less vulnerable to experiencing depression as a result of weight concerns. Several scholars have suggested that membership in African American culture provides social resources that protect Black females from experiencing high levels of weight-based psychological distress. The authors examine the relationship between body size and depression and the potentially moderating role of African American culture using data from the Family and Community Health Study. Assessing a cohort of 343 African American girls ages 12 to 14, the authors found support for a link between weight and depression. There was no evidence that exposure to African American culture moderated this relationship.",

Aunque es evidente que la relacion entre la satisfaccion de necesidades materiales es condicion para el surgimiento y desarrollo de las necesidades y capacidades subjetivas, no parece estar todo dicho sobre la forma en que un funcionamiento psicologico optimo depende de funcionamientos socio-economicos basicos. Este estudio parte del supuesto de que los fenomenos que remiten al bienestar subjetivo y al bienestar economico-material se vinculan, pero no necesariamente se explican ni determinan mutuamente. El 18,7% de la poblacion presenta algun tipo de sintomatologia ansiosa o depresiva, el 18,2% se siente poco satisfecho con su vida y casi 1 de cada 3 se siente poco o nada feliz. En relacion con los recursos cognitivos, el 23,7% de la poblacion manifiesta afrontamiento negativo, mientras que el 11% presenta creencia de control externo. La condicion de pobreza afecta las probabilidades de experimentar una situacion deficitaria para todos los indicadores seleccionados. Ser pobre por ingresos o indigente incrementa de manera notoria las posibilidades de padecer malestar psicologico, experimentar poca satisfaccion con la vida, sentirse poco o nada feliz, asi como tambien la probabilidad de afrontamiento negativo o creencia de control externo. Entre los individuos en hogares con al menos una carencia relativa a derechos sociales o economicos, se duplica la proporcion de poblacion con sintomatologia ansiosa y depresiva, en comparacion a aquellos que no evidencian ninguna carencia en los derechos sociales y economicos seleccionados. A medida que se incrementa la cantidad de carencias observadas en dimensiones de derechos sociales, la incidencia del malestar psicologico se incrementa. Si bien con distintas proporciones segun el indicador considerado, la presencia de carencias en alguna dimension y la cantidad de estas contribuyen a incrementar de manera importante las probabilidades de experimentar deficit para los indicadores observados. Con diferencias en las proporciones, se percibe para todos los indicadores una incidencia menor para los que no son pobres ni vulnerables por carencias. A excepcion de la experiencia de sentirse poco o nada feliz, se observan ademas niveles diferenciales de deficit para los distintos indicadores segun las categorias de la matriz. Las situaciones de pobreza multidimensional, que son las que presentan de manera simultanea carencias en terminos de ingresos como de derechos multiplican las chances de presentar algun aspecto de malestar subjetivo. Esto se incrementa aun mas para los casos que presentan pobreza multidimensional extrema.",

      "title": "Manly Meat and Gendered Eating: Correcting Imbalance and Seeking Virtue",
      "abstract": "Eating is a gendered act. In Western cultural mythology, men have rapacious \nappetites that cannot be easily satisfied; they require ‘substantial’ foods (like meat \nand potatoes) to keep up their strength and satisfy their hunger. 1 Hearty consumption demonstrates a man’s virility and reinforces his masculinity. Women, \non the other hand, have appetites that can easily be satisfied with low-calorie, \nlow-fat foods (like fruits, vegetables, and diet drinks); according to popular cultural myths, they live in constant danger of weight gain and loss of attractiveness \nif they indulge these minimal appetites. Furthermore, while men are encouraged to indulge and take pride in their appetites-whether it be for food, sex, or \npower-women are taught to tightly repress their hunger, focusing instead on \nsatisfying the appetites of others. 2Food is also frequently gendered. 3 Meat, in particular, is construed as ‘male’ \nfood, with nonfat yogurt, meatless salads, and other ‘light’ fare cast as ‘female.’ 4\nSo strong is the connection of meat with men and male power, in fact, that feminist theorist Carol Adams calls meat the symbol of the patriarchy and argues that \nthe struggle to overcome male oppression must include moving away from eating meat. “How [can] we overthrow patriarchal power while eating its symbol?” \nshe asks. “Autonomous, antipatriarchal being is clearly vegetarian. To destabilize \npatriarchal consumption we must interrupt patriarchal meals of meat” (200). 5\nAdams is hardly alone in taking this stance: Other prominent feminists such as \nGreta Gaard, Lori Gruen, Marti Kheel, and Catharine MacKinnon also argue \nthat rejecting the consumption of animals and animal products is an important step in overcoming patriarchal structures and consequent environmental \ninjustices. 6The ecofeminist argument for veganism is powerful. Meat consumption is \na deeply gendered act that is closely tied to the systematic objectification ofwomen and nonhuman animals. Nevertheless, I have concerns about advocating veganism that involve its effectiveness in destabilizing patriarchal injustices. \nIn particular, I am concerned that presenting veganism as the moral ideal might \nreinforce rather than alleviate the disordered status quo in gendered eating-that \nit might actually further disadvantage women in existing power structures. In \nthis chapter, I explain these concerns, and I advocate a feminist account of ethical eating that treats dietary choices as moral choices insofar as they constitute \nan integral part of our relationships to ourselves and to others. 7 I argue that we \nshould think of dietary choices in Aristotelian moral terms as a mean relative to \nus , falling on a continuum between the vice of doing injustice to ourselves, on \nthe one hand, and the vice of doing injustice to others, on the other. On this \nview, what it is moral to eat for individuals is not a fixed ideal, but rather depends \non particulars of our physiological, psychological, economic, cultural, and relational situations.",

However, many of these studies have not accounted for the sexual identification of the participants sampled and have been limited in their conceptualization of religiosity. The religious context may be a source of conflict for some sexual minority individuals. As such, additional research is needed to examine the relationship between sexual minority religiosity and mental health. One-hundred and six sexual minority young adults (ages 18–24) were surveyed to examine the relationship between a multidimensional understanding of religiosity and sexual orientation conflict, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. While behavioral religiosity was generally not related to mental health outcomes, affective and cognitive measures of religiosity indicate both risk and protective benefit.

      "abstract": "In countries such as the USA, a substantial percentage of teenage pregnancies are intentional, and desire for pregnancy increases risk. Black US Americans have been found to be less accepting of homosexuality than their non-Black peers, which may result in minority ethnic teenagers demonstrating heterosexual orientation through attempting pregnancy. Young, socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans were surveyed longitudinally regarding attitudes about their sexuality, pregnancy intentions and other psychosocial factors. Young people who reported being somewhat concerned about their sexual orientation were nearly four times more likely to report attempting pregnancy compared to those who were not at all concerned. This relationship held true while accounting for the significant effect of religion, sense of community, hopelessness and numerous demographic factors. The current study suggests that uncertainty regarding sexual orientation, potentially due to social stigma, may impact pregnancy attempts among young Black people from disadvantaged communities.",

La adquisicion de un buena postura, crear intereses de forma externa de los movimientos, pueden ser algunos ejemplos. Algunos cientificos han planteado que el organismo humano pudiera alcanzar los120 anos, hasta hoy la tan buscada fuente de la juventud desde tiempos inmemoriales no aparecio y ningun cientifico ha podido encontrar ningun medicamento capaz de devolverla; por tanto, se han dedicado, logicamente, a mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas de edad avanzada mediante el ejercicio fisico como forma natural de lograrlo. En la vejez se comienza a disminuir normal y progresivamente la cantidad de celulas que conforman los diferentes tejidos, a partir de los 35, 40 anos, como norma, comienzan a morir mas celulas que las que se crean pues no reciben la oxigenacion necesaria. La actividad deportivo recreativa es una forma de llenar el tiempo libre de quienes lo poseen, no adopta caracteristicas discriminatorias en sus diversas manifestaciones, ni menos aun, es una mercancia que se ofrece a quien mejor pueda pagarla, muy por el contrario, ella se constituye en una actividad basica en el objetivo de desarrollo armonico e integral del hombre y de la sociedad en su conjunto.

Las actividades deportivas recreativas, con un marcado interes por promover el contacto social alegre, se encuentran tambien, en el rango de una escala social de valores relevantes, al igual que las formas dirigidas al aumento de los rendimientos.

People with gender identity disorder may act and present themselves as members of the opposite sex and may express a desire to alter their bodies. The disorder affects an individual's self-image, and can impact the person's mannerisms and behavior.\r\nAs gender identity develops in children, with sex-role assignment. Sex role-stereotypes are the beliefs, characteristics and behaviors of individual cultures that are considered normal and appropriate for boys and girls to possess. These norms are influenced by ones family and friends, the mass-media, and their community. Since many cultures strongly disapprove of cross-gender behavior, it often results in significant problems for affected persons and those in close relationships with them. In many cases, discomfort is also reported as stemming from the feeling that one's body is wrong or meant to be different.\r\nThe need for treatment is emphasized by the high rate of mental health problems, including Depression with higher suicide rate among untreated transsexual people than in the general population.\r\nThese problems are not usually related to the gender identity issues themselves, but the social and cultural responses to gender-deviated individuals.\r\nAn example which classically illustrates GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER is the case of a young man from Brunei Darussalam, who was seen and treated.

This study extends prior research by using a life course perspective, panel data from the Health and Retirement Study, and multilevel growth curve models to investigate racial-ethnic differences in the trajectories of serious conditions and functional limitations among blacks, Mexican Americans, and whites. We test three hypotheses on the nature of racial-ethnic disparities in health across the life course (aging-as-leveler, persistent inequality, and cumulative disadvantage). Results controlling for mortality selection reveal that support for the hypotheses varies by health outcome, racial-ethnic group, and life stage. Controlling for childhood socioeconomic status, adult social and economic resources, and health behaviors reduces but does not eliminate racial-ethnic disparities in health trajectories.",

Sexual dysfunctions which impair coital ability, especially ejaculatory difficulties in the male and genital atrophy and loss of vaginal lubrication in the female, are frequent. Menopausal couples are often not knowledgeable about physiologic aging changes that affect sexual performance and are reluctant to communicate sexual difficulties to their partner. Without professional counseling and/or pharmacologic intervention, these conditions may lead to sexual frustration and abstinence.

      "title": "Tall Stature",
      "abstract": "Tall stature is rarely pathologic, but the pediatric health care clinician must be able to distinguish familial causes from those due to endocrine or genetic reasons. Defined as a height 2 SDs above the mean for age and sex or greater than the 95th percentile, tall stature is usually familial or secondary to obesity. Although there is known psychological stigma associated with short stature, the paucity of evidence that tall stature in females or males is psychologically detrimental makes the previous practice of sex hormone administration to decrease ultimate adult height no longer acceptable.When evaluating tall stature, it is first necessary to plot serial height measurements during multiple visits. If these measurements confirm the criteria for tall stature, the clinician should calculate the child's projected adult height by calculating the midparental height as follows:Parental heights should be measured directly because self-reported heights are often overestimated, especially in men. If a child has at least one tall parent and plots within 5 cm of the target adult height range, he/she is considered to have familial, or constitutional, tall stature. In this circumstance, no further investigation is warranted as long as the child is developing normally and has normal physical examination findings. Measurement of body proportions is also important, including upper body to lower body ratios and arm span, because these measures can help differentiate between pathologic and familial tall stature. At birth, the upper extremity to lower extremity ratio should be 1.7. By early childhood, this proportion should be 0.89 to 0.95. In addition, a child's arm span is generally 1 cm shorter than his height, whereas an adolescent's arm span is generally equal to his height. Klinefelter syndrome should be considered in a patient with tall stature, increased arm span, sparse hair, small testes, and a high-pitched voice, predicating the need for karyotype testing. A tall patient with decreased upper to lower body segment ratio, hyperextensible joints, and scoliosis may have Marfan syndrome.If pathologic tall stature is suspected, a bone age radiograph of left hand, fingers, and wrist should be ordered. A normal bone age is consistent with familial tall stature, whereas accelerated bone age in a nonobese child must lead the pediatrician to consider precocious puberty or growth hormone excess. Obesity leads to tall stature in childhood with a normal final adult height and is associated with accelerated skeletal maturation. Although the exact mechanism for obesity's role in tall stature is not understood, the hormone ghrelin, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, insulin-like growth factors, and insulin all have the potential to mediate linear growth.In conjunction with bone age, precocious puberty can be diagnosed with Tanner staging and assessing testicular volume in males, with a postpubertal testicular volume being greater than 4 mL. Patients with late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia present with precocious puberty, tall stature, and an increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone level in the blood. Growth hormone excess is rare in children, yet when present is usually due to pituitary adenomas. Growth hormone excess before epiphyseal fusion results in tall stature and markedly increased height velocity. If it occurs after epiphyseal fusion, adolescents may also have signs of acromegaly, such as coarsening of facial features, enlarged jaw, and distal body overgrowth, including large hands and feet.There are other rare genetic syndromes associated with tall stature, all of which have significant clinical stigmata that should be apparent on physical examination. Sotos syndrome should be considered if the bone age is accelerated and the child has accompanying symptoms of facial flushing, frontal bossing, and a narrow face and head. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is considered if hypoglycemia is present at birth, along with anterior abdominal wall defects and macroglossia. Marshall-Smith syndrome is associated with unusually rapid physical growth, abnormal facies, and respiratory issues.A pediatric health care professional can diagnose most causes of tall stature with a careful history and physical examination. If suspicion is high for disease or the cause is unclear, the clinician should consider radiographic bone age and focused laboratory testing. Although the social stigma behind tall stature has decreased, clinicians must still be aware of potential pathologic causes of tall stature that would warrant intervention.Comments: This In Brief emphasizes the importance of accurate height measurements. My experience is that height measurement can often be inaccurate, especially in supine measurements in young children or very active children who have difficulty standing still. When transitioning from supine measurements to standing measurements in toddlers, there may appear to be a false perception of a decrease in height because standing height is often shorter than supine length. Accurate measurement of upper to lower body segment ratios is important in identifying several syndromes and can be performed in the following way. To measure lower body segment, measure from the symphysis pubis of the patient to the floor. The upper segment can be calculated by subtracting the lower segment from the total height. Measurement of arm span is best accomplished by measuring from the tip of the middle finger of one hand, with arms outstretched at a 90° angle to the tip of the middle finger of the other hand.A recent study of self-reported adult height measurements in parents found that men have a tendency to overestimate their heights but women's self-report is more accurate. When looking at estimating the other parent's height, women were more likely to overestimate the men's height, whereas men were more accurate in estimating women's height. Their conclusions were that attempts should be made to use measured heights of parents when the results would have an effect on diagnostic workup or treatment of patients with tall stature.",

Although puberty presents challenges for all adolescents, girls who mature early are particularly vulnerable. Early pubertal timing in girls has been reported to be associated with increased prevalence and severity of psychopathology through late adolescence1. However, very few studies have focused on the long term impact of earlier development. This study suggests that girls who experienced earlier menarche continued to show higher rates of depressive symptoms and antisocial behaviors in early-to-middle adulthood even after accounting for demographic and contextual variables commonly associated with vulnerability for mental health. A challenge for future researchers is to specify the cognitive, social, neural, and biological mechanisms that mediate this continued risk and hopefully reverse them.",

(In the United States, people with disabilities make up the population's largest minority: Census 2000 found nearly twenty percent of the population over five years of age to be affected by some sort of disability [United States, Census Bureau].) Furthermore, because of the way this minority is constituted, it is arguably more diverse than those of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation.

Genetic drift causes its most dramatic and rapid changes in small populations. The chapter consider some examples of founder and bottleneck effects. Disassortative mating can strongly interact with drift-induced linkage disequilibrium, particularly after founder or bottleneck effects. Finite population size has many important evolutionary consequences: increasing the average amount of identity-by-descent, increasing the variance of allele frequencies through time and across populations, causing the loss or fixation of alleles, and generating linkage disequilibrium. Genetic drift causes random deviations from the allele frequency of the previous generation. The variance effective size measures how rapidly allele frequencies are likely to change and/or how rapidly isolated subpopulations diverge from one another under genetic drift.",

      "title": "Physiology of Aging",
      "abstract": "With aging, there is an apparent depletion of physiologic reserves that has been termed homeostenosis. When the reserves are depleted, the older adult is intolerant of further challenges without crossing a precipice, that is, frailty. However, in the absence of a challenge, many of the age-related changes are not clinically apparent. The reserves are, in part, in use just to maintain homeostasis, and studies that measure how much they are in use, allostatic load, can predict age-associated outcomes. Inflammation at low levels and associated with age may be a driver of many of these processes. Because aging is experienced in diverse fashion, the heterogeneity of older adults is great and the differences between the aging of men and women are being increasingly recognized. Similarly, the heterogeneity in the loss of reserves among older adults contributes to their nonspecific presentations on illness. Understanding the fundamental age-related changes allows us to appreciate the unique population that older adults create.",

      "title": "Toward a Definition of “Hypersexuality” in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Recent psychiatric literature has used the term \"hypersexuality\" to denote pathologically increased sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Various patterns of increased sexuality have been described in youth, including sexuality that is excessive, developmentally precocious, compulsive, aggressive, or otherwise socially inappropriate. Such \"hypersexual\" behavior in children and adolescents is associated with a variety of factors. Social factors include sexual abuse, physical abuse, life stress, and impaired family relationships. Psychiatric factors include emotional and behavioral problems in general, posttraumatic stress disorder and dissociative symptoms in particular, and possibly bipolar disorder. Despite the importance of increased sexual behavior in youth as a possible sign of these problems, there is currently no uniform definition in psychiatric literature of the term \"hypersexuality\" applied to children and adolescents. The usefulness of this term depends upon the degree to which it can be defined, measured, and distinguished from non-pathological juvenile sexual behavior. Research instruments are described that may be useful in measuring levels of sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Elements of a definition of juvenile hypersexuality are proposed based upon current knowledge about children and adolescents' sexuality in both normal development and a variety of conditions in which it is increased. Care is warranted in distinguishing between normal and abnormal sexual behavior in youth because of the variety of factors that can affect its measurement.",

      "abstract": "In comparatively gender equal Norway, most boys and girls participate in sports at about equal rates. This apparent gender equality is investigated further: do young teens also profess equal ambitions of becoming professional athletes? Drawing on 81 interviews with 12- and 13-year-olds, the study suggest that the boys and girls make similar investments in sports, but there are clear gender differences in the ways they describe their future ambitions. The majority of the boys talk about wanting to become professional athletes and going 'all in', but very few of the girls do – the ambitious girls rather talk about skills development. The paper argues that cultural narratives thus shape young people's self-understanding and ambitions, both boys and girls may suffer consequences of this: in a sports-internal logic, the girls may be given limited practical possibilities, resources and support – but boys may risk regret, disappointment and wasting time and resources.",

Whilst considerable attention has been paid to the neurocognitive processes contributing to anomalous perceptions amongst older adults, less is known about the social factors (e.g. social isolation, loneliness). Furthermore, it is unknown whether loneliness and social isolation are associated with different types of anomalous perceptions, including anomalous body-centred self-experiences and anomalous external experiences.This study examined the cross-sectional relationships between loneliness, objective social isolation, and anomalous perceptions in a sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 242, Mage = 71.87 ± 7.73, range = 52-91, 67.8% female) using structural equation modelling.Higher levels of loneliness were associated with more anomalous body-centred self-experiences and anomalous external experiences. Those reporting more loneliness also reported higher levels of anxiety and depression; however, the relationship between loneliness and anomalous perceptions was not mediated by these factors. Social disconnection from a religious group was associated with more anomalous external experiences and being married/living with a partner was associated with more anomalous body-centred self-experiences.These findings suggest that loneliness and social isolation have differential associations with anomalous perceptions in older adults and provide additional evidence that attending to loneliness in older adults is important.",

Neuroimaging studies have highlighted several potential mechanisms underlying an individual's propensity to become obese, including sex/gender differences. Obesity has been associated with structural, functional, and chemical alterations throughout the brain. Whereas changes in somatosensory regions appear to be associated with obesity in men, reward regions appear to have greater involvement in obesity among women than men. Sex/gender differences have also been observed in the neural response to taste among people with obesity. A more thorough understanding of these neural and behavioral differences will allow for more tailored interventions, including diet suggestions, for the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

We argue that this ambiguates between two different theses, the Strict and the Lax. On the Strict Reading of the thesis, procreation and eco‐gluttony are both wrong for the same reasons, that is, because both involve individuals overstepping their carbon budget. We argue that this is false at least with regard to a certain number of children and a range of the costs of children. By contrast, a Lax Reading of the thesis is, we think, defensible. On this reading, procreation and eco‐gluttony may both be wrong, but for different reasons and under different conditions. While eco‐gluttony is wrong across a range of ideal and non‐ideal conditions because it is a failure to live within one's fair carbon budget, having a child is only wrong, if it is wrong, under non‐ideal conditions where prospective parents have weighty reasons, or an obligation, to pick up the moral slack of others.",

Conversely, adult interest in sex tended to be lowest when neither masturbation nor sex with a partner had occurred prior to 18 years of age.

The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour: older people's repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

For our own species, unlike pigs, sheep, and cattle, carcass weight and even athletic prowess are considerably less important than achieving our full intellectual potential. Undernutrition has for too long been considered in adult terms as a series of deficiency diseases whose main consequences can be reversed on restoration of the deficient component. In pediatrics, we must now be much more concerned about undernutrition at certain vulnerable stages of development having long-term sequelae which may be irreversible in spite of the most strenuous",

Often such people are becoming high-ranking and accepted in social circles. Despite the advantages that through this disorder can sometimes present, shortcomings are reflected as distinct detachment from the environment, the impossibility of establishing a healthy and lasting relationships. Narcissists are emotionally unavailable, unable to achieve stable love relationships. In case of more conspicuous pathology, problems may exist at the level of socially accepted norms, moral and law so the damage can affect the broader framework of society.",

People enter initial interactions with a considerable lack of information about their communication partner. Whether partners seek further interaction and develop their relationship depends on their ability to communicate effectively despite this uncertainty and in ways that decrease this uncertainty. As relationships escalate, partners continue to gather and provide information that alleviates uncertainty as they assess the viability and desirability of further relationship escalation. Uncertainty persists within mutually committed relationships, contributing to dialectical tensions and manifesting as questions about a person's own interest in the relationship, the partner's involvement in the association, and the nature of the relationship in general. Because uncertainty can arise whenever conditions within and surrounding a relationship change and because uncertainty complicates interpersonal communication, it influences the development and maintenance of intimacy across the relational lifespan.",

The current article uses the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to assess the degree to which internalised ageism is related to one’s preferred retirement age. For internalised ageism, assessments are made about the degree to which individuals consider themselves to be old; they agree that their age prevents them from undertaking activities; they are pessimistic about their own future health and that being old comes with deteriorating health more generally. Results show that health pessimism especially affects one’s preferred retirement age negatively, even when controlling for current health and other factors, and mainly for middle-educated women. Implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "It seems that no matter where we look, stress exerts strong effects on the physiology and psychophysiology of an organism. Although beneﬁcial in the short run it is not surprising that long term stress can disturb the natural equilibrium state of an animal, given it’ s effects on the extended range of pararameters (systemic, endocrinological, cellular, molecular. The most interesting observation however was that females consistently showed an opposite or different effect than males. With regard to the question of which sex is more or less susceptible to stress, it appears this answer is thus less clear-cut than we would hope. While stress seems to affect transcriptional activity and cellular signal transduction in males, females appear more vulnerable to the negative stress effects on cell birth and/or survival. The manner in which HPA axis activity is affected in males and females is a testimony to this gender-differential regulation, since both sexes seem to indicate prolonged HPA axis overactivity, albeit in a sex-speciﬁc manner. The question we should therefore focus on is not which sex is more vulnerable, but how do the sexes differ in their vulnerabilities. It is more insight into this matter that may ultimately lead to way to new and improved drug development that considers sex speciﬁc neural circuits implicated in stress response regulation. Perhaps one day we can even speak of customized drug design, targeted to meet gender speciﬁc disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Self-esteem has been regarded as one of the most pivotal component in almost every day human daily activities. Trajectory of self esteem development means that on the average, one’s self-esteem is relatively high in childhood, then drops during adolescence, later to arise gradually throughout adulthood, and then declines sharply in old age. The purpose of this research is to study the trajectory of self-esteem development in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood during their developmental stages. The research had been conducted on 150 respondents, in which 63 males and 87 females participated in this study. Cross-sectional design and convenience sampling had been selected for the above proposed study. However, the findings of this research shows a gradual increase of one’s self-esteem in old age which is in sharp contradiction to the present trajectory indicating that self esteem declines significantly during old age as stated in literature reviews of earlier researchers, but holds the same views on childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Despite the general developmental age differences across the human lifespan, an individual tends to maintain his/her ordering relative to one another; whereby individuals who have relatively high self-esteem at one point in time tend to have relatively high self-esteem years later on.",

      "abstract": "In Senegal, adolescents live in a socioeconomic climate that is between traditional society with its well-structured rites and customs and an extroverted modern society. They are often plunged into uncertainty and into a search of themselves. With a weak and not-yet-determined personality, sexuality erupts into their life experience. In Senegal, adolescent fertility, once encouraged by tradition, has become a social phenomenon which challenges all those interested in problems of youth. Major risks throughout the pregnancy and the puerperium confront adolescents. Complications may include grave vomiting, preeclampsia, hypertension and hemorrhaging, and more severe malaria than normal due to pregnancy. 12.9% of adolescent pregnancies end in miscarriage, 5.8% in premature births. Low birth weight and fetal death are also risk factors of adolescent pregnancy. Incomplete physical development exacerbates childbirth among adolescents, often leading to cesarean section, infection, and hemorrhaging. A combination of several risks appearing unexpectedly during pregnancy and during and after delivery can lead to a tragic death. During 1988-1989 at the gynecologic-obstetric clinic of the Aristide Le Dantac University Hospital Center of Dakar, adolescents comprised 8.1% of maternal deaths. If adolescents survive pregnancy, they may suffer after effects, e.g., genital scar tissue or psychological disorders. Infertility can also be an after effect. An unwanted pregnancy ended by illegal induced abortion can also lead to infertility. 2% of adolescents attending the clinic have common infections and/or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). These infections almost always are a result of poor hygiene of the genital region. Family life education should prepare adolescents for sexuality and contraceptive use. Barrier methods can best prevent STDs and AIDS. Other contraceptive methods require compliance with strict rules. Emergency contraception should be reserved for cases of rape or incest. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies is the best means to prevent infanticide which is relatively common among youth leaving rural areas.",

This article looks at the self-concept and self-evaluation of men and women over the adult life course, using data from a large national probability sample. The evidence indicates that as persons age their self-concepts, while not qualitatively different from that of younger persons, contain more positive attributes, fewer negative attributes, and become better integrated. Age is also associated with a positive self-evaluation, as indicated by life satisfaction, self-esteem, and an index of meaninglessness. Ther are some odest gender differences in these age relationships, but, overall, males and females appear to experience aging in similar ways. The general impression is that as persons age they become increasingly comfortable with themselves and their situation. Because it is unlikely that these relationships are due primarily to cohort, period, or compositional effects, the article concludes that the data support a maturational perspective.",

But how universal are these patterns? Most of the literature on human mating patterns is based on post-industrial societies. Much less is known about mating behaviour in more traditional societies. Here we investigate mate choice by analysing whether there is any evidence for non-random mating with respect to size and strength in a forager community, the Hadza of Tanzania. We test whether couples assort for height, weight, body mass index (BMI), per cent fat and grip strength. We test whether there is a male-taller norm. Finally, we test for an association between anthropometric variables and number of marriages. Our results show no evidence for assortative mating for height, weight, BMI or per cent fat; no evidence for a male-taller norm and no evidence that number of marriages is associated with our size variables. Hadza couples may assort positively for grip strength, but grip strength does not affect the number of marriages. Overall we conclude that, in contrast to post-industrial societies, mating appears to be random with respect to size in the Hadza.",

Here, we investigated the effect of male age and previous sexual experience on mating success and female fitness in the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae). Males were either young or old, sexually experienced or naïve. Older and sexually experienced males obtained more copulations. However, females did not receive benefits in terms of lifetime fecundity, fertility, or longevity from mating with these males. Results suggest that males become more competitive as they age and gain sexual experience and may be able to maintain a high quality ejaculate compared to young males. Older experienced males may be manipulating females into preferentially mating with them at no benefit to females. Alternatively, females may prefer mating with older more experienced males and possibly receive other indirect benefits, but this remains to be tested.",

Between the ages of 18 and 24, 179 women had regularly experienced orgasm, but 37 had not. At the age of 25-60, 186 women had experienced orgasm, and 27 had not. We used the method of sampling experiences. The women noted the signs consistent with their usual experiences during “normal” intercourse. It has been established that the appearance of an orgasm before 25 years of age strengthens and reinforces psychological satisfaction, inner comfort, meeting expectations, sexual interest, intensity of reaction and acceptance of what is happening, weakens dysphoria and shame. At the age of over 25 years, appearance of an orgasm maximally stimulates sexual interest, intensity of response, acceptance of what is happening, sharpness of perception, reduces shame and weakens physical discomfort more strongly. The absence of an orgasm before the age of 25 does not have a bright negative effect. After 25 years, this, first of all, leads to a decrease in sexual interest and mood, increased shame, guilt, hopelessness, and disruption of interpersonal interaction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Commentary on Asperger's Syndrome both within and outside of the neurodiversity movement relies heavily on the dichotomy between the socially skilled neurotypical or normal mind and the socially inept, but possibly brilliant, autistic other, who is usually male. These discourses often position neurotypicals—particularly neurotypical women—as an oppressive social force that hinders the individuality of men with Asperger's Syndrome as they impose compulsory sociality—the normative behavior associated with ‘social skills’ or the ability to understand and conform to the dominant behaviors and attitudes. At the same time, many women who have been diagnosed with high-functioning autism also regard neurotypical women as arbiters of conformity who gain cultural authority by imposing dominant norms and values. The popular construction of the neurotypical woman is based on long-standing gender stereotypes rooted in post-war discourses about normative femininity. More recently, difference feminism has revived these generalizations by suggesting that women think and act according to a feminine epistemology based on feeling rather than reason. Both the neurodiversity movement and the larger cultural mainstream continue to promote retrograde forms of female power based on a distortion of the empathetic and relational qualities commonly associated with women.",

The realization of such a network of relationships is of crucial importance for alleviating loneliness. Loneliness concerns a situation in which the number of meaningful, lasting, interpersonal relationships is experienced by the person as deficient, either qualitatively or quantitatively, and as less than satisfying in meeting the person's desires. Intimacy scores were higher for respondents who mentioned a partner as most confidant relationship than for respondents who mentioned either a friend or a close relative. People living without a partner, whose most confidant relationship has little or no intimacy, and who express the desire for new relationships can, as a consequence, be characterized as people with a high probability of loneliness. A confidant relationship with little intimacy was related to greater occurrence of loneliness.",

      "abstract": "F or the chronic pain sufferer, sexual expression may become distorted, inhibited, sublimated, alienated, demanding or fearful-patterns frequently seen in people who view sexual activity as a duty or a means of procreation. The idea that sexual activity will cause, precipitate, or aggravate the pain may yield reluctance to participate, thus further anxiety and depression, which can diminish sexual function. Yet the human need and desire for sexual warmth is not negated by pain. Sexuality does not stop when pain strikes, it merely changes. Some form of sexual expression is possible for, and the right of any, regardless of disability, according to Weinberg(1). Although illnesses and surgical procedures may produce sexual difficulties, none have more devastating effects than diseases of the neuromuscular system(2). Any impairment of parasympathetic nerve activity, or loss of muscular and/or skeletal movement-such as with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis-can involve sexual dysfunction. The most difficult position for people with restrictive movement is the one most frequently used for intercourse. Although the male-on-top position allows good vocal and visual communication, a female with arthritis may be unable to abduct and rotate her hips for the supine position(3). Alternative sidelying and rear-entry positions may be less strenuous and may ease the partner's fear of causing pain. Major tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, and narcotics are a major part of some pain treatments but a diminished libido and potency are common side effects. Patients need to be informed about these effects and should be helped in timing their doses.

      "title": "Percepção da mulher sobre sexualidade após o envelhecimento",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A sexualidade da mulher nao termina com o envelhecimento, e os avancos na educacao e na saude podem mudar a manutencao e a expectativa de vida sexual das idosas. Sabe-se que ha ainda uma falta de abertura social para abordar o tema, e a maioria das idosas se sentem reprimidas e constrangidas por nao falar de desejos, que diante de uma sociedade carregada de preconceitos, tabus e dogmas. Assim, a discussao sobe a sexualidade inclui um repensar constante dessa pratica, para que essas questoes possam ser abordadas pela sociedade, sem reduzi-las aos aspectos biologicos, buscando abranger as percepcoes do corpo, do prazer e desprazer, entre outros aspectos e valores emergentes relativos a sexualidade na contemporaneidade. Diante disso, este estudo objetivou conhecer a percepcao da mulher idosa sobre sexualidade. Desenvolvimento: sabe-se que alguns fatores influenciam diretamente como a mulher idosa vivencia a sua sexualidade, como a falta de informacao, a vergonha, o preconceito, sobretudo delas mesmas em relacao a sua idade. Nesse sentido, tratou-se de um estudo qualitativo descritivo, no qual foram entrevistadas 50 mulheres idosas no interior da Bahia, e foi realizada a analise de conteudo das entrevistas. A coleta de dados foi realizada com base no cadastro das 15 Unidades de Saude da Familia (USF) do municipio. Primeiramente, foi realizado o levantamento aleatorio da localizacao das idosas em cada area de adscricao, em parceria com a USF, para posteriormente a mesma ser abordada em sua residencia. A tecnica de coleta de dados foi a entrevista direta com utilizacao de um roteiro nao estruturado, composto por duas questoes norteadoras, que abordaram a percepcao da idosa sobre sexualidade. Os dados foram coletados no periodo de marco a junho do ano 2016, sendo que, cada entrevista, durou em media 40 minutos. Todas as entrevistas foram gravadas mediante a autorizacao da participante, para posterior transcricao, assegurado quanto a confiabilidade e privacidade dos dados pessoais obtidos. O tratamento dos dados foi realizado a partir da tecnica de analise do conteudo, seguindo as etapas descritas por Bardin (2011) e Minayo (2007), e foi dividido em tres fases: ordenacao dos dados: na qual o material empirico coletado (documentos e transcricoes das entrevistas) foi organizado, com a identificacao das idosas por numero e a transcricao dos audios na integra; classificacao dos dados e analise propriamente dita. A amostra foi de 50, por conveniencia, contudo a saturacao das respostas ocorreu com 39 idosas. Resultados: As idosas, por terem uma vulnerabilidade pregressa diante de um cenario de tantos afazeres em sua juventude, na qual eram majoritariamente donas de casa, responsaveis por trabalhar, cuidar de filhos e ainda dispor do seu tempo para o marido, vivem hoje das consequencias desses fatores. Muitas vezes a realidade diverge do almejado desejo de querer se cuidar, de realizar atividades divertidas e sair da rotina, pois a falta de tempo e de entusiasmo com a vida e consigo mesma e o que caracteriza e concretiza alguns tabus de que idosa nao pode ter uma vida similar a da sua juventude. As idosas mostraram uma associacao da sexualidade ao ato sexual, como algo que so pode ocorrer apos o casamento, sentindo-se reprimidas pelo medo das criticas e dos julgamentos. Relataram ainda a falta de assistencia dos profissionais da saude sobre o tema, e com isso observou-se a fragilidade da confianca e do vinculo entre paciente e profissionais, devido aos dogmas instituidos pelo tema. Notou-se que mudancas devem ser pensadas sobre a assistencia prestada a respeito da sexualidade, podendo ser planejadas estrategias para lidar melhor com esse publico usando sugestoes dadas pelas mesmas, como a formacao de grupos de discussao sobre saude sexual no envelhecimento. Esse estudo abre caminhos e deixa perguntas a serem respondidas por novas pesquisas, sabemos o que a idosa pensa sobre sua sexualidade, mas como as pessoas enxergam a sexualidade da mulher idosa? Ao falarem da falta de assistencia por parte dos profissionais de saude, levantam um questionamento importante, pois e justamente neste contexto que a dificuldade e retratada, por nao terem uma assistencia adequada para cuidar da propria saude, ocultada pela objecao ao assunto. Sendo assim, uma atencao especifica voltada para os aspectos fisicos e socioculturais, que estao ligados a sexualidade, podem ser um sanador de varias dificuldades vivenciadas por elas. E importante relatar que a sexualidade e o corpo estao intrinsecamente ligados ao cuidado como pratica social de vivenciar essa fase, por serem os profissionais que cuidam do corpo no qual se manifesta a sexualidade, desse modo deveriam tratar esse tema com outro olhar, mas falar da sexualidade ainda e um tabu e de certa maneira proibido, onde foi retratada pelas mesmas uma maior dificuldade em abordar o tema. Consideracoes finais: este estudo visou discutir o olhar da mulher idosa sobre sexualidade, em relatar o tema quebrando os tabus criados por uma sociedade muitas vezes machista e restritiva. Desta forma, constatou-se nesse estudo que entender como a idosa pensa e se sente em sua sexualidade e importante nao apenas para compreender o processo de envelhecimento associado a sexualidade, mas fundamental para conhecer e desenvolver estrategias que atenuem os efeitos da senescencia relacionado a sexualidade de forma a garantir a vivencia da mesma de forma positiva, sem medos ou preconceitos em falar sobre este processo fisiologico. E importante salientar que a perda do interesse sexual relatado, esta relacionada a qualidade do relacionamento amoroso e nao a fatores biopsicossociais naturais da senescencia na compreensao da satisfacao da idosa. Este processo depende, sobretudo nao apenas da idosa, mas de um acompanhamento de saude, e neste proposito contribuir para uma assistencia voltada para a saude sexual nesta fase tao importante da vida, que e a terceira idade. Reafirmou-se a falta de abertura social e capacitacao dos de saude profissionais para atender a essa demanda, os mesmos devem se despir de preconceitos, tabus, e principalmente das criticas.

Many girls are missed or misdiagnosed due to lack of understanding and misguided information. For many girls and women, the right diagnosis is the starting point to understanding themselves, undoing years of an abused and damaged sense of self and unpicking the potential consequent mental health conditions that have come with that. Through into adulthood, there is a perception of perfectionism, which can lead to high level and chronic stress, additional mental and physical health concerns, and again the reduction of knowing one's self while striving to be 'perfect' according to socially dictated norms. Autistic females are trying to adhere to social expectations placed upon them, often without fully understanding their own self and neurological make-up.",

      "title": "Impact des vieillissements physiologique et pathologique sur la relation sexuelle Impact of aging on sexuality",
      "abstract": "Numerous authors on sexual behaviors have studied the link between the persistence of a sexually active life and progressive aging. The knowledge of sexual health in the elderly has shown that biological sexual aging is extremely diverse and heterogeneous in men as well as in women, and contradicts the stereotype of age that would inevitably alter the sexual biological response in each human. Sexual diseases (lubrication, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, inability to achieve orgasm) and diseases of aging that impact sexual function have a growing incidence but don’t never touch 100 % of individuals. There is a decline in sexual interest correlated with the life-span, but the negative effects of age on desire are related to health problems. Moreover, sexual desire is more correlated with personal attitudes toward sexuality than with biological factors and diseases. Several predictors account for the pursuit of an active sexuality (including the presence of a partner, good health, having good sexual self-esteem, enjoyable past experience, an attitude that values the importance of sex in couple relationship), but the most decisive factor to successfully face the specific markers of aging is the ability to adapt to a more sensory sexuality, less focused on performance and coitus.

This study hypothesizes that religiously affiliated sexual minority women, when compared to non-sexual minority women, would show significantly higher levels of shame and lower levels of psychosocial development. This sample’s shame and psychosocial resolution scores all fell within the spectrum of normative levels for non-clinical samples of women. Significant differences between sexual status groups were found on shame and total negative psychosocial resolution, but effect size was small. It was also hypothesized that stages of psychosocial development, sexual status, and history of counseling would predict trait shame in religiously affiliated women. Psychosocial development was the sole significant and strong predictor, suggesting that the strong relationship between psychosocial development and shame is present regardless of a female’s sexual identity. For sexual minority women, identity/identity confusion, trust/mistrust, and autonomy/shame and doubt, accounted for 64% of shame variance. This sample was heavily weighted with women who reported same-sex attraction or same-sex behavior but who dis-identified as a sexual minority.",

The term ‘infertility’ includes both sub-fertility and absolute sterility. Biologically it implies that the capacity for producing offspring is diminished. Statistically or demographically it implies an observed reduction, irrespective of the cause, in the actual number of offspring produced. The causes of such reduction are varied. For example, an imbecile can be infertile on account of non-survival, he may be incapacitated also by gonadal dysgenesis or he may simply fail to attract a mate; genetically the result is the same. This key observation, the enumeration of total offspring, is a poor index of biological power. In practice it is the only feasible way of measuring biological fertility. It is also a measurement of ‘fitness’ in the genetical sense; indeed, natural selection, for or against a particular gene, is enforced by the actual numbers of offspring produced by the individual parent who carries it.",

Dr Beasley suggests that physical activity, social status, and diet should also be examined as confounding variables in the assessment of body weight and longevity. We did note in our report that improved understanding of the extent to which nutrition and physical activity influence, or mediate, the relationship observed between obesity and mortality is important. We believe, however, that there is a distinction between the nature of these variables and the methodological biases that we emphasized. These variables are not clear and distinct confounders of the weightmortality relationship in the same sense as cigarette smoking. Rather, they have complex interrelationships with body weight, and the causal pathways are unclear. For example, physical inactivity is both a cause and a consequence of obesity, and part of the benefit of exercise may be to control weight. Social status is",

      "abstract": "Despite their increasing knowledge and the availability of contraceptives and sex education programs teen-agers often do not use contraceptives. Factors affecting their nonuse of contraception include the following: 1) conscious or unconscious desires of young women to become pregnant without necessarily wanting a child; 2) the confirmation of masculinity for a young man by impregnating a woman; 3) the desire for security achieved by gaining peer support and feeling like 1 of them; 4) the feeling particularly of young women that planning for sex acknowledging its possibility and arranging for birth control makes them calculating loose and possibly immoral; 5) the impulsiveness and intensity of feelings of adolescents; 6) the widespread pressure to have sexual intercourse; 7) the myths and misconceptions about contraceptives; and 8) the difficulties in making information counseling and contraceptives easily available. If the use of a contraceptive is opposed by prevailing adolescent norms or represents a conflictual declaration of sexuality by the teen-ager the problem of contraceptive use increases. If contraceptives are offered without any examination or counseling problems also arise for the methods may be used incorrectly or may constitute an ecouragement of sexuality which the teen-ager may not be ready to handle. What the teen-ager often wants is help in sorting out feelings about a relationship or sex. Sometimes she/he may be asking for help in saying no because of ambivalence anxiety or a sense of not being ready. In relationships between young men and women it is often unclear as to who is to take responsibility for contraception. A psychiatrist can help the teen-ager develop the capacity to deal with her/his feelings and to predict behavior maximizing the possibility of planning. It is also important that the psychiatrist focus on family influences and issues without suggesting punitive or critical implications.",

Youth who are multiply marginalized by interlocking systems of racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, and so on are overrepresented in cultural and policy domains as “at risk” for negative health outcomes. At the same time, absences surrounding young people’s complex health needs and experiences abound in schools, healthcare settings, families, and the media. For instance, debates around sex education and teen pregnancy prevention have dominated the policy landscape for decades, with no signs of receding any time soon. Missing from these debates has been an analysis of how the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality structure the health outcomes and educational experiences of diverse youth. Likewise, queer, transgender, and gender-expansive youth are overrepresented in discussions about bullying to the detriment of the social structural factors that produce poor mental health outcomes. Understanding how gender and health play out in the lives of adolescents, as well as at the level of social institutions and structures, is central to teasing out the dynamics of gender, health, and social inequalities.",

Athletic identity can pose a significant distraction for providers as well as group therapy members, based upon the cultural idealization of the athlete as a heroic symbol of struggle. Athletic identity is a dominant identity and the level of identity foreclosure increases with the level of sports participation, which is high with elite athletes. Athletic performances can be heroic, but must be separated from the individual who has mortal thoughts, feelings, uncertainties, inadequacies, and fears like anyone else. The intersection of race, sexuality, gender, and sport contributes to the idea that Black American male athletes are necessarily heterosexual, and that gay athletes are exclusively White.

      "title": "Smoking in Andrology: State of Art",
      "abstract": "Andrology (from Greek andros, man; and -λογία, -logia) is a medical specialty that deals with male health, particularly related to the problems of the male reproductive system and urological problems that are unique to men. However, the scope and mission of Andrology is expanded from being traditionally concerned with issues related to male infertility, erectile dysfunction and prostate diseases in the past to broader interests in wide aspects related to male reproductive health and male health in general. A matter of concern in science as well as experience is smoking as an andrologically related issue. Actually, despite worldwide anti- smoking campaigns, cigarette smoking is rather common with strong evidences that smoking behavior is related to social factors, particularly the influence of parents and peer groups. Taste and smell also influence the inclination to smoke where exciting sensory organs in the lips, mouth and throat provide sensations of touch, taste and irritation. Also, it has been suggested that high negative mood variability is a risk factor for future smoking escalation and that its mood-stabilizing effects may reinforce and maintain daily cigarette use among youths. Strong body of evidence has indicated the negative effect of cigarette smoking on male fertility affecting every system involved in the reproductive process. Different articles have demonstrated a negative impact of smoking on human semen parameters, correlated with cigarettes intensity and duration. Most articles argued that smokers demonstrate lower semen volume, sperm count, sperm motility, sperm viability and normal sperm morphology compared with non-smokers. In addition, they experience increased seminal leukocytes, oval sperm percentage, spermatozoa with cytoplasmic droplets, apoptotic markers, seminal lead and seminal cadmium. In addition, passive exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has been shown to result in measurable seminal nicotine and cotinine levels correlated with the degree of the reported exposure. Meanwhile, the combination of smoking and varicocele has been shown to be strongly related to the incidence of oligozoospermia having an incidence 10 times greater than non- smokers with varicocele and 5 times greater than smokers devoid of varicocele (1-3). On the other hand, many opinions were raised to deny that affection on male infertility where millions of smokers are fathers. However, although smokers as a group may not experience reduced fertility, males with marginal semen quality may benefit from quitting smoking. Also, smokers should quit smoking for the sense of responsibility for their future generation as tobacco smoke contains numerous mutagenic substances. Nevertheless, while it is clear that Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is multi-factorial, the direct and negative effects of smoking on erectile function are well documented where several epidemiological studies demonstrated that smoking or even chronic passive smoking not only increases the risk of ED, but also amplifies its risk associated with other risk factors as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia or aging. Cigarette smoking-induced ED in human or animal models has been associated with impaired arterial flow to the penis, acute vasospasm of penile arteries, decreased synthesis/availability of nitric oxide leading to endothelial damage with architectural and functional changes, oxidative damage to endothelial cells, increased production of cyclooxygenase dependent and independent vasoconstrictor eicosanoids, activated Rho-associated kinase activity and vascular stiffness. Another interesting aspect that should be considered is the association between smoking and decreased testosterone that plays a major role in men's sexual function, libido and cGMP formation, through nitric oxide synthase stimulation/catabolism through phosphodiesterase-5 activity. Although cessation of cigarette smoking can improve ED in a considerable proportion of smokers, age and severity of ED before cessation are inversely related to the chance of improvement. Prevention of smoking represents a very important approach for reducing the risk of ED.",

The objective of this article is to review the growing body of literature linking weight outcomes with 2 aspects of temperament, negativity and self-regulation.Studies conducted through 2011 and assessing at least 1 weight outcome and 1 aspect of early negativity or self-regulation in normally developing infants and young children were included.Most studies suggest that greater levels of negative reactivity in early life may increase the risk of obesity, and greater self-regulation may be protective. While temperaments of individuals tend to be relatively stable over time, there is evidence that links between early temperament and weight outcomes are malleable.Relationships between temperament and weight outcomes are becoming well established. More research is needed to confirm the longitudinal nature of these relationships and to shed light on the mediators and moderators of these relationships and their implications for obesity interventions.",

In considering Bull Breeding Soundness Evaluation (BBSE) outcomes, it is important to consider all factors and their interactions, including age and genotype of the bulls and the environment in which they have been raised. There are both positive and negative genetic considerations with regard to bull fertility. Interest in bull sex-drive, or libido, arose from early work in Sweden which showed that this trait had a strong genetic component. Asymmetrical or overgrown claws and swellings over lower limb joints are common abnormalities, and may reflect poor conformation, pathological conditions, or both. The term 'testicular hypoplasia' refers to a relative lack of development of the spermatogenic epithelium. Testicular degeneration may be temporary or permanent, depending on the type and duration of the particular stressor which has caused the problem.",

      "abstract": "Mutation is an intrinsic property of genes and has provided the variability that we value as a characteristic of human populations as well as the variability that was necessary for evolution to occur. Nevertheless, an increase in mutation rate is almost universally regarded as undesirable. The likelihood that a random change in a gene will be beneficial to the host is small. The likelihood that it will be detrimental is much larger. There is much argument as to the proportion of genes that truly are neutral, but these are of no special concern to the present discussion. When a detrimental mutation occurs, it is expressed ultimately as failure of a zygote to develop, as abortion, as overt disease, or as reduced fertility. The expression may be immediate or delayed, depending on the degree of dominance of the mutalion. The social consequences of these different outcomes are different, much more so than the genetic consequences. A genetic death is failure to survive and reproduce, whether that failure be due to early death (as in Tay-Sachs disease) or to reduced fertility in an otherwise healthy person. Such detrimental genes are removed eventually from the population through natural selection—rapidly if the mutant allele is expressed in the heterozygote, much more slowly if the allele is completely recessive. Eventually an equilibrium is reached, with the number of mutant alleles eliminated by selection equal to the number produced by mutation. In the case of recessive alleles, many generations are required to establish a new equilibrium.",

Sur ces quatre affirmations repose le discours sur l’hypersexualisation. Elles sont examinées ici à la lumière des données disponibles sur le sujet. En fait, les données publiées sur les conduites sexuelles des jeunes Québécois et Canadiens ne permettent pas de conclure à une diminution de l’âge du premier rapport sexuel dans la dernière décennie (que ce soit pour le sexe oral, vaginal ou anal), ni à une exacerbation des activités sexuelles, ni à un déclin de la morale et des valeurs sexuelles.

Five broad statuses or prototypic styles of resolving the issues of this stage are proposed using combinations of (a) an individual's level of vital involvement, or active concern for the growth of the self and others, and (b) an individual's tolerance of different ideas, traditions, and values, which, by extension, determines the scope of caregiving concern. The Generative status is characterized by high vital involvement and tolerance, and represents the most positive psychosocial outcome. The Pseudogenerative-Agentic status is high in vital involvement and tolerance for self but not for others, while Pseudogenerative-Communal is high in vital involvement and tolerance for others but not for self. The Conventional status, high in vital involvement for both self and others, is low in tolerance across the board. Stagnant reflects the poorest psychosocial outcome, and is low in vital involvement and tolerance generally. A semistructured interview constructed to measure the statuses generated continuous and categorical ratings which were used to investigate inter-rater reliability and validity of the generativity prototypes (N=100). The dimensional scalings obtained higher reliability than the strictly categorical judgements, reaching acceptable levels. Convergence was",

He probably makes large sacrifices to defray the cost of a ‘good education,’ and is liable finally to sacrifice his boy’s chances of happiness and success by an injudicious decision about his future. His difficulties may be increased, curiously enough, by his failure to realise that conditions of entry into a career are radically different from what they were thirty or forty years ago. He perhaps is still sufficiently romantic to talk about, and even to believe in, the ‘self-made man’ ideal, although the impracticability of it in these days of combines and over-population is surely manifest. Or he is likely to adopt one of two favourite attitudes; either, that his personal experience of the exigencies of his own calling determines him not to allow his son to follow it, or that the only reasonable thing for a son to do is to step into his father’s shoes and continue the work built up for him. If he is neither romantic nor obstinate, he will consult his son’s inclinations and, in all probability, he will find them either fantastic or completely unformed. A normal boy rarely shows a marked aptitude for one particular business or profession in his early or middle school-days, and if he forms an opinion about his future it is usually much influenced by a limited knowledge of his father’s occupation.",

Los efectos conductuales, como la afectacion en la ingestion de comida y agua, y las convulsiones audiogenicas, son debidos al estres. Los efectos senalados en los seres humanos son iguales a los encontrados en los animales, pero las diferentes personalidades, el significado subjetivo y la patologia individual subyacente modifican la respuesta.

A lifespan perspective regarding visual impairment (VI) holds that the experience of VI since birth or early childhood is qualitatively different from the experience of individuals who acquire VI later in life. For example, in early childhood, VI impacts psychomotor and cognitive development that relies upon visual information processing and places challenges on the educational system, which must provide appropriate supports. In contrast, when acquired later in life, VI may place challenges on the ability to complete tasks of daily living, be independent, and engage in leisure activities, but not affect learning status or how knowledge is shared.",

The latter position, building on the strengths of the first four, argues that a handicapped newborn must possess a reasonable potential for minimal personal capacities to have a unique claim to life. Projected minimal capacities include personal self-awareness and net physiological benefit. If newborns are not expected to develop such capacities, parents should be free to choose the option of nontreatment.",

Within the first few months of life, children will require feeding on demand until they reach the weaning stage. To understand what constitutes normal feeding, it is important to briefly review children's developmental milestones and feeding and to discuss what we define as a functionally viable diet. Specific quantitative or qualitative research into the developmental, cognitive and appetite regulation aspects to feeding disorders is absent within the literature. A feeding disorder may also be attributed to a child that suffers medical consequences because their diet is characterised by poor dietary variety. Secure attachment is the only style of attachment with positive outcomes, where both parent and child feel at ease with one another. The descent into feeding disorder through poor attachment can occur directly through psychological dysfunction, but there are also some biological repercussions.",

      "abstract": "Is obesity really a public health problem and what does the construction of obesity as a health problem mean for men?\n\nAccording to official statistics, the majority of men in nations such as England and the USA are overweight or obese. Public health officials, researchers, governments and various agencies are alarmed and have issued dire warnings about a global ‘obesity epidemic’. This perceived threat to public health seemingly legitimates declarations of war against what one US Surgeon General called ‘the terror within’. Yet, little is known about weight-related issues among everyday men in this context of symbolic or communicated violence. \n\nMen and the War on Obesity is an original, timely and controversial study. Using observations from a mixed-sex slimming club, interviews with men whom medicine might label overweight or obese and other sources, this study urges a rethink of weight or fat as a public health issue and sometimes private trouble. Recognizing the sociological wisdom that things are not as they seem, it challenges obesity warmongering and the many battles it mandates or incites. This important book could therefore help to change current thinking and practices not only in relation to men but also women and children who are defined as overweight, obese or too fat. It will be of interest to students and researchers of gender and the body within sociology, gender studies and cultural studies as well as public health researchers, policymakers and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "Disability is commonly viewed as permanent loss of physical, cognitive and social aspects of self. Rehabilitation interventions are aimed to return the individual to full health by either restoration of past physical, cognitive or social capabilities or strengthening aspects of self to counter such loss. However, rehabilitation interventions do not result in a complete return to past physical, mental or social health. Does this mean that people with disability can never be healthy? Or does it indicate that our perception and definition of health does not reflect the essence of health? We argue that when people with disability redefine themselves in terms other than levels of physical, social and cognitive functioning, good health is an attainable goal. We discuss evidence that suggests why spirituality could be a primary determinant of health.",

This study considered whether stress must reach a critical threshold before hindering couples’ sexual activity and physical affection (i.e., a curvilinear association). Couples ( N = 144 couples plus four additional wives) completed two 14-day daily diary tasks during the early years of marriage. Multilevel modeling revealed a within-person curvilinear association between daily stress and sexual activity. Contrary to expectations, the likelihood of sexual activity declined as stress increased from low to moderate, then leveled off as stress continued to increase. For physical affection, a linear effect emerged. On days of greater stress, women, but not men, reported less affection. Further analyses suggested that women’s stress is more influential than men’s stress for couple’s physical intimacy. Findings highlight the nuanced ways in which stress is linked to a vital component of satisfying relationships.",

      "abstract": "Chairman Kanner: Every day of man9s life constitutes a transition between yesterday and tomorrow, converging in the intrinsic values of the moment. The past and present continue to shape and modify directions and goals, mostly through quiet evolution, sometimes in lively spurts. One of the liveliest spurts occurs during adolescence, at a time when a person is no longer a child and not yet an adult. Many incisive changes take place in that period. Body growth, in a remarkable upward surge, attains its maximum for the individual. The physique assumes its characteristic configuration. Sexual development reaches procreative capacity. There is striving after emancipation from sheltered existence, a trend toward increasing self-dependence in thought and action. The sphere of interest and participation expands from the confines of home, neighborhood and school to the community at large. The choice of vocation, until then a playfully considered matter, becomes a real issue. Current standards and precepts are submitted to criticism not as yet leavened by the tests of experience. The established order is challenged boldly and then, after some struggle, appropriated gradually with more or less reservation. Adolescence, in our culture, is a great translator. It translates the language of parental direction, attitudes and behavior into an individualized idiom. This is much less evident in primitive cultures. One might go so far as to say that in primitive societies there is no conceptual equivalent for that which we call adolescence. Childhood ceases abruptly when, through a set of elaborate rites, it is transported into full-fledged adulthood. Tribal ritualism, rather than personal spontaneity determines status and function. In our social structure, a child is given several years in which he is to find his way from a more or less manipulated and regimented existence to the acquisition of initiative in a loosely competitive environment in which the taboos are blurred, the semantics are equivocal, and the variety of occupational, political and theologic choices offers opportunities for perplexities. The adolescent translator9s dictionary is full of confusing synonyms and antonyms. A combination of inner soundness, wholesome parent-child relationship, and guidance from understanding adults, helps most adolescents to emerge safely from the groping and floundering which precede maturing stabilization.",

      "abstract": "Hunger and appetite are phenomena that have always been central to the study of motivation. They both belong to the domain of psychological inquiry that seeks to find the reasons underlying the actions of human beings and animals. When food consumption reduces hunger and inhibits further eating, two processes are involved. For technical precision and conceptual clarity it is useful to describe the distinction between \"satiation\" and \"satiety\". Hunger declines as satiation develops and usually reaches its lowest point at the end of a meal. The concept of the satiety cascade implies that foods of varying nutritional composition will have different effects on the mediating processes and will therefore exert differing effects on satiation and satiety. There is a disorderly relationship between the profile of hunger and the pattern of eating. This labile or unregulated hunger reflects a pathology of appetite.",

It is unknown why this phenonmenon occurs or whether it acquires specific characteristics among indigenous populations. Objective: To identifiy gender inequalities that underly excess body weight and obesity among the indigenous Maya Chontales of Tabasco. Materials and Methods: Qualitative study of 15 in-depth interviews of Chontal men and women. Interview themes included categories of lifestyle, ethnicity, customs and eating habits, uses and significance of the body, and gender norms. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Written informed consent for participation in the study, was well as ethics committee approval, were obtained. Results: Women tend to excess body weight and obesisty to a greater extent than men. Physical exercise is forbidden to women as public spaces for sports are exclusively male domains. After maternity, it is generally assumned that it is “normal” to be overweight. Obesity is considered an unavoidable genetic heritage, not a disease and weight loss is undesirable at any stage of life. Conclusions: Gender inequalities are an important conditioning factor in excess weight and obesity among Chontal women. The results of this study have implications for the promotion of healthy lifestyles for reducing rates of excess weight and obesity in indigenous populations,",

An online survey of 477 gay and bisexual men showed that, despite the prevailing muscular and lean gay body ideal, many men with less ideal bodies also preferred to watch pornographic actors with body types similar to their own. Self-perceived attractiveness, having an ideal body type, and viewing Internet pornography in longer sessions each made a unique contribution to higher self-esteem as a sexual partner. Preferring to watch pornographic actors with ideal bodies was not related to sexual self-esteem. The findings underscore the importance for gay or bisexual men of both self-perceived attractiveness and being athletic or young and fit, for a positive self-evaluation of sexual performance and competence.",

We next demonstrate that variation in the rate of aging within genera is orders of magnitude smaller than variation in pre-adult and age-independent mortality. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in the rate of aging, but not other mortality parameters, produce striking, species-atypical changes in mortality patterns. Our results support the invariant rate of aging hypothesis, implying biological constraints on how much the human rate of aging can be slowed.",

      "abstract": "Permasalahan agresivitas pada remaja semakin beragam dan kompleks bentuknya. Bahkan agresivitas pada zaman sekarang sudah menjalar ke media sosial, yang mana hampir setiap remaja mengenal dan menggunakan media sosial dalam kehidupan sehari-hari mereka. Permasalahan perilaku agresi di media sosial menjadi menonjol akhir-akhir ini karena tidak ada kekhawatiran pelaku akan dibalas secara langsung oleh korban ketika agresivitas remaja itu diluapkan di media sosial. Sehingga, keberanian mereka untuk menyakiti orang lain melalui media sosial lebih tinggi daripada dilakukan secara tatap muka langsung.\r\nPada zaman sekarang, agresivitas remaja perempuan juga cenderung meningkat. Bahkan, hasil terdapat hasil penelitian yang menyebutkan bahwa agresivitas perempuan tidak jauh berbeda tingkatnya dengan laki-laki. Remaja laki-laki lebih cenderung untuk meluapkan agresivitasnya baik proaktif maupun reaktif dengan teman sebayanya, lebih menekankan pada agresi fisik maupun verbal. Berbeda dengan perempuan, agresivitas mereka diluapkan dalam bentuk kebencian dan kemarahan, yang mana kebencian dan kemarahan mereka akan cenderung menetap lebih lama jika dibandingkan dengan remaja laki-laki. Bahkan tidak jarang pula ditemukan agresivitas remaja perempuan diluapkan dalam bentuk fisik dan verbal. \r\nPermasalahan agresivitas remaja usia sekolah ini perlu ada upaya penanganan agar kecenderungan mereka untuk meluapkan agresivitas mereka bisa di tekan dan dapat meminimalisir perilaku agresinya. Pada buku ini dikembangkan sebuah model bimbingan yang menggunakan ide-ide pokok dari pendidikan kedamaian, yang dalam buku ini disebut dengan bimbingan kedamaian. Model bimbingan kedamaian ini dirancang untuk mereduksi agresivitas remaja. Akan tetapi, tidak menutup kemungkinan bimbingan kedamaian ini dapat digunakan untuk membantu remaja keluar dari tekanan hidupnya seperti menekan perilaku bullying, cyberbullying, kekerasan fisik maupun non fisik, bahkan percobaan bunuh diri, dan lain sebagainya.\r\nBimbingan kedamaian yang dikembangkan dan termuat dalam buku ini terdiri dari tujuh komponen utama, yang digunakan untuk mengintervensi aspek-aspek dari agresivitas, baik fisik, verbal, kemarahan, dan kebencian. Ketujuh komponen dari bimbingan kedamaian tersebut adalah (1) rendah hati terhadap idealisme; (2) kontrol diri terhadap persamaan; (3) toleransi terhadap perbedaan; (4) memaafkan kesalahan orang lain; (5) memilih kekuatan daripada kelemahan; (6) mengatur emosi saya; dan (7) mengatur perilaku saya. \r\nBimbingan kedamaian ini dapat diimplementasikan dalam dua jenis layanan bimbingan dan konseling. Pertama, bimbingan kedamaian diimplementasikan dalam layanan bimbingan klasikal. Kedua, bimbingan kedamaian diimplementasikan dalam layanan bimbingan kelompok. Implementasi dari bimbingan kedamaian ini diharapkan dapat menekan agresivitas remaja yang mana agresivitas remaja ini dapat berdampak buruk bagi dirinya sendiri maupun orang lain. \r\nKonselor perlu menumbuhkan kreatifitasnya agar bimbingan kedamaian yang diimplementasikan tidak membosankan dan menarik bagi siswa. Terlebih remaja pada zaman sekarang, akan mudah bosan apabila mereka diberikan layanan bimbingan dan konseling yang tidak kreatif dan inovatif. Oleh sebab itu, penggunaan kearifan lokal sangat penting untuk menambah nilai lebih dan keefektifan dari bimbingan kedamaian itu sendiri. Kearifan lokal yang digunakan oleh konselor bisa merujuk dan memodifikasi kearifan lokal di daerahnya masing-masing.",

      "abstract": "Résumé Dans une société où les limites s’estompent et où l’apparence tient lieu de passeport identitaire, la plupart des adolescents cherchent à se distinguer des adultes et à partager entre pairs des marques ayant valeur de codes d’intégration. Ils le font à travers vêtements et parures, et sont tentés de marquer la peau elle-même (piercing et, à un moindre degré, tatouage). Mais ces signes de reconnaissance ne suffisent pas, au moins dans leur forme usuelle, aux adolescents qui souffrent de failles narcissiques et identitaires. Eux cherchent à se démarquer dans la rupture en exagérant cet autoétiquetage et/ou en se maltraitant la peau. Autour de 16 ans, ils sont entre 5 et 10 % à reconnaître se faire mal volontairement, avec une nette prédominance féminine. Les garçons heurtent plutôt leur peau contre des surfaces dures, tandis que les filles la scarifient et, moins souvent, l’abrasent ou la brûlent. L’auteur décrit ces formes de violence et distingue les lésions en fonction de leur caractère typique ou atypique, observations cliniques à valeur diagnostique et pronostique selon que l’attaque de la peau s’inscrit dans une impasse temporaire de l’œdipe pubertaire ou qu’elle révèle des troubles plus profonds et plus structuraux. Il expose en quoi les violences cutanées auto-infligées constituent un langage de l’indicible visant à la fois l’apaisement et la figuration inconsciente des souffrances psychiques, et interroge tour à tour les fonctions d’expression, d’inscription et de communication de ces actes-symptômes.",

The traditional view of black religion and recent empirical research suggest that the contribution of religious involvement to response to abortion should be unique among blacks. Results based on a sample of young, unmarried, low income black women indicate that they cannot be said to be otherworldly nor nonascetic and that involvement in organized religion is related to greater unhappiness upon learning of out-of-wedlock conception and greater regret one year after induced abortion, but not the choice of abortion per se. It is suggested that those with a religious orientation may be more attuned to the moral dilemma posed by out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and consequently experience a certain degree of ambivalence regardless of the means chosen to resolve it.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Genetische, endokrinologische, kulturelle und soziale Faktoren bewirken bei der Entstehung und Ausprägung der Adipositas umfassende Geschlechterunterschiede. Diese lassen sich sowohl in allgemeinen als auch essensspezifischen Verhaltensmerkmalen erkennen. Das Geschlecht beeinflusst die globale und regionale Hirnstruktur bei normal- und übergewichtigen Menschen. Adipositasbedingte Abweichungen betreffen vor allem das Belohnungssystem (orbito- und präfrontaler Kortex, Corpus striatum). Funktionelle Geschlechterunterschiede erfassen alle Regulationsebenen, auch die homöostatische. Geschmacksund Geruchsreize werden bei Männern und Frauen regional und graduell unterschiedlich verarbeitet. Hedonische Nahrungsreize sprechen besonders bei adipösen Frauen die Belohnungsareale des Gehirns stärker an und können durch die Regionen der Verhaltenskontrolle (OFC, PFC) weniger effizient abgeschwächt werden. Dies gibt Anlass dazu, die Adipositas bei Männern und Frauen auf homöostatischer und hedonischer Ebene differenziell zu betrachten und zu therapieren. Nicht ausreichend berücksichtigte Geschlechterunterschiede bei Adipositas könnten die potenzielle Ursache diskrepanter Forschungsergebnisse sein.",

By using a vignette approach, we find evidence that age influences life satisfaction through two counterbalancing channels. On the one hand, controlling for the effects of all other variables, the own perceived level of life satisfaction increases with age. On the other hand, given the same true level of life satisfaction, older respondents are more likely to rank themselves as \"dissatisfied\" with their life than younger individuals. Detrimental health conditions and physical limitations play a crucial role in explaining scale biases in the reporting style of older individuals.",

      "abstract": "Stress—an elusive, transient, yet transformative state we struggle to define. There are stress hormones, stressors, psychological stress, physical stress, restraint stress, social stress, the stress axis, acute stress, chronic stress, stress relievers, and unpredictable stress. Stress varies. One person’s motivator is another person’s slayer, challenging our ability to quantify and understand stress. The concept of allostatic load provides an integrated measure of physiological stress and lifestyle (1), while measures of the developmental origins of health and disease quantify early life events that are often antecedents to adult stress (2). Then there are nebulous psychological factors such as social support or lack thereof. Walsh et al. collated all of these to generate categories of maternal stress, with the goal of finding out which factors most impact fetal health and how (3). Not surprisingly, they find that excess stress during pregnancy is bad for the unborn child; this we knew, but what is surprising is how dramatic the impact is on boys, so dramatic in fact that we are left to infer how really bad it is since highly stressed mothers were significantly less likely to birth sons than daughters. So, what could be causing such a dramatic shift in sex ratio in stressed moms?\n\nA latent profile analysis of 187 early pregnant women using 27 variables from questionnaires and physical assessment generated 3 nonoverlapping categories: 1) healthy, 2) psychologically stressed, and 3) physically stressed. Over 65% of the women fell into the healthy category with the remaining roughly evenly split between physically and psychologically stressed. The physically stressed women had higher blood pressure and consumed significantly more calories per day than the healthy and psychologically stressed women, while the psychologically stressed scored higher on measures of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. These women also had significantly higher body mass index … \n\n[↵][1]1Email: mmccarth{at}umaryland.edu.\n\n [1]: #xref-corresp-1-1",

Emerging research seeks to identify the risk and resilience factors that contribute to the mental health of this stigmatised population. Considering that most Americans grow up with at least some religious teachings and that most major world religions have historically condemned same sex sexuality, the current study examines the association between religious tradition, religiosity, and NSSI behaviour. Results indicate that religion plays both a protective and harmful role for sexual minority youth. Those identifying as Christians with high religious guidance had the greatest risk, seculars had a comparatively moderate risk, and Christians with low religious guidance had the least risk. Implications for clinical practice and future areas of research are discussed.",

Contrary to the view that \"growth is for the young and loss is for the old,\" research on personal goals and memories demonstrates that older adults are at least as concerned with gain and growth as they are with loss. As for personal memories, we turn to quantitative research on narrative self-identity. Growth-oriented narratives are common in older adulthood. They predict well-being, differentiate hedonic from eudaimonic well-being, and differentiate two forms of eudaimonic well-being. Finally, we present a framework for studying resilience: hedonic resilience involves affect regulation in the wake of loss or potential trauma, whereas eudaimonic resilience includes affect regulation but additionally considers meaning regulation.",

This is due to most of the children who have ever become sexual abuse victims are reluctant to be open. Therefore, parents should be able to recognize the signs of the children experiencing any sexual abuse. Child Sexual abuse will result continuously terrible impacts, not only on its victims’ health problems but also on their psychological condition, such as permanent trauma, even after they have been grown up. The traumatic impacts of sexual abuse experienced by children are as follows: betrayal (betrayal or trust crisis of the children towards adults); traumatic sexualization; powerlessness (helpless feeling); and stigmatization. Physically, there is perhaps nothing to be questioned on sexual abuse victims, but psychologically, it can cause addiction, trauma, and even revenge. Unless it is treated seriously, child sexual abuse can lead to a broad social impacts in the society. Handling and healing psychological trauma as a result of sexual abuse should get serious attention from any related parties, such as family, society and country. Therefore, to protect children, it is necessary to provide a system approach including social welfare system for children and families, internationally standardized judicial systems and mechanisms to encourage appropriate behavior in the society",

      "title": "Poor contraceptive use in the teenage years: situational and developmental interpretations.",
      "abstract": "Contraceptive methods have helped to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among married women over the past few decades. Rates for teenagers have not, however, declined commensurately. Instead, greater premarital sex has led to more conceptions and births among teens. Developmental hypotheses suggest that poor teenage contraceptive use stems from characteristics intrinsically related to young age. Situational hypotheses, however, posit that life conditions complicate and impede the adoption of an effective contraceptive program. Social proscriptions against teen sex, the sporadic, unplanned, nature of teen sexual encounters, limited knowledge at the onset of 1st sex, and limited mobility and access to contraception are such life conditions. This essay considers both developmental and situational interpretations of teen contraceptive practice. Factors discussed related to contraceptive use include race and socioeconomic status, marital status, educational aspirations, religion, knowledge of fertility and contraception, attitudes and beliefs about contraception, personality factors, influence of parents, peers, and partners, and age. Adults and teens are found to have similar determinants of contraceptive behavior. Contraceptive use behavior differences between adults and teens may therefore exist because sexually active teens are disproportionately represented in demographic groups most likely to take risks. Adolescents being generally single, of low personal income, and increasingly members of single parent homes, share demographic circumstances of adults who are also more prone to risk-taking behavior. Limited knowledge of contraceptives and comparatively high levels of sex guilt further predispose youths to taking risks. Teenagers are therefore more likely to experience as a group those factors predisposing them to early sexual initiation and poor contraceptive use, thereby suggesting a situational interpretation of age differentials in contraceptive use. Adults similar to teens in adult life are similarly likely to take contraceptive risks.",

Although causative factors have yet to be fully elucidated, potential causes include, increased rates of obesity, poor diet, and exposure to environmental toxins. How this decline in sperm counts reflects fertility has yet to be determined. As such, further studies are necessary to evaluate whether this decline in sperm count correlates with decreased fecundity and how to identify and mitigate potential causative factors.",

Yet, limited research examines personal networks and participation on perceived loneliness and social isolation as distinct experiences among younger adults. Accordingly, we explore relationships among objective and subjective measures of personal networks with loneliness and isolation, comparing a younger and older cohort.The UC Berkeley Social Networks Study offers unique cohort data on young (21-30 years old, n = 472) and late middle-age adults' (50-70 years old, n = 637) personal network characteristics, social participation, network satisfaction, relationship status, and days lonely and isolated via online survey or in-person interview. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine associations between social network characteristics, loneliness, and isolation by age group.Young adults reported twice as many days lonely and isolated than late middle-age adults, despite, paradoxically, having larger networks. For young adults, informal social participation and weekly religious attendance were associated with fewer days isolated. Among late middle-age adults, number of close kin and relationship status were associated with loneliness. Network satisfaction was associated with fewer days lonely or isolated among both age groups.Distinct network characteristics were associated with either loneliness or isolation for each cohort, suggesting network factors are independently associated with each outcome, and may fluctuate over time. Network satisfaction was associated with either loneliness or isolation among both cohorts, suggesting perceptions of social networks may be equally important as objective measures, and remain salient for loneliness and isolation throughout the life course.",

      "abstract": "With increasing awareness of potential differences of autism presentation in nonmale versus male individuals, this review summarizes the rapidly evolving literature on sex and gender impacts on autism across nosology, behavioural presentation, developmental change and contextual recognition biases.Most studies have not differentiated sex versus gender impacts. Regarding behavioural presentation, measurement invariance across sex/gender was found in several standard measures. On this basis, diagnosed females overall showed lower restricted/repetitive behaviour/interests/activities (RRBI) than males, with small and variable effects depending on age, developmental level and kinds of RRBI. Differences insufficiently captured by standard measures may include autistic females displaying female-gender-typical narrow interests, higher social attention, linguistic abilities, motivation for friendship and more camouflaging than autistic males. Regarding developmental change, diagnosed young girls were more likely to have better cognitive development, less intense autistic symptoms and reduction of symptoms over time. Difficulties in adaptive functioning and social challenges, however, may emerge more for females in adolescence. Regarding diagnosis, general expectancy biases and gender-stereotypes may impede timely recognition of autism in females.Appreciating the multilevel sex and gender impacts on presentation, development, and diagnosis is key to sex-equitable and gender-equitable care for autistic individuals. A holistic approach to understanding the person in the contexts of sex and gender is essential for timely and accurate diagnosis and support.",

The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

The heritability of fat mass or percent body fat derived from underwater-weighing assessment of body density reaches '�-25% of the age- and gender-adjusted pheno- typic variance. The within-identical-twin-pair resemblance in the response to a standardized overfeeding protocol emphasizes the importance of the genotype in determining individual dif- ferences in body weight and body composition.

The progressive increase in life expectancy shows how fragile such an achievement may be, as ageing enhances susceptibility to a large variety of disorders with implications for physical and mental wellbeing. Addressing the biological aspect of ageing is thus necessary to achieve not only longer, but also healthier, life in the future. Cell and animal models with value for humans reviewed here indicate that continued accumulation of errors is the most probable reason for ageing. Moreover, there is extensive data favoring the view that such errors result from imperfect or abnormal processes of metabolism, whose fine mechanisms have been progressively unveiled. Interestingly, genetic manipulation of pathways that make use of nutrients results in a slowing of the ageing process, recognized as the reduction of disease burden and increased lifespan.",

The tenn codependency has so dose correlation with a family that it could not be considered separately each other It is reported that the family of the alcoholic is not only irregular in its environment and showing more deficits and a large family, also the members of the family experience more emotional problems, especially the children do not well at school and have low social accomplisrunents as well as having more physical and psychological symptoms related to antisocial actions and alcoholic compared With a normal family. In other words, the alcoholic family not only has lower cohesive power of the family, lower life satisfaction and family functioning than a normal family, showing a dysfunctional type of communication prominently, but also having strict rules and rolls. As drinking is getting more chrome, the higher family raise the rate of getting in such codependency symptoms as derual, low self respect, feel of guilty, depression, uneasiness, and chaos etc. A dependent of the codependency makes features of a dishonesty, an anger, a hostile feeling, an adjuslment, a perfectionism, and a dependency. Also he experiences difficulties in making relationship because of having difficulties in forming a functional boundary with others. In addition, he Jays emphasis on meeting requirement of the alcoholic prior to the acknowledgement and fulfillment of self aspiration. So he feels an uneasiness at the threat of breaking a symbiotic interdependency relation. as well as having a fear of wrong self loss made in symbiotic relationship. For this reason, the codependent among members of the family have a deep feeling of rejection, uneasiness, or fear. The children of the alcoholic with a symptom of excessive responsibility tend to be good at their study, while those making slow and showing a symptom of fitnessism have features of bad at the study, frequent late for school, and late submitting the homework Some of them also have features showing a symptom of creating a good atmosphere and solving all the problems properly. They are generally distracted, enjoy something to hide, somewhat critical, making funny actions, and having difficulties in establishing self subjective identity due to an easy conformity with others.",

Other conflicts can arise because of our heterogeneous society, where parents of a stricter ethnic origin find their children demanding what seems to them unreasonable freedom.",

Our research aimed at complex recognition of sexual functioning, usual behaviour in all revealing spheres, normal aspects: dreams, imagining, masturbation, foreplay, coitus and sexual attitudes. 200 persons were sample in this research: 100 alcohol addicts and 100 persons of the control group. Following results were obtained: • dreams of sexual contents are rare both with addicts and other population, but significantly larger percent of alcoholics has “wet or orgasmic” dreams, • day-dreaming is less noticed with alcoholics, meaning that the need for raising sexual vigilance is reduced, • alcoholics masturbate more, they start to masturbate in later stage, • addicts rarely have foreplay and its duration is shorter, as a consequence of disturbed intimacy and impossibility of total harmony and exchange with a partner, • alcoholics have less sexual intercourses and feel different during them • there are no great differences in opinions about sex, • structural personal characteristics also have effect on sexual behaviour and alcoholism. Alcoholics have certain personal characteristics that clearly define them and which, because of their nature, influence addiction development and sexual behaviour. We can conclude from the research that a tendency in behaviour is evidenced, and for which can be said that it is \"pattern of sexual functioning of alcoholics\". Except difficulties in genital response, \"pattern\" refers to emotional component, meaning closeness or a level of intimacy with partner, as well as modification of \"normal” sexual aspects.",

Scientists have learned that very young infants experience shame (as a personal feeling of unworthiness and shame), when they experience rejection-even if it is unintentional. Children, who are admonished for doing something over which they have limited or no control, are also capable of feeling shame. On a more serious, long-lasting scale, physical and sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences, particularly those that happen directly to the child, without adequate intervention, may lead to the development of shame as well. Considering the origin of the shame-wound is critical as well. If one is the child of abusive and/or addicted parents, their shame could have been an emotional and psychological transplant. Assessing if the shame is a consequence of actions, inactions, or someone elses conflicts, can allow for internal conflict resolution.",

This requires trade-offs, such as age versus size at maturity, number versus quality of offspring, current versus future reproduction, and fecundity versus lifespan. Humans are characterized by large brains and long lives, as well as by a singleton pregnancy, long post-natal nutritional dependency, a prolonged juvenile period, delayed sexual maturity, and modest sexual dimorphism. Females terminate reproduction before the end of their intrinsic lifespan. Humans produce few offspring, which benefit from high parental investment and a high rate of survival to adulthood. Disconnection between the age of biological puberty and acceptance as an adult can lead to problems of adolescence. Evolutionary considerations can explain the unusual characteristics of human life history, including the long childhood phase, the pubertal growth spurt, and menopause.",

One understudied cost of large bodies is the high number of cell divisions and the associated risk of oncogenic mutations. Our elasticity analysis shows that selection against a proportional increase in size becomes ever more intense with increasing body size if cancer is the sole selective agent. Thus cancer potentially halts body size increases even if no other constraint does so. We then provide multicellular realism with potentially sexually dimorphic body sizes and traits that control cell populations from zygote to maturity and beyond (ontogenetic management). This shows sexual conflict to extend to ontogeny; sexual dimorphism in mortalities and other life history measures may evolve even in the absence of any ecological causes underlying size- or sex-dependent mortality. Coadaptation of ontogenetic management and body size is required for substantial increases in size.",

No country. has more need to profit by the newer knowledge of Nutrition, and none more opportunity to add to it. Millions of the Indian people are living on restricted diets which are either incapable of maintaining them in a state of normal nutrition and health, or capable only of sustaining them at a low level of physical efficiency. Malnutritional diseases are rife, while the great scourges of the Tropics-malaria, cholera, dysentery, leprosy-exact an immense toll from India's malnourished multitudes. In this Presidency alone deficiency diseases' of almost every kind abound, and the level of physical efficiency of the masses is, in general, low. But while this is so in certain parts of the Peninsula there are others where the inhabitants are unsurpassed by any race of mankind in physique and capacity for endurance and hard work. Nowhere is the composition of human dietaries more influenced by racial, religious, economic and climatic considerations and nowhere have foods and food-habits remained more consistently the same from one generation to another. So it is that the diverse races, comprising the population of India, afford an unrivalled, and almost wholly unexplored, source of information regarding the effects of diet on the physical efficiency of human beings. India has thus not only much to do in applying the newer knowledge of Nutrition and in surveying, in the light of this knowledge, the foods available for the use of her immense populations, but much to learn regarding their nutritional needs, and much-by such learning-to teach the rest of the world.",

      "abstract": "The life history of a mammal species can be defined by variables such as the mean length of gestation, the size and number of offspring at birth, the interval between births, the age at which weaning takes place and body size at that time, the age at which males and females first breed successfully, their size as adults and the age at death. Some species ‘live fast and die young’ and, at the other extreme, some species ‘live slow and die old’ (Promislow and Harvey, 1990; Smith, 1992). A ‘fast’ mammal might typically have a short gestation time, multiple small offspring, a short birth interval, early age of weaning and of sexual maturity, and a short lifespan. It would be small in body size at each stage. A ‘slow’ animal would have a long gestation time, after which one or a few large babies would be born, a long interval for each female between successive births, a late age of weaning and maturity, and a long lifespan. Offspring would be large at all stages and born from large mothers. Body size is thus strongly related to the pace at which life history unfolds but, when the mean values for life history variables in different species are plotted against one another, they remain correlated even when the effect of size is removed.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> As the global population aging accelerates, especially in low-middle-income countries, an increase in age-related and sexual health challenges can be expected. However, for various reasons including a focus on reproductive ages, ageist stereotypes, taboos and stigma and limited resources, sexuality as broadly defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in older adults is often neglected. This study used qualitative methods to explore the attitudes and perceptions of sexuality and sexual behaviour among older adults aged 50 years and above. Focus group discussions with 37 South African men and women (aged 50-78) were thematically analysed using an ethnographic and phenomenological naturalistic paradigm. Four major themes emerged from the analysis: the importance of sexuality and frequency of sexual activity, gendered perspectives on sexual activity, health state as a barrier to sexual activity, and cultural influences on sexuality and behaviour. Study highlights the significant role cultural norms and beliefs can play in old-age sexuality, with distinct gender differences in sexual practices. Health conditions, including chronic illnesses, disabilities, frailty and HIV status can act as barriers to sexual activities among older adults. Understanding these barriers and facilitators of sexuality in older adults is crucial in addressing sexual health concerns and challenges faced by older adults. Overall, the study contributes valuable insight into the often-neglected topic of sexuality in older adults, and the complexity of factors influencing sexual behaviours in ageing populations. There is a need for a holistic approach and further research to bring this subject matter to the attention of policy and programme makers. The scarcity of data and evidence on sexuality and sexual health needs of older adults in low-and-middle-income countries hinders the development of policies and targeted interventions to address the specific sexual health needs of older adults.",

Fluid balance is maintained via thirst, a feedback-controlled variable, regulated acutely by central and peripheral mechanisms. However, voluntary drinking is also a behavior influenced by numerous social and psychological cues. Therefore, whether \"thirst-guided\" drinking maintains optimal hydration status is a multifactorial issue. Thirst perception is typically assessed by subjective ratings using either categorical or visual analog scales; however, which instrument yields greater sensitivity to change in hydration status has not been examined. Ratings of thirst perception do not always yield predictable patterns of voluntary drinking following dehydration; therefore, perceived thirst and ad libitum drinking are not equivalent measures of human thirst. The recommendation \"drink to thirst\" is frequently given to healthy individuals during daily life. However, factors and conditions (e.g., age, disease) that influence thirst should be recognized and probed further.",

It is noted that the fears of the modern man are caused by the inability to comply with the standard (stereotype) of the commonly accepted man`s role. The masculine gender role stress is resulted from the negative consequences of different situations when man feel hard to meet standard of masculinity, or when the circumstances require him to show feminine behavior model which he cannot follow due to his nature. This conflict can be found both interpersonally and interpersonally. Anxiety, depression, decreased self-assessment, stress, relationship problems, conflicts at work, physical and sexual abuse are possible consequences of such conflict.",

      "title": "ERECTION DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The first physiological response to effective sexual stimulation, produced by a source of physical or mental stimulation, is the erection of the penis. Erection usually occurs within 3-8 seconds of the onset of arousal. When sexual tension and erection reach a certain level in the presence of the partner, the need for interference appears. The intensity of the erection may increase or decrease until it disappears, whether the arousal is prolonged or not. The complicated anatomical apparatus is regulated by a nervous mechanism, just as complex, being dependent to a remarkable extent on psychic influences. By the strong interweaving of these two components - psychological and functional - the sexual function is subject to changes. Erectile dysfunction, when it occurs, is obvious because, although there may be libido, the lack of an erection makes it impossible to perform sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction should not be confused with isolated or occasional failures to obtain or maintain a penile erection. They do not constitute a condition or disease that justifies medical attention and should be perceived as absolutely normal. The vast majority of men face such an episode at some point in their lives. One can speak of erectile dysfunction in the case of a recurrent or persistent inability to obtain an erection or to maintain it long enough to complete sexual intercourse, which lasts at least three months. It is especially important because in a normal activity, without erection, intercourse, ejaculation and orgasm cannot take place. (Pathologically, premature ejaculation can occur, without an erection, in the form of pollution!)",

Medicine offers us a pile of new strategies to enhance our physical possibilities. Despite many medical ethicists feel appealed to discuss the do’s and don’ts of enhancement, I prefer to discuss the limit between treatment and enhancement and the question: what do we describe as a disease? Do we have good and strong medical arguments for this distinction, and if not, do we not have to reconsider to go on with this distinction as the ethical foundation to differ between good and bad? Or to put it the other way round: do we need to categorize something as a treatment of a disease, in order to tolerate it?",

Continuous—time demographic models presented here explicitly account for growth, including individual variability in growth rate, and assume that size alone determines the birth and death rates. Growth and mortality processes are introduced that result in a normal distribution (on some scale of measurement) of the sizes of individuals within a cohort; this permits the cohort to be described in terms of only three variables; mean size, variance in size, and proportion of individuals surviving. Using general formulae for the intrinsic rate of population increase and the stable size distribution, applications of the models are presented illustrating the effects of individual growth rate variance and size—specific mortality on characteristics of the population.",

      "abstract": "One or a combination of age, period or cohort effects may drive changes in trends over time, for example, producing a widening or narrowing of socioeconomic differences in an outcome or leading to an increase or decrease in an outcome for one socioeconomic group alone. Age effects mean that the change occurs in all individuals at a particular age irrespective of when they were born or the current time period. For example, an increase in socioeconomic differentials occurring at the age of retirement (irrespective of what time period is being examined or which birth cohort individuals were born in) would be described as an age effect. A cohort is a group of people defined by a particular attribute (or set of attributes). In the context of age-period cohort effects, ‘cohort’ refers to birth cohort. Thus, the group (cohort) are defined by the period (usually the year) in which they were born. Cohort analysis is the tabulation and analysis of data, such as morbidity and mortality rates or educational outcomes, in relation to the birth cohorts of the individuals concerned. Cohort effect (also known as generational effect) refers to variations in health status that arise from the different causal factors to which each birth cohort in the population is exposed. Every birth cohort is exposed to different social and environmental circumstances that coincide with its life span. Because the meaning of socioeconomic measurements varies by birth cohorts (for example, a female who was born in 1910 obtaining a university degree is likely to have been from a different social stratum to a female born in 1975 obtaining a university degree) cohort effects are important to consider when examining the association of socioeconomic position (SEP) with health and other outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

However, in the recent past, a debate existed about whether very slim models should be depicted in magazines and used in advertisements. Researchers articulated concerns about negative effects resulting from a slim-is-beautiful stereotype that could have been learnt if slim models are depicted in the context of beauty and life-style products. These negative effects exist if young average-sized females are dissatisfied with their figure and thus take unhealthy measures to approach to a very low body weight. Grove et al. (2003) even postulated that a slim figure is one aspect for women to define their value. Empirical literature provides support to the hypothesis that extremely slim advertising models reduce young females' appearance self-esteem. Moreover, this phenomenon is often associated with eating disorders.",

This dissatisfaction is reinforced by the comments of men, particularly their partners. Food, as well as being a ‘fattening’ enemy is a comfort and is resorted to at times of emotional stress. Women's ‘normal’ relationship with food lies on a continuum of which the eating disorders are the extremes and is a product of their structural position in society.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Mates high in physical attractiveness are in short supply, which means that not all people are able to find mates who are sufficiently attractive. Threshold models of mate preferences suggest that when physical attractiveness minimums are not reached, other traits possessed by a potential partner may play a lesser role in mate choice. However, few studies have sought to understand mating decisions when those minimums are not met. Methods In this experiment ( N = 186), participants rated images of (pre-rated) unattractive opposite-sex others for long-term and short-term relationships after learning dealbreaker or dealmaker information. Results While participants did not find targets highly desirable or physically attractive (as a stimulus check), men were more willing than women to have casual sex, and that men and women reported similar desirability ratings towards long-term partners. Learning dealbreakers was associated with less desire for the targets than dealmakers, but women’s lack of interest was insensitive to mating context, whereas men found the target especially undesirable in the long-term context. Additionally, men were willing to consider a long-term relationship with a physically unattractive partner who possessed dealmakers, but not one who possessed dealbreakers. Conclusions Our discussion focuses on men and women’s mating decisions when potential partners fail to meet minimum thresholds for physical attractiveness. Future research is needed to explore the magnitude of the effect of meeting or failing to meet one’s minimum thresholds for physical attractiveness.",

Our research aims to deepen knowledge and understanding of men´s experiences of using AAS.Method: This phenomenological study is based on the reflective lifeworld research approach. Lifeworld interviews were conducted with twelve men about their experiences of using AAS.Results: By using AAS, men strive towards a muscular, strong and athletic ideal. Self-imposed demands, self-discipline and performance accelerate male physical development. The perfect male body ideal thus attained is fragile from both an existential and a biological perspective. The perfect self-image can easily be shattered by adversity. A man's very existence may be jeopardized if the use of AAS is revealed to others or if the body is let down by illness.Conclusions: Men´s use of AAS is a complex phenomenon. It partly concerns a traditional view of masculinity that is reflected in the community. It requires both broad and deep knowledge and understanding to be able to meet men using AAS in their problems and vulnerability; a meeting that is hampered by their low trust in healthcare, and by the fact that AAS are illegal.",

The present research used a novel groups paradigm to investigate whether children (N=121) and adults (N =89) hold essentialist beliefs about social status (thinking of status as shared among group members, stable, heritable, and derived from intrinsic causes) and whether these beliefs contribute to discrimination and bias toward members of a low-status novel group. Participants endorsed some aspects of status essentialism (viewing status as a group-linked property) but not others (not viewing status as stable, heritable, or inherent). Neither children nor adults displayed a behavioral or affective preference for the higher-status group, or prejudice toward the lower-status group, not even when status was viewed as a group-linked property. This study suggests that more complex and multi-dimensional essentialist beliefs about status might be necessary to engender discriminatory attitudes and behaviors toward lower-status groups.",

      "abstract": "SummaryThe determinants of the timing of menarche are many, and it is difficult to isolate a single factor which may delay or accelerate this maturational event. Menarche, on average, occurs later in athletes, including ballet dancers, than in the general population. With few exceptions, the data are consistent across several countries. Swimmers are an exception to the tendency towards later menarche in athletes. In all samples of swimmers surveyed but one, menarche tends to approximate the average for the general population. The menarcheal data are consistent with other indices of biological maturity status, i.e., skeletal age and secondary sex character development. The data dealing with the effects of intensive physical training on menarche are reviewed and given the number of factors involved, it is difficult to implicate training as a factor which specifically delays menarche. A two-part hypothesis for the apparent maturity delay in athletes is thus suggested. The hypothesis combines biological selective factors (i.e., physique and skill) and social factors. Family size and composition, however, must receive more consideration. Family size influences the timing of menarche and such a trend is apparent in data for several groups of athletes.",

      "title": "Risk Orientation and Risk-Taking Behavior: The Impact of Race/Ethnicity and Gender on Mental Health and Substance Use among Young Adults",
      "abstract": "Current research on the well-being of youth and young adults claims that this stage of the life course includes a higher propensity for risk-taking behavior than earlier or later periods. While most youth tend to âage outâ of this high-risk period, less is known about the precursors of such behaviors or under what circumstances these behaviors persist. The preponderance of studies in this area focus heavily on individual-level, psychological, or neurological/biological explanations for the relationship between risk and well-being. What appears to be missing from this research is a critical examination of how social status (e.g., race/ethnicity and gender) plays a role in shaping how risk impacts well-being. This dissertation takes a closer look at the relationship between risk and well-being and whether patterns vary by race/ethnicity and gender. This work merges tenets of several theories, including the risk and resilience framework (Anthony and Cohen 1987; Dent and Cameron 2004; Egeland, Carlson, and Sroufe 1993; Hollister-Wagner, Foshee, and Jackson 2001; Kaplan 2005; Luthar, Cicchetti and Becker 2000; Schofield 2001; Rutter 1985; 2001), the life course perspective (George 2007), and intersectionality theory (Chappell and Havens 1980; Crenshaw 1989; Dowd and Bengston 1978; Good and Wood 1995; Rosenfield 2012). Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), outcomes are assessed among a nationally representative sample of African American, Latino, and white youth (N= 1,483). The results demonstrate that 1) risk orientation (i.e., the propensity to find risk acceptable) is shaped by different factors across race and gender, 2) the benefits and consequences of risk vary by outcomes (e.g., curvilinear effect on depressive symptoms, but linearly related to alcohol use), and 3) risk and well-being have a reciprocal relationship for some groups (e.g., African Americans and women), but not others (Whites and Latino men). The impact of risk orientation on well-being is independent of risk-taking behaviors, and scholars should continue to study both the potential benefits and consequences of risk across the life course and across social status.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between sexual orientation and religious experience of men from early adolescence to adulthood. Data have been obtained from an online survey of 1,042 males who were part of a larger sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) persons who are current or former members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐Day Saints (LDS, Mormon). While early religious experience was essentially identical to that of heterosexuals, the gap between religious norms and experience widened as these men moved through early and mid‐adulthood. Those who married did so at a later age, and experienced a high rate of divorce. Continued participation, integration, and conformity to LDS ideals was not attributable to faith in, or a departure from, fundamental doctrinal belief. Instead, the responsible variable was sexual orientation, measured by the Kinsey Scale scores across behavior, attraction, and identity. For those near the exclusively homosexual end of the spectrum, the failure to change sexual orientation after intense effort over many years resulted in loss of belonging, belief, and participation, along with increased negative emotions and a sense of mistreatment .",

      "abstract": "Pediatricians know that it is desirable for an infant to have a healthy start in life. But they also know that the young child who suffers inadequate nutrition, a severe infection, or physical trauma, is not thereby doomed, except in extreme cases, to a life of physical inadequacy. The human organism is resilient and in most instances capable of recouping the damage caused by malnutrition, infection, or trauma. The issue is the same for psychological development. It is desirable for the mother and the father to have immediate and active contact with their newborn baby. But absence of such contact does not prevent parent bonding to the infant nor does it doom the infant to less than optimal development. A relaxed and emotionally positive attachment between the 1-year-old infant and the mother is indeed valuable. But the mother does not need extraordinary capacities for this to occur. And if, for some reason, either the mother's bonding to the infant or the infant's attachment to the mother is impaired, this does not foretell failure in later emotional relationships. The establishment of reasonable feeding and sleep routines and ease in toilet training are assets for healthy development. But difficulties with these or other socialization landmarks do not necessarily predict psychological outcomes. As I have stated previously,19 \"The emotionally traumatized child is not doomed, the parents' early mistakes are not irrevocable, and our preventive and therapeutic intervention can make a difference at all age-periods.\"",

      "title": "Ageing: The Role of Ageism",
      "abstract": "Worldwide, people are living longer but not necessarily experiencing optimal health since healthy ageing stems from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. The growing interdisciplinary literature on ageism from education, medicine, psychology, and social work increasingly highlights the pivotal role that ageism plays in ageing. Ageism is generally an overlooked factor in understanding and fostering healthy ageing. Ageism creates a negative view of the ageing process as marked by inevitable deterioration and decline, and ageism sets in motion wide-reaching negative biopsychosocial consequences for people along the lifespan. To contribute to a fuller understanding of factors that influence healthy ageing, this article applies an interdisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach to ageing by integrating insights from the burgeoning literature on ageism. The role of ageism on ageing is reviewed as a double-edged sword in terms of how (1) being the target of ageism on the one side (e.g., someone being treated as incompetent, forgetful, sickly or as a burden) leads to negative physical, psychological, and social consequences and how (2) being the perpetrator of ageism on the other side (e.g., someone poking fun of, avoiding, or bullying older adults for their age or older appearance) also leads to negative physical, psychological, and social consequences Across one's life and/or during particular periods of one's life, the same person may be both a target and perpetuator. This article reviews findings showing how combating ageism in turn can improve healthy ageing. This review reaches the conclusion that the study of ageism and its reduction is an important piece in the puzzle of understanding how to foster healthy ageing. In light of the serious nature of ageism and the growing older population worldwide, it is timely and necessary for research on ageing to increasingly consider the intervening role of ageism on healthy ageing.",

Scaling children's doses by a power of body weight predicts that they would be less sensitive to chemicals than adults, owing to faster clearance. Possible countervailing factors, however, are the role of quicker pharmacodynamic processes, differences between interspecific and ontogenetic allometry, and the complex role of inherent differences in the metabolism and physiological system of immature bodies, the last leading to uncertainty in extrapolation but not necessarily to systematic sensitivity among children. The issue of scale per se does not appear to provide a basis for positing a systematically greater sensitivity of children to toxic substances",

There are many myths surrounding ageing and sexuality fuelled by assumptions that libido and sexual needs decline along with the loss of culturally valued signs of beauty or handsomeness. By 75–85 years of age, only one-quarter of the population is sexually active; the reasons for this are many and include psychosocial factors such as loss of a partner, age-related physiological changes and illness. In older women, the major problems are reduced libido, poor lubrication and inability to climax. In males, erectile dysfunction is the central problem. Health problems are the major reason for a decline in sexuality with ageing. Drugs for the management of erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) and new delivery systems to treat low libido (patches, nasal, gels, injections of testosterone) are revolutionizing sexuality in older persons. There is increased awareness of the special needs of the older homosexual. Paraphilias are life-long and do not necessarily disappear with ageing. Management of inappropriate and aggressive sexual behaviours in older persons with dementia is a major problem.",

      "abstract": "It is generally believed that Western culture’s emphasis on thinness is responsible for the presence of eating disorders and body image dissatisfaction. However, Asians living in Western societies who are more acculturated to Western values have shown fewer body image and eating problems than their less acculturated Asian peers, while those who are highly acculturated to their native culture may be at increased risk for eating disorder symptoms. In this study, Chinese and Caucasian students attending United States universities completed measures of body image, body esteem, disordered eating and ethnic identity in the language of their choice (English or Simplified Chinese). As expected, females demonstrated higher levels of disordered eating and body dissatisfaction than males, regardless of ethnicity. There were no between-ethnicity differences in disordered eating and body image dissatisfaction, though Caucasians demonstrated higher ratings of their own attractiveness than Chinese language responders. For the Chinese participants, experiencing an unstable sense of identity was associated with increased disordered eating and body dissatisfaction for men and women, respectively. Looking at the Chinese language participants specifically, ethnic identity search behaviors alone were associated with increased risk for the eating-related outcome variables. Results pertaining to the Chinese participants who responded in English yielded a surprising pattern. They were not different from Caucasians or their Chinese-responding counterparts for any of the body image and eating disorder measures, and there was no relationship between ethnic identity and either body dissatisfaction or disordered eating. These findings highlight the importance of allowing participants a language choice for methodological reasons, as well as to identify potential differences between language-based subsets of responders.",

Preferences for averageness, symmetry, and health did not emerge until middle childhood and experienced apparent disruption or stasis around age 10- to 14-years; femininity was not preferred until early adulthood, and this preference was seen only in girls. Children's pubertal development was not clearly related to any facial preferences, but the results are consistent with the suggestion that early adrenal hormone release may play an activating role in mate preferences, while other constraints may delay further increases in preferences during later puberty.",

This paper argues that the health of minimally contacted Amerindians, as judged by the results of physical examinations and life tables for the Yanomama of Southern Venezuela and Northern Brazil, is relatively good, with population control a feature of the Indian culture. It is further argued that the usual deterioration in health with contacts with western culture probably does not result so much from special innate susceptibilities to certain epidemic diseases and to the diets and 'stresses' of civilization as from the epidemiological characteristics of newly contacted peoples.",

      "title": "El impacto psicológico de los sucesos vitales en personas mayores: el papel del pensamiento rumiativo, la evitación experencial y el crecimiento personal",
      "abstract": "La investigacion sobre el efecto de los sucesos vitales en la salud mental no es nueva en psicologia, si bien el numero de estudios realizados con personas mayores no es elevado. De la misma manera, la literatura cientifica ha encontrado evidencias de que estrategias como la rumiacion o la evitacion experiencial son desadaptativas, al asociarse a consecuencias negativas para la salud mental y fisica de las personas. Por el contrario, la literatura sobre el crecimiento postraumatico sugiere que esta variable puede contribuir a facilitar la adaptacion y superacion de las consecuencias negativas de las situaciones traumaticas. A pesar de estas cuestiones, hasta donde sabemos no se ha estudiado en que medida la utilizacion de estrategias de regulacion emocional especificas para sucesos vitales concretos contribuye a explicar el malestar de las personas mayores. Especificamente, desconocemos si estas variables pueden influir en la relacion entre los eventos vitales y el malestar psicologico mediando esta relacion o si ejercen efectos directos. Por otra parte, y teniendo en cuenta que el fallecimiento de personas queridas es un acontecimiento estresante que tiene mayores probabilidades de ocurrencia en la vejez, el diseno y evaluacion de una intervencion psicologica dirigida a favorecer la utilizacion de estrategias de regulacion adaptativas para el afrontamiento de la perdida de un ser querido supone un objetivo de interes tanto clinico como social, por los beneficios que puede aportar a la poblacion mayor. El trabajo que se presenta consta de dos estudios, uno de caracter correlacional transversal, en el que participan 393 personas mayores, y otro de intervencion, en el que 8 personas mayores son distribuidas al azar a un grupo de intervencion y a un grupo control. En ambos casos se evaluan, siguiendo el modelo de estres y afrontamiento, variables relativas a caracteristicas sociodemograficas de las personas mayores, estresores (acontecimientos vitales), variables mediadoras (pensamiento rumiativo y crecimiento asociados a acontecimientos vitales, evitacion experiencial y rumiacion general, entre otras) y variables de resultado (sintomatologia depresiva y bienestar psicologico). Dependiendo del estudio, las tecnicas de analisis de datos que se utilizan son variadas, abarcando desde analisis descriptivos hasta analisis de ecuaciones estructurales, pasando por regresiones jerarquicas y analisis de conglomerados. Para los analisis de eficacia de la intervencion se utilizan criterios estadisticos tradicionales (cambio pre-post) mas indicadores de tamano del efecto y evaluacion de la implementacion de la intervencion. La tesis doctoral aporta como resultado las escalas de evaluacion del impacto psicologico de sucesos vitales pasados, que constan de 3 subescalas: ocurrencia de sucesos vitales negativos y positivos, pensamiento rumiativo sobre los eventos y crecimiento asociado a la ocurrencia de los eventos. Estas escalas presentan buenas propiedades psicometricas, evaluadas mediante indicadores de validez y fiabilidad. Los analisis posteriores confirman que la evaluacion de estas dimensiones contribuye de manera significativa a la explicacion del malestar de las personas mayores, aumentando la varianza explicada por otras dimensiones tradicionalmente consideradas en los modelos de estres. La consideracion de estas dimensiones, junto con otras variables como la evitacion experiencial, permite identificar perfiles de personas mayores en situacion de vulnerabilidad psicologica para el padecimiento de problemas psicologicos. Finalmente, el programa de intervencion descrito tiene efectos positivos y significativos sobre la disminucion de estrategias de regulacion emocional desadaptativas y el aumento de la utilizacion de estrategias de regulacion emocional adaptativas en las personas que participan en la intervencion. El programa consigue reducir significativamente los niveles de malestar de los participantes, lo que permite concluir que la intervencion basada en la Terapia de Aceptacion y Compromiso puede ser eficaz para ayudar a personas mayores que mantienen niveles significativos de malestar asociados a la perdida de un familiar en un intervalo temporal que sugiere que presentan un duelo complicado.",

      "title": "Demographic heterogeneity, cohort selection, and population growth",
      "abstract": "Demographic heterogeneity--variation among individuals in survival and reproduction--is ubiquitous in natural populations. Structured population models address heterogeneity due to age, size, or major developmental stages. However, other important sources of demographic heterogeneity, such as genetic variation, spatial heterogeneity in the environment, maternal effects, and differential exposure to stressors, are often not easily measured and hence are modeled as stochasticity. Recent research has elucidated the role of demographic heterogeneity in changing the magnitude of demographic stochasticity in small populations. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized effect: heterogeneous survival in long-lived species can increase the long-term growth rate in populations of any size. We illustrate this result using simple models in which each individual's annual survival rate is independent of age but survival may differ among individuals within a cohort. Similar models, but with nonoverlapping generations, have been extensively studied by demographers, who showed that, because the more \"frail\" individuals are more likely to die at a young age, the average survival rate of the cohort increases with age. Within ecology and evolution, this phenomenon of \"cohort selection\" is increasingly appreciated as a confounding factor in studies of senescence. We show that, when placed in a population model with overlapping generations, this heterogeneity also causes the asymptotic population growth rate lambda to increase, relative to a homogeneous population with the same mean survival rate at birth. The increase occurs because, even integrating over all the cohorts in the population, the population becomes increasingly dominated by the more robust individuals. The growth rate increases monotonically with the variance in survival rates, and the effect can be substantial, easily doubling the growth rate of slow-growing populations. Correlations between parent and offspring phenotype change the magnitude of the increase in lambda, but the increase occurs even for negative parent-offspring correlations. The effect of heterogeneity in reproductive rate on lambda is quite different: growth rate increases with reproductive heterogeneity for positive parent-offspring correlation but decreases for negative parent-offspring correlation. These effects of demographic heterogeneity on lambda have important implications for population dynamics, population viability analysis, and evolution.",

Morning types prefer morning hours for intellectual and physical activities while evening types feel and perform best at late afternoon or in the evening. This not only is a simple dichotomous classification but also can be viewed as a continuum. Individual differences in morningness–eveningness are an interesting facet of personality, but little is known about the relationship between psychological factors or health-related variables and morningness–eveningness in adolescents. In Study I, there were positive correlations between morningness and positive attitude towards life and a negative association between morningness and depression. In Study II, there were significant positive relationships between morningness and physical health, mental health, self-esteem, familial relationship, and school functioning. These results indicate that eveningness might be an unspecific risk factor for mental and physical health.",

      "abstract": "The developmental outcomes of only children in the US have been found to be greatly affected by 4 groups of factors: 1) the strong cultural expectation that only children are selfish, lonely and maladjusted. These beliefs can influence the judgments of observers and even cause the expected behavior. 2) The voluntariness of having a single child. In the past, Americans choosing to have 1 child were few and tended to be somewhat deviant. Women involuntarily having 1 child came from more traditional backgrounds and were unhappy because of their failure to fulfill their fertility desires. 3) the number of adults in the family unit. In the US the incidence of single parents is higher for 1-child families. The widely accepted confluence model of intellectual development suggests that the more adults and fewer children that live in the home, the greater the child's intellectual development. 4) The age of the child studied. It seems likely that the differences between only children and others vary according to the age of the child, and that maturation and family size have an interacting influence on social development. 3 recent studies have shown that only children in the US are advantaged in terms of educational attainment. 4 recent literature reviews have concluded that only children are no different from others in personality characteristics. They appear from research results to be no more lonely or maladjusted than other children, although they may be less sociable. The concept of selfishness is difficult to operationalize and measure objectively: the flawed studies attempting to do so have yielded mixed evidence regarding the selfishness of only children.",

Body image disturbance; awareness and Internalization of sociocultural messages regarding thinness; and sibling social comparisons were examined in 41 closest-in-age sisters through self-report questionnaires. Sisters showed similar levels of body image disturbance and sociocultural awareness and internalization. Sibling comparisons were negative for younger sisters but neutral or positive for older sisters. Sociocultural internalization predicted body dissatisfaction in both sisters, and body size distortion in younger sisters. Negative sibling comparisons during teenage years predicted body size distortion and body dissatisfaction in younger sisters, and preference for thinness in older sisters.",

This article reviews the literature on sexual differences for these variables and examines both absolute and relative differences to determine whether they are caused by the biological factor of sex or by cultural influences. The authors conclude that although physiological values for the average man are statistically different from the average woman, differences between any two individuals of the same sex are often greater. Even though sexual differences can be greatly reduced or eliminated by using relative values, their larger size gives men a practical physical advantage in many athletic and daily activities.",

      "abstract": "Modern society has given a lot of value to being slim and tall. This physical structure has been reinforced since childhood and has been affecting the adolescents desire to fit in this stereotype, especially the ones shown in the media. Because of this, health professionals are frequently questioned about the positive effects that physical exercises perform on children and adolescent’s linear growth. Through the specialized literature, this article intended to illustrate the main effects that physical exercise would perform on the secretion of growth hormone (GH) in the several body tissues during childhood and adolescence. Through this reviewing, it was possible to verify that physical exercises induce the stimulation of the GH/IGF-1 axis. Although much is speculated with regard to physical exercise and bone growth, no well-developed studies were found in the specific scientific literature to corroborate this statement. The adverse physical practicing effects during childhood and adolescence, apparently, were independent of the type of the exercise practice, but else a result of the intensity. The high training intensity seems to cause an important metabolic modulation with raise of the inflammatory markers and the suppression of the GH/ IGF-1 axis. However, it is important to emphasize that the sportive modality itself selects children and/or adolescents with lower stature as strategy for the attainment of better results in function of the mechanical facility of movements. Through this research, the performance of linear studies is evident, where individuals are followed before, during, and after exercise, with the determination of the training volume and intensity in order to reach definitive conclusions with regard to the effects on the final stature.",

The variability of feelings of shame among children and its relationship with food insecurity and happiness were assessed using questionnaires filled by children. The strongest feeling of shame in children was being seen naked in public (Shame-naked). Severe levels of shamefulness when others noticed the child's lack of available food (Shame-food) were correlated with higher food insecurity. Children that had an abnormally low Body Mass Index showed reduced shamefulness of Shame-naked. Maximum reported Shame-naked occurred at ages around puberty and girls reported more shamefulness than boys. Happiness was affected by aspects of food security of the child. Results suggest the existence of at least two types of shame that are affected in different ways by environmental conditions: Shame to be seen naked that is negatively correlated with Body Mass Index; and shame related to interactions with peers that correlates positively with Food Insecurity. This suggests that shame is an evolutionary adaptation, malleable by environmental conditions, fomenting fidelity among reproductive couples, stabilizing families in the long term and eventually enhancing trust and social cohesiveness.",

Finally, it is well recognized that obesity is a serious health concern for the individual as well as for society. However, what is less acknowledged is that the somatic as well as the psychosocial consequences of obesity also seem to differ between the two genders, and surprisingly, for some conditions and diseases, with more severe consequences for women than for men. This chapter describes the prevalence and distribution of body fat between men and women. It describes the different health consequences related to obesity and fat distribution for the two genders, and emphasizes that obesity has a bigger impact on somatic, psychologic and social well-being as well as reproduction in women compared to men.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake and Kingsley, 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviant is a formal violation of the rules. Although the wording of reactivists and normative definitions appear similar, each conceptualization focuses attention on very different aspects of deviance: the normative definitions focus on the person who engages in norm‐violating behavior while reactivist definitions focus on the social audiences that define deviants.",

      "title": "Against the Ugliness of Age: Towards an Erotics of the Aging Sexual Body",
      "abstract": "Within the heteronormative construction, older people are positioned as asexual, post-sexual or predatory on young bodies. Ageist assumptions deny their sexual desires exist at all or, if they are acknowledged, frame them within pathological medical, sexological and cultural discourses that characterize older sexual agency as grotesque, ugly, unattractive and sexually undesirable. These normative constructions have a negative impact on older sexual subjectivities. This article begins to develop a constructive representational form – or erotics - of aging sex and sexuality. Queer, as a deconstructionist, anti-foundational and anti-essential perspective, would seem the most prominent means by which to challenge pathologies of the ageing body and ageing sexuality. However, this discussion will suggest that there is both scope and limitations with regards to the ability of Queer critiques to undermine ageist erotophobia. Whilst queer proposes that we are free to construct and reconstruct our sexuality in multiple ways, our changing subjectivities are not just experienced emotionally and intra-psychically but are also bounded by our physicality. Our ageing corporeality prevents a constant and continuous reinvention of the sexual self. This does not preclude an erotics of age that -moves away from genito-centric and heteronormative/ homonormative constructions of sexuality and open up the potential for an erotic aged sex and sexual intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Associations between body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and relationship quality and other partner/relationship perceptions were investigated in 57 dating or married couples. Heavier women had lower quality relationships, which they predicted were more likely to end. They partnered with less desirable men and thought their partners would rate them as less warm/trustworthy. Heavier women were judged by their male partners as lower in attractiveness/vitality and as poorer matches to their partners' attractiveness ideals. In contrast, men's BMI was generally not associated with relationship functioning. These findings point to the potential mechanisms that may contribute to heavier women's relationship difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Teenagers make up a unique demographic in American society. By high school, most young people are making many decisions on their own: who their friends are, what cars they want to drive, how they will spend their Friday nights, where they will work, where they will go to college. Each of these decisions is, of course, shaped by outside forces such as school, family, and peer groups. However, perhaps the most difficult of these decisions are made with some of the least discussion, and are met with the most severe consequences. These are the decisions of body, sexuality, and sex. Most teenagers are faced with making sexual decisions in a vortex of misinformation, excitement, stigma, and fear. Society frowns upon teen sexuality, often meeting sexual discussion with avoidance or condemnation. Teens are not supposed to talk about sex; or if they talk about it, they are not supposed to have it; but if they have it, they are not supposed to do it outside of socially and morally acceptable standards. At a fundamental level, we as a society do not provide teens with complete information about sex and their bodies. We expect them to make choices without the necessary information, and the choices they make are often punished, in a framework of legal, social, and familial responsibility.",

      "abstract": "Since elderly people have their own attachment to vehicle operation, being involved naturally in their way of life, it is not easy for us to take a businesslike attitude like As your are old..., or It is the commonsense thing to.... Rather, some other data suggest that not few of them are convinced that themselves are the exceptions of rare isolated case. A conclusive factor of giving up driving may be out of their own judgement in an overwhelming majority; and yet it seems that the consciousness of declined eyesight could be a finishing blow whether they admit it or not. Although the advice of a doctor or a family member, or the result of a driving aptitude test may be considered a good means of becoming aware of one's limit of ability, it is more recommendable to resort to a counseling method such as let him experience the awakening of his present self approach, before attempting to persuade them straightforwardly or enumerating fragments of plausible explanation. Furthermore, some consider leaving everything until one will encounter an accident or become frightened/startled would be an effective approach. However, the thought itself is dangerous because a slight misstep will have a serious effect, this is matter of life and death. From now on, it is necessary to promote spread of driving aptitude tests. At the same time, a reasonable amount of consideration and thoughtfulness will be required on the part of examiners with regard to the manner and attitudes when conducting tests, as well as the method itself.

Calculating such measures requires accurate estimates of worklife expectancy. Here, worklife estimates for men and women in the USA categorized by educational attainment, race, marital status, parental status and current labour force status are presented. Race has a much larger impact on the worklife expectancy of men than women. Education is associated with larger worklife differentials for women. The association between marriage and worklife expectancy is significant, but of opposite sign, for men and women: married women (men) have a lower (higher) worklife expectancy than single women (men). Parenthood is associated with a reduction in the worklife expectancy of women; the association is smaller and varies from positive for some education/marital status groups to negative for others for men.",

      "abstract": "What, and how much, people eat is a response to their socio-political, socio-economic, socio-environmental and socio-cultural environments. Good nutrition is central to good health. Globally, health has improved for many but not for everyone equally. That food and nutrition-related health is unequally distributed is a marker of societal failure. For some individuals, communities and even nations, it is a matter of not having enough food, of being unable to afford food and there being little nutritious food readily available. For others there is an over abundance of food but its nutritional quality is compromised, access to healthy food is poor and cost of food is high relative to other commodities. Human development and poverty reduction in the Asia Pacific region cannot be achieved without improving nutrition in an equitable way. There is no biological reason for the scale of difference in health, including diet-related health that is observed in the Asia Pacific region. That it exists is unethical and inequitable. Asymmetric economic growth, unequal improvements in daily living conditions, unequal distribution of technical developments and suppression of human rights have seen health inequities perpetuate and worsen, particularly over the last three decades. Addressing diet-related health inequities requires attention to the underlying structural drivers and inequities in conditions of daily living that disempower individuals, social groups and even nations from the pursuit of good nutrition and health. These are matters of economic and social policy at the global, regional and national level.",

      "title": "The Persistence of Picky Eating: Opportunities to Improve Our Strategies and Messaging",
      "abstract": "Health providers, researchers, and parents do not yet have a handle on the management and messaging of picky eating in children. This is, in part, due to the lack of a precise and accepted definition of what constitutes picky eating. Moreover, the variation in those who persist in picky eating through developmental stages versus those who outgrow it has not been well studied. If picky eating is not a normative developmental event but rather an individual difference, recommendations for how to feed the picky eater may differ from those provided for typical eaters. One complicating factor is that what is common, as in a child's position on a normative developmental curve, or adaptive and desirable, as in normative standards,1 is poorly operationalized in terms of what constitutes picky eating. This leaves pediatricians at a loss and parents disconsolate.For example, the prevalence of picky eating can vary in the literature depending on how it is defined. When the definition is based on a \"somewhat\" response to the question \"Is your child a picky eater?\" the prevalence of picky eating can be as high as 50%.2 When more stringent and complex definitions are employed, the prevalence estimates are closer to 5%.3 The study by Fernandez et al4 in this issue of Pediatrics improves on this construct by using greater specificity to define picky eating. Via a person-centered approach, children were categorized into 3 groups (high, medium, and low) according to differences in their levels of food selectivity and its persistence over a 4-year period beginning at age 4. The findings in the current study confirm these previous differences in definition and the corresponding differences in prevalence that occur when these thresholds are altered. Taking a step back from these data reveals a crucial observation about picky eating: it is not normative, both in terms of frequency and adaptiveness. What does frequently occur is that children (and arguably adolescents and adults) are sometimes selective about the food they choose to eat. Also, this pattern is persistent and probably adaptive. Being cautious about food choices is probably wise given certain contexts and body states. However, when a parent describes a child as often or always selective, it is beyond normative, being neither common nor adaptive. Roughly only 14% were described this way, and its persistence across context and time may be associated with consequences, both psychosocial and otherwise. Future studies using this consistent definition are needed to confirm this hypothesis.This raises the next question: What is to be done? Perhaps the most significant finding from Fernandez et al4 is that interventions need to begin at younger ages because of the stability of picky eating trajectories overtime. For example, Cashdan5 suggested there is a sensitive period of development in which children are more receptive to the exploration of new tastes, perhaps because they are directly under the safe guidance of adult caregivers (eg, ≤24 months). This is obviously not to say that change cannot be implemented beyond that period, but it is more to emphasize that this is a developmental stage on which to capitalize.This study also provides important clues into what can be done during this developmental period and later developmental periods. Hughes et al6 argue that feeding styles explored in relation to picky eating are largely authoritarian rather than responsive. The authoritarian style is highly directive, lacks warmth, and tends to be punitive without consideration of the child's individual needs or context. In contrast, the indulgent style is extremely sensitive to the child's individual needs and context, but it lacks structure and authority. An authoritative feeding style combines attributes from both, having parent structure and guidance while being sensitive to the child's needs without being punitive. Examining the impact of an authoritative feeding style on food exploration across levels of picky eating is a priority for future research. This is particularly true given the consistent finding in this study and others that children who are higher in picky eating are also higher in emotional lability and lower in emotion regulation. Although it is imperative that humans develop a sophisticated system of discerning which foods are safe and which substances should not be ingested,7 children who are high in emotional lability may also be more sensitive to threatening messages in the environment (eg, social cues of distaste, talk of healthy versus nonhealthy foods). Thus, well-intended guidance may have inadvertant consequences, creating a context that treats foods as potentially hazardous rather than pleasurable.Findings from Fernandez et al,4 knowledge of fear learning,8 and curiosity about strategies to increase pleasure9 can be used to guide hypotheses about future directions for research and provide some immediate suggestions for parents. According to theories of inhibitory learning, memories of previous fearful events are not erased with new information,8 but rather, new memories that minimize threats compete with older memories to help individuals form new conclusions. In the context of feeding style, we can think of children with elevated picky eating as having thousands of negative memories about food (eg, conflict, unexpected tastes, discomfort). Thus, caregivers can work to create positive memories and experiences around food (eg, cooking, gardening) to help picky eaters expand their preferences. However, in doing so, it is critical that caregivers let go of their need for a child to taste something and instead focus on accumulating pleasant experiences. By minimizing the focus on outcomes (ie, child tries a food) in favor of building a pleasurable memory, children high in pickiness as well as emotional lability may begin to relax in the presence of food without worrying that their parents have an ulterior motive.10 Whether this approach eventually reduces pickiness is worth investigating; in the interim, it provides concrete objectives for parents, may reduce ineffective and resource-intensive feeding strategies, and overall, can ameliorate the shared eating experience.",

Thus, we hypothesized that a low capacity to self-protect leads to a biased social categorization of others as harmful. To examine this hypothesis, silhouettes of the human body, which had a sexually dimorphic cue (waist-to-hip ratio), were presented, and participants categorized the stimuli as female or male. Participants’ basic physical fitness was measured, and we manipulated physical load by a heavy or light backpack. Physical load did not significantly influence categorization. In contrast, only female participants tended to categorize the stimuli as male as basic physical fitness increased, suggesting that basic physical fitness, not physical load, affects sex categorization for females. Our findings shed new light on the effect of fitness factors on social cognition.",

These influences can be summarized as a correlation between parents' and children's frailty. It is shown that even if children perfectly inherit their frailty from their parents, parents' life spans explain little of the variance in children's life spans, because the variance in life expectancies among people with different frailties is small compared with the variance in life spans among people at the same level of frailty. By interpreting frailty as a relative risk in a proportional-hazard model, longevity as a duration or waiting time, and inheritance as an invariance in relative risk over time, one can extend this result to repeatable events involving fertility, migration, marriage, unemployment, and so forth.",

      "title": "[Psychosociology of the demand for abortion].",
      "abstract": "3 preliminary observations are relevant to an analysis of the psychosociology of abortion. All pregnancies, regardless of the outcome, are meaningful for the woman and/or the couple. On the other hand, the debate for or against abortion is meaningless to the extent that most women seeking abortions are to some degree \"against\" abortion. Finally, beyond a certain point the use of contraception and the demand for abortion are not related, as shown by the stability of abortion rates in France over the past 20 years during which rates of contraceptive usage changed greatly and by the high level of contraceptive information among women seeking repeat abortions. In the psychic realm, being pregnant is positive if only as a indication of the power to become pregnant. It is known that women suffering a recent loss are more likely to become pregnant. PRegnancy under circumstances of loss or mourning signifies that something other than death or loss is possible. The idea of pregnancy as a compensation for loss can refer to a range of situations such as death of a close relative, end of a union, divorce, unemployment, or educational or professional failure, to name a few. The unconscious utilization of pregnancy as a proof of power can be repeated each time doubt arises as to the reality of this power. Not pregnancy, but bringing a child into the world is what is impossible in voluntary pregnancy termination. Abortion is chosen because it allows the mother or the couple to avoid an investment for which they are unprepared. Becoming a mother means to stop being a child and also forces an encounter with the images of one's own parents internalized during childhood. Such images are not always good, which caused problems in the psychic work of identification with the parent that accompanies childbirth. Choosing to have a child and joining the chain of generations is impossible for some persons, because the filiation is too difficult or the parental images are too negative. Abortions, like the occurrence of the pregnancies that lead to them, are always meaningful, although their significance may not be consciously grasped by the woman. On the societal level, abortion may signal resistance to the medicalization and perhaps politicization of sexuality. The perceived high economic cost of children and desire to provide them with abundance may be other factors in the demand for abortion. To some degree children are now valued by society primarily as a potential market. Study of the origins of abortion is not specific, but fundamental to an understanding of human reproduction in general.",

Ces jeunes expriment une absence d’appétit de l’autre qui va de pair avec l’abstinence sexuelle que leur retrait oblige.

Ces conduites interrogent les rapports de genre et la distribution des rôles au sein de la famille. À partir d’entretiens et d’observations, à domicile et dans des structures de soin, cet article montre que ces corps adolescents invisibilisés par l’enfermement ou l’extrême maigreur sont paradoxalement une expression ostentatoire d’une dépossession de soi.

      "abstract": "Abstract Fecundity is defined as the ability to produce children, and is thus important to any discussion concerning reproduction and family size. While couples may have the ability to produce children, fecundity can be constrained by both fertility intentions and broader social forces, such as marital trends and labor force attachment. Alongside these factors, researchers are increasingly interested in factors negatively impacting biological fecundity. Couples who attempt to but do not become pregnant within a year of time to pregnancy are considered subfecund or fecundity‐impaired.",

      "abstract": "Many factors contribute to the development of eating disorders and body image problems, including our society's emphasis on body perfection. For a long time the Anorexia Association of South Australia has witnessed individuals who have suffered the ensuing injustice. We have seen this widespread preoccupation with body size and shape reflected in anorexia, bulimia and a range of food and weight issues for both men and women. Increasingly, we are finding that people are also feeling vulnerable to the cult of cosmetic surgery. Perhaps people who access our association are more likely to talk about body image issues, so we hear about their issues with cosmetic surgery. However, our society is being sold the belief that the normal body is somehow diseased and in need of care. More than ever, this prompts our association to create awareness that body image problems do not originate and reside within particular individuals who are somehow disordered. Rather, they are created and encouraged by injustices in our society. (author abstract)",

In this sense, hair extension comes to supply the lack of hair, increasing self-esteem and filling the emotional void caused by the fall. Alopecia or hair loss, as it is popularly known, is caused by several factors, such as hormonal dysfunction, stress, lack of vitamins such as iron, zinc and vitamin D, chemicals, genetic predisposition and trauma generated by traction over long periods. . The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits and harms of the use of hair extension, since it may be related to the development of traction alopecia, as its use can be done improperly, the maintenance time is not respected and the amount of hair to be longer than natural hair can support. However, it is necessary to study the structural composition of the hair shaft, as well as its chemical and physical composition. Knowledge of the hair cycle: anagen phase, catagen phase and telogen phase, each with its own duration. And especially the understanding of traction alopecia, its possible causes and how it can be avoided. Photos of customers who have been using hair extensions for some time, showing that the extension does not damage natural wires, on the contrary, it helps in their healthy development.",

Feared retaliation, perceived stigmatization, desire not to leave home and protect wrong doer and difficulty in communicating, are close similarities with child abuse. Grave difference is that death of older person is rarely scrutinized carefully. It is regardless of risk factors of possible abuse or neglect as it is for children and younger victims of sexual and domestic violence, who are healthy and unexpected to die. Additional differences include old age often bringing medical and physiological attributes that mimics or masks, markers of elder abuse and neglect, further complicating analysis and detection. Elderly have multiple medical problems and dependencies, misguiding assumption that these are prone to stressors causing natural death. Factually, older persons have fewer support systems and reserves—physical, psychological, and economic, magnifying impact of abuse and neglect. A single mistreatment is more likely to trigger a downward spiral, leading to dependency, serious complicating illness and even death.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to younger groups, research with the elderly suggest a predominantly present-focused temporal orientation. One aspect of satisfaction, optimism is conceptualized as a form of future perspective. Health psychology generally asserts that health-enhancing messages depend for effect on a person perceiving future benefits to actions taken in the present to enhance health or minimize ill-health risk. The extent to which the elderly perceive or value the future should impact on health maintenance behaviors. In a study of eighty-six elderly people, the dominant ways of viewing time coalesced around a variety of present time perspectives. Within-group differences revealed that as people aged, they became less satisfied with life relative to their level of optimism. For the young-old, optimism was positively correlated with satisfaction, but for the oldest-old the variables were negatively associated. Optimism increased with age while satisfaction decreased with age. The decrease in satisfaction is most probably related more to a sense of realism about the tasks of aging than a sense of “death anxiety,” or avoidance of the future. As people age, temporal variables become less important in predicting optimism or satisfaction and optimism becomes less important as a predictor of satisfaction. Implications for developing models of health management in the elderly are discussed.",

      "title": "Confusing Food with Obesity",
      "abstract": "Marion Nestle's Editorial “The ironic politics of obesity” (Special Issue on Obesity, 7 Feb., p. [781][1]) makes a number of good points related to obesity. Certainly, many people eat more than they need to, and adequate incomes and food supplies to enable eating too much can lead to obesity. This is especially true when exercise or physical work is reduced or virtually eliminated from daily routines. However, the Editorial does not adequately emphasize a number of other points. For example, in discussing obesity, there is a tendency to confuse “overweight” and obesity.\n\nUsing the arbitrary and rather simplistic scale of the Body Mass Index (BMI), a BMI of 18 to 25 is considered acceptable, a BMI of about 25 to 28 is considered to demonstrate that a person is “overweight,” and a BMI of 29 or higher indicates an “obese” person. Because the BMI formula of weight in kilograms divided by height in centimeters squared is a “one size fits all” formula, it does not take account of differences in gender or body frame.\n\nThe Special Issue calls attention to a situation in the United States and many other countries that needs greater attention. Obesity has been linked, using mainly epidemiological data, with increased rates of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. At the same time, demographic data in most countries show that populations that may have more obese people than in previous years are living longer and generally healthier lives. The diseases that have been linked to obesity are generally problems of older age and tend to occur whether or not a person is obese.\n\nNot having enough to eat on a regular basis is a much larger worldwide nutritional problem than obesity, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that more than 800 million people in the world, including hundreds of millions of infants and children, do not get enough to eat each day to meet their needs for energy, growth, or micronutrients. The number of undernourished globally is at least four times greater than the number of obese. Undernutrition has enormous population-wide consequences and is far more damaging to national economies than the negative implications of obesity. Obesity concerns divert resources from food security to cover costs of treatment for cardiovascular disease or diabetes treatment, and detract from efforts to assure better and adequate food supplies for all ([1][2], [2][3]).\n\nThe need to stop confusing food with obesity is especially critical in attempting to solve problems of obesity. Taxes on some food categories, changes in political campaign laws, and advertising restrictions are all political, not scientific, approaches to the problem of obesity, especially among children, and they will fail. It is the public health sector that must provide the leadership in promoting better food supplies, food consumption habits, science-based and food-based nutrition education, and physical activity as the cornerstones for confronting and correcting current nutritional problems.\n\n1. 1.[↵][4] 1.

      "abstract": "Individual differences in morningness/eveningness are relatively stable over time and, in part, genetically based. The night-owl pattern is more prevalent in men than in women, particularly after puberty and before women reach menopause. It has been suggested that eveningness evolved relatively recently in human evolutionary history and that this trait may be advantageous to individuals pursuing short-term mating strategies. Consistent with this hypothesis, eveningness is associated with extraversion, novelty-seeking, and in males, with a higher number of sexual partners. In this study, I investigated whether eveningness is associated with short-term relationship orientation, higher risk-taking, and higher testosterone or cortisol. Both female and male night-owls were more likely to be single than in long-term relationships than early morning individuals. Eveningness was associated with higher risk-taking in women but not in men; this association was not testosterone-dependent but mediated by cortisol. Female night-owls had average cortisol profiles and risk-taking tendencies more similar to those of males than to those of early-morning females. Taken together, these findings provide some support to the hypothesis that eveningness is associated with psychological and behavioral traits that are instrumental in short-term mating strategies, with the evidence being stronger for women than for men.",

By unbelief is meant the initial reluctance to accept the doctrines of Christianity as well as the disinclination to retain them that often comes upon those who devote themselves to an intellectual life. This unbelief occurs especially during the formative period, usually, but not necessarily, the years spent by young people at a university, or the time immediately following. The purpose of this essay is to try to isolate the various elements in modern life that tend to disturb settled faith in Christianity, and very briefly to indicate some way of trying to counteract them. Many of the causes are common to all periods of history, some are proper to our own age or have unusual strength now. This account does not pretend to be more than a limited and partial sketch. Behind every problem of modern instability there lies, first, a fundamental insecurity in social life, affecting all of us in many and sometimes unsuspected ways. This insecurity is manifested in the multiplicity and diversity of moral and political, personal and emotional standards all round ; these react in their turn to make more acute the basic insecurity in the soul—it may sometimes amount to a positive fear of life.",

      "abstract": "El genero de la descendencia humana y animal ha sido una de las preocupaciones mas recurrentes de la humanidad a lo largo de la historia. En produccion animal, el sexo es considerado como el factor genetico mas importante.\r\nVarios estudios han observado una interaccion entre caracteristicas o condiciones maternas o paternas y la proporcion de sexos secundaria. De este modo, se ha\r\nsugerido que algunas caracteristicas maternas, como la condicion corporal, la dieta, los niveles de glucosa, el estatus de dominancia, los niveles de testosterona, el estres,la edad, el numero de parto y el tamano de camada, y algunos parametros ligados a la hembra tales como el momento de inseminacion, el lado de ovulacion, la exposicion a contaminantes y la temperatura ambiental, pueden alterar la proporcion de sexos.Debido a la complejidad de las relaciones entre las diferentes variables que pueden influir en la proporcion de sexos de la descendencia, estas observaciones y las hipotesis a las que dan lugar son bastante especulativas sin una base molecular o fisiologica. Los mecanismos responsables de un sesgo en la proporcion de sexos pueden ocurrir en dos momentos distintos: antes de la fecundacion (mecanismos\r\npreconcepcionales) o despues de la fecundacion (mecanismos postconcepcionales).Desde un punto de vista evolutivo, los mecanismos que actuan tempranamente (antes\r\no alrededor de la concepcion) serian mas ventajosos que aquellos que aquellos que actuan posteriormente, ya que estos ultimos provocan mayores perdidas al implicar la\r\nperdida de embriones o fetos y una correspondiente perdida de fertilidad. El objetivo general de la presente tesis es analizar los posibles mecanismos preconceptuales de\r\ncontrol de la proporcion de sexos y determinar las diferencias fisiologicas, transcripcionales y epigeneticas entre embriones preimplantacionales bovinos de\r\ndistinto sexo. Los mecanismos preconcepcionales se pueden dividir en dos grupos. El primero implica una supuesta seleccion espermatica llevada a cabo por el ovocito que\r\npuede alterar la igualdad de oportunidades de fecundacion entre los espermatozoides X o Y. El segundo se basa en unas supuestas diferencias intrinsecas entre espermatozoides X o Y, que podrian alterar la equidad de probabilidades de alcanzar el lugar de la fecundacion entre espermatozoides X o Y. En esta tesis, se discute la posibilidad del primer supuesto.",

Religious beliefs and ethnic origins do not significantly affect trust. The latter result may be an indication that the American melting pot at least up to a point works, in terms of homogenizing attitudes of different cultures, even though racial cleavages leading to low trust are still quite high.",

      "abstract": "Public opinion about neonaticide (the killing of a newborn within the first 24 hours of life) has varied across time and cultures. Some nations have passed legislation on behalf of maternal offenders with the assumption that childbirth, a time of unique biological change, may lead to mental disturbance. The United States, however, makes no such distinction; offenders are prosecuted under general homicide laws. Nevertheless, U.S. courts often consider a mother's emotional and physical condition prior to and during delivery. This study includes 44 female offenders and 45 infant deaths and highlights society's ambivalence toward neonaticide offenders. The authors suggest that this ambivalence may be attributed to: (1) the perception that an offender's emotional and physical turmoil during the birth and homicide reduces her culpability; (2) the sentiment that neonaticide offenders are more \"redeemable\" than other offenders; and (3) the uncertainty about the personhood of a fetus or newborn.",

      "abstract": "By definition, aging is a natural, gradual and continuous process. On the other hand, frailty reflects the increase in vulnerability to stressors and shortens the time without disease (health span) while longevity refers to the length of life (lifespan). The average life expectancy has significantly increased during the last few decades. A longer lifespan has been accompanied by an increase in frailty and decreased independence in older adults, with major differences existing between men and women. For example, women tend to live longer than men but also experience higher rates of frailty and disability. Sex differences prevent optimization of lifestyle interventions and therapies to effectively prevent frailty. Sex differences in frailty and aging are rooted in a complex interplay between uncontrollable (genetic, epigenetic, physiological), and controllable factors (psychosocial and lifestyle factors). Thus, understanding the underlying causes of sex differences in frailty and aging is essential for developing personalized interventions to promote healthy aging and improve quality of life in older men and women. In this review, we have discussed the key contributors and knowledge gaps related to sex differences in aging and frailty.",

      "title": "Assessing animal welfare at the farm level: do we care sufficiently about the individual?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Animal welfare is generally referred to as the quality of an animal's life as experienced by the individual animal. On-farm welfare assessment, however, usually relies on both individual and group measures. As regards the latter, individual animals are not identified (eg incidence of stereotypic behaviour in a pen) or features of the whole group (eg score obtained from qualitative behaviour assessment) are used. This raises the question whether our current approaches to on-farm assessment sufficiently consider the individual nature of animal welfare. Measures assessed at the group level bear the disadvantage that distribution across group members may be skewed and the most affected individuals are not necessarily identified. However, the importance of knowing about the welfare state of individual animals depends on the purpose of the assessment. If the primary aim is farm assurance, the individual animal is of lesser importance, but non-compliance with thresholds at herd/farm level or comparison with peer farms may induce change. Using individual measures in a sample of animals means that animals not sampled but requiring intervention, eg for treatment of lameness, would have to be identified subsequently. Measures truly taken at the group level make individual interventions difficult, but interventions implemented at the group level (eg reducing stocking density) do not necessarily require information on the individual animal. Automatic detection of welfare-relevant states has received increased attention and identifying individual animals with impaired welfare seems to be promising. Automated early detection of problems may also reduce the ethical dilemma that traditional assessments at the end of the production cycle, eg in broiler chickens, may identify welfare impairments but not directly benefit the affected animals. Reflection on individual and group measures and their consequences for animal welfare may help in interpreting the outcomes of the assessments and stimulate future developments in the field.",

      "title": "Reforming Juvenile Justice: A Developmental Approach",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a distinct, yet transient, period of development between childhood and adulthood characterized by increased experimentation and risk-taking, a tendency to discount long-term consequences, and heightened sensitivity to peers and other social influences. A key function of adolescence is developing an integrated sense of self, including individualization, separation from parents, and personal identity. Experimentation and novelty-seeking behavior, such as alcohol and drug use, unsafe sex, and reckless driving, are thought to serve a number of adaptive functions despite their risks. Research indicates that for most youth, the period of risky experimentation does not extend beyond adolescence, ceasing as identity becomes settled with maturity. Much adolescent involvement in criminal activity is part of the normal developmental process of identity formation and most adolescents will mature out of these tendencies. Evidence of significant changes in brain structure and function during adolescence strongly suggests that these cognitive tendencies characteristic of adolescents are associated with biological immaturity of the brain and with an imbalance among developing brain systems. This imbalance model implies dual systems: one involved in cognitive and behavioral control and one involved in socio-emotional processes. Accordingly adolescents lack mature capacity for self-regulations because the brain system that influences pleasure-seeking and emotional reactivity develops more rapidly than the brain system that supports self-control. This knowledge of adolescent development has underscored important differences between adults and adolescents with direct bearing on the design and operation of the justice system, raising doubts about the core assumptions driving the criminalization of juvenile justice policy in the late decades of the 20th century. It was in this context that the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) asked the National Research Council to convene a committee to conduct a study of juvenile justice reform. The goal of Reforming Juvenile Justice: A Developmental Approach was to review recent advances in behavioral and neuroscience research and draw out the implications of this knowledge for juvenile justice reform, to assess the new generation of reform activities occurring in the United States, and to assess the performance of OJJDP in carrying out its statutory mission as well as its potential role in supporting scientifically based reform efforts.",

Males are more likely to exhibit risky behaviour than females. Although minor or infrequent antisocial acts may be frequent in adolescence, not all adolescents get involved, and many do not get involved a lot. The most powerful predictors from middle childhood to chronic delinquency in adolescence are: troublesomeness in school; hyperactivity/poor concentration; low intelligence and poor attainment; family criminality; family poverty; and poor parenting. Social control theory argues that antisocial behaviour is less likely when the young person has a stake in social institutions such as the family, school, or clubs and societies.",

      "abstract": "Ageism refers to discrimination and prejudice based on age-related stereotypes. Forms of prejudice such as sexism and racism have been investigated in relation to morality; however, little extant research has considered ageism and moral identity. The purpose of this study was to investigate, among younger adults, whether moral identity symbolization – that is, the desire to appear moral to others (i.e., public morality) – and/or moral identity internalization – that is, wanting to be more moral (i.e., private morality) – was associated with ageism among younger adults. College students, ages 18–29 (N = 688, 75.00% female) enrolled in a psychology course at a large public university in the southern U.S. completed a survey which included the Self-Importance of Moral Identity Scale and Fabroni Scale of Ageism. Men had higher levels of ageism than women. Moral identity symbolization was not associated with ageism; however, moral identity internalization was associated with lower ageism. Results regarding gender are consistent with previous studies finding greater intolerance among men. Among younger adults, moral identity symbolization may not be related to ageism since attitudes about older adults are not germane to public morality the way racism or sexism are. Younger adults who internalize their moral identity – that is, they wish to be a more moral person – may engage in less stereotyping and prejudice towards older adults.",

But of the young adult, in Western democracies at least, all these activities and more are expected. 'In all societies', Whiting and Child' report, 'the helpless infant, getting his food by nursing at his mother's breast and, having digested it, freely evacuating the waste products, exploring his genitals, biting and kicking at will, must be changed into a responsible adult obeying the rules of his society.' This change involves the concept of socialization, which Child2 defines as 'the whole process by which an individual, born with behavioural potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behaviour which is confined within a much narrower range-the range of what is customary and acceptable to him according to the standards of his group'. If we examine this generally accepted definition, however, we observe that it views the process of socialization as being predominantly if not entirely uni-directional: the child 'is led to develop'; he is therefore passive and acted upon. The inference to be drawn here is not the reverse-that the child moulds his environment. This is patently false. But there is also something false, even if in a more subtle way with the statement that the environment moulds the child. Instead we advance the view that there is a mutual interaction",

      "title": "Tall Stature",
      "abstract": "Tall stature is rarely pathologic, but the pediatric health care clinician must be able to distinguish familial causes from those due to endocrine or genetic reasons. Defined as a height 2 SDs above the mean for age and sex or greater than the 95th percentile, tall stature is usually familial or secondary to obesity. Although there is known psychological stigma associated with short stature, the paucity of evidence that tall stature in females or males is psychologically detrimental makes the previous practice of sex hormone administration to decrease ultimate adult height no longer acceptable.When evaluating tall stature, it is first necessary to plot serial height measurements during multiple visits. If these measurements confirm the criteria for tall stature, the clinician should calculate the child’s projected adult height by calculating the midparental height as follows:Parental heights should be measured directly because self-reported heights are often overestimated, especially in men. If a child has at least one tall parent and plots within 5 cm of the target adult height range, he/she is considered to have familial, or constitutional, tall stature. In this circumstance, no further investigation is warranted as long as the child is developing normally and has normal physical examination findings. Measurement of body proportions is also important, including upper body to lower body ratios and arm span, because these measures can help differentiate between pathologic and familial tall stature. At birth, the upper extremity to lower extremity ratio should be 1.7. By early childhood, this proportion should be 0.89 to 0.95. In addition, a child’s arm span is generally 1 cm shorter than his height, whereas an adolescent’s arm span is generally equal to his height. Klinefelter syndrome should be considered in a patient with tall stature, increased arm span, sparse hair, small testes, and a high-pitched voice, predicating the need for karyotype testing. A tall patient with decreased upper to lower body segment ratio, hyperextensible joints, and scoliosis may have Marfan syndrome.If pathologic tall stature is suspected, a bone age radiograph of left hand, fingers, and wrist should be ordered. A normal bone age is consistent with familial tall stature, whereas accelerated bone age in a nonobese child must lead the pediatrician to consider precocious puberty or growth hormone excess. Obesity leads to tall stature in childhood with a normal final adult height and is associated with accelerated skeletal maturation. Although the exact mechanism for obesity’s role in tall stature is not understood, the hormone ghrelin, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, insulin-like growth factors, and insulin all have the potential to mediate linear growth.In conjunction with bone age, precocious puberty can be diagnosed with Tanner staging and assessing testicular volume in males, with a postpubertal testicular volume being greater than 4 mL. Patients with late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia present with precocious puberty, tall stature, and an increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone level in the blood. Growth hormone excess is rare in children, yet when present is usually due to pituitary adenomas. Growth hormone excess before epiphyseal fusion results in tall stature and markedly increased height velocity. If it occurs after epiphyseal fusion, adolescents may also have signs of acromegaly, such as coarsening of facial features, enlarged jaw, and distal body overgrowth, including large hands and feet.There are other rare genetic syndromes associated with tall stature, all of which have significant clinical stigmata that should be apparent on physical examination. Sotos syndrome should be considered if the bone age is accelerated and the child has accompanying symptoms of facial flushing, frontal bossing, and a narrow face and head. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is considered if hypoglycemia is present at birth, along with anterior abdominal wall defects and macroglossia. Marshall-Smith syndrome is associated with unusually rapid physical growth, abnormal facies, and respiratory issues.A pediatric health care professional can diagnose most causes of tall stature with a careful history and physical examination. If suspicion is high for disease or the cause is unclear, the clinician should consider radiographic bone age and focused laboratory testing. Although the social stigma behind tall stature has decreased, clinicians must still be aware of potential pathologic causes of tall stature that would warrant intervention.Comments: This In Brief emphasizes the importance of accurate height measurements. My experience is that height measurement can often be inaccurate, especially in supine measurements in young children or very active children who have difficulty standing still. When transitioning from supine measurements to standing measurements in toddlers, there may appear to be a false perception of a decrease in height because standing height is often shorter than supine length. Accurate measurement of upper to lower body segment ratios is important in identifying several syndromes and can be performed in the following way. To measure lower body segment, measure from the symphysis pubis of the patient to the floor. The upper segment can be calculated by subtracting the lower segment from the total height. Measurement of arm span is best accomplished by measuring from the tip of the middle finger of one hand, with arms outstretched at a 90° angle to the tip of the middle finger of the other hand.A recent study of self-reported adult height measurements in parents found that men have a tendency to overestimate their heights but women’s self-report is more accurate. When looking at estimating the other parent’s height, women were more likely to overestimate the men’s height, whereas men were more accurate in estimating women’s height. Their conclusions were that attempts should be made to use measured heights of parents when the results would have an effect on diagnostic workup or treatment of patients with tall stature.",

Interview data from eight men who had experienced gender atypical sexual development were analysed using the framework of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.

Emotional distress was most keenly felt when doubt was cast upon the men’s identity as sexually mature males. The extent to which absent sexual development was conspicuous or visible appeared to be an important factor in negative experiences.",

The term relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) only broadens the potential impact of low energy availability compared to the Triad, but it also allows the syndrome to be applied to male athletes who may also experience a number of the same physiological consequences. One of the main reasons for the development of the RED-S framework is to ensure that research in males at risk or with low energy availability is increased. The Female Athlete Triad provides a medical framework that describes three inter-related conditions that each exist on a continuum from normal/optimal to serious endpoints. Despite there being a lack of research around RED-S, the concept has most certainly raised awareness in the running and coaching community of the health and performance consequences of low energy availability.",

      "abstract": "In adolescence, the system of values, the ways to find pleasure, the experience of being loved, being a male or a female, are put to the test due to the presence of sexually mature body. In many cases, what goes relatively smoothly in normal development can be stressful for some adolescents. Despite that, adolescents find ways to respond and to use their experiences constructively, in an effort and with a desire to enter the social and sexual world of adults. Still, there are adolescents whose experiences are completely different and whose adolescence is riddled with problems. They live haunted by their own fantasies and no matter how much they try to keep the cause of suffering or hatred outside themselves, they inevitably face the experience of their bodies being the source of abnormality and of not being able to do much else but giving in to illness. Crucial change that should take place in adolescence for an individual to reach psychic maturity is the weakening of relations with primary objects, which enables the creation of new object relations. In self-harming adolescents, however, there is inability to give up the bond with the mother - any internal attempt to break this bond brings the feeling of unbearable loss. Basically, the adolescent's relationship with their mother is highly ambivalent, and the feelings fluctuate from intense hatred to intense love. Careful monitoring brings up the conclusion that these are narcissistic personalities with primitive and punishing superego. In this article, we have used the psychoanalytic theoretical concepts as a basis for understanding the psychopathology and psychodynamics of adolescents whose act of intentional and conscious attacking of one's own body is one of the main reasons for seeking psychiatric help, which will be illustrated by presenting individual and milieu therapy of an adolescent girl treated at the Day Hospital for Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health.",

The impact of the agent depends on host factors and the influence of physical, biological, and social factors in the environment. For nutritional disorders those of the social environment, including the complex of educational, economic, religious, political, and other factors, are likely to be the most important and also the most difficult to understand and modify. If nutritional and other diseases are viewed as problems in human ecology, the primary health-care approach to their prevention follows naturally.",

Twenty-six older women were intensively interviewed; none had experienced a recent loss or terminal illness. Many wanted to understand their place in the order of things and were not looking to organized religion for answers. Dominant themes that emerged from the interviews included: a need to feel connected; spiritual questioning; existential angst; thoughts about death and dying; and, to a lesser degree, reliance on organized religion. Some older women—African Americans, Latinas, and women of lower socioeconomic status—turned to the Bible, prayer, and Church for answers to their questions, but most did not. These data suggest that spiritual questioning—independent of organized religion, significant loss, or impending death—is a natural part of the aging process as one approaches the end of the life span.",

      "abstract": "Although bisexual men report lower levels of mental health relative to gay men, few studies have examined the factors that contribute to bisexual men's mental health. Bisexual men are less likely to disclose, and more likely to conceal (i.e., a desire to hide), their sexual orientation than gay men. Theory suggests that this may adversely impact their mental health. This report examined the factors associated with disclosure and with concealment of sexual orientation, the association of disclosure and concealment with mental health, and the potential mediators (i.e., internalized homophobia, social support) of this association with mental health.An ethnically diverse sample of 203 non-gay-identified, behaviorally bisexual men who do not disclose their same-sex behavior to their female partners were recruited in New York City to complete a single set of self-report measures.Concealment was associated with higher income, a heterosexual identification, living with a wife or girlfriend, more frequent sex with women, and less frequent sex with men. Greater concealment, but not disclosure to friends and family, was significantly associated with lower levels of mental health. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that both internalized homophobia and general emotional support significantly mediated the association between concealment and mental health.The findings demonstrate that concealment and disclosure are independent constructs among bisexual men. Further, they suggest that interventions addressing concerns about concealment, emotional support, and internalized homophobia may be more beneficial for increasing the mental health of bisexual men than those focused on promoting disclosure.",

The emerging gender difference (more girls depressed than boys) in depressed mood and depressive disorders appears after the age of 13 years or midpuberty. Currently, little evidence supports that biological factors are an explanation. Genetic factors are associated more strongly with depression among pubertal girls than boys. Regarding cognitive factors, ruminative response style, but not dysfunctional attitudes or attributional style, has been supported to be a possible explanation. Studies on childhood adversities and gender role have provided evidence explaining why more girls are depressed than boys. Girls are more likely to experience negative events in the family than boys, and these adversities are in turn associated with elevated depression. Girls identify more strongly with a feminine stereotype of needing to appear thin and consequently become more dissatisfied with their body shape and physical appearance, which in turn is associated with increased depression.",

This study assessed the differences in self-perceived health status between gay adolescent males and their heterosexual counterparts. A national nonrepresentative sample of 5,602 Indian and Native adolescent males was surveyed about issues of sexual behavior, physical and sexual abuse, mental health status, substance use, attitudes about school, participation in violence, and access to health care. Results indicate that there were no real differences between gay and heterosexual male respondents for substance use or attitudes about school. Statistically significant differences were found, however, in areas of mental health, as well as physical and sexual abuse. Gay adolescents were twice as likely to have thought of or attempted suicide. Gay adolescents were twice as likely to have been physically abused and nearly six times more likely to have been sexually abused. Gay American Indian or Alaska Native adolescent males constitute a very vulnerable population and are clearly in need of targeted health and social services. Unfortunately, the benefits seen by adults of the \"two-spirited\" gay and lesbian American Indian movement have not been accessible to Indian and Native adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Engagement in occupation is as an innate behaviour; an integral and defining aspect of human-ness. The notion of humans as occupational beings endowed with capacities which depend on many complex sub-systems, such as the physical, socio-cultural and transcendental, is central to our understanding. The participation in complex, skilled activities within the domains of self-care, leisure and work is seen as health giving and sustaining. Without this engagement, their health and well-being might be negatively affected. Occupational deprivation is a state of long-lasting exclusion from meaningful occupations, due to circumstances beyond the control of the individual.\nIt is proposed here that present research interest into the specific effects of deprivation may yet take too little account of the situation faced by individuals with complex neurological disabilities who are living within very supportive environments, but nevertheless experiencing a form of deprivation. This paper explores some issues from the literature around occupational deprivation linked to intrinsic causes. Realisation of the negative effects of deprivation might lead to more sustained effort in at least, enhancing opportunities for engagement in enjoyable activities.",

These variables are not clear and distinct confounders of the weightmortality relationship in the same sense as cigarette smoking. Rather, they have complex interrelationships with body weight, and the causal pathways are unclear.

      "abstract": "Abstract Economists increasingly recognise the importance of personality traits for socio-economic outcomes, but little is known about the stability of these traits over the life cycle. Existing empirical contributions typically focus on age patterns and disregard cohort and period influences. This paper contributes novel evidence for the separability of age, period and cohort effects for a broad range of personality traits based on systematic specification tests for disentangling age, period and cohort influences. Our estimates document that, for different cohorts, the evolution of personality traits across the life cycle follows a stable, though non-constant, age profile, while there are sizeable differences across time periods.",

      "abstract": "Longitudinal weight records for 360 boys and 345 girls from birth to young adulthood are used. The Count-Gompertz growth curve is fitted to individual growth records in order to characterize individual body weight growth. The authors present the mean-constant growth curves of boys and girls divided by weight at the peak weight velocity for boys and girls, and also girls are subdivided by their weight at menarche. Adult weight has no simple relationship with the timing of adolescence and menarcheal age. Adult weight is, nevertheless, negatively correlated with the timing of adolescence (or menarcheal age) when weight at the timing of adolescence (or menarcheal weight) and/or age at growth completion are held constant. Age at growth completion also negatively correlated with weight at menarche when adult weight and menarcheal age are held constant. Even if it is difficult to find a simple biological relationship among these parameters, for researchers looking for relationships and structures among biological parameters, this partial correlation may be useful. A contra-pair of biological parameters, age and weight, at two growth epochs of weight is introduced, and its properties are discussed in detail.",

The experiment presented in this paper was focused on young adults. When decision involvement was low, a care appeal, compared with a gender-neutral physical activity appeal, decreased eco-friendly intentions among males. Perceived self-congruence mediated the effect. This research recommends green appeals that are perceived as gender neutral.",

      "abstract": "The human growth pattern with different developmental stages is a result of evolutionary trade‐offs showing specific features. The prolonged childhood and adolescence with their typical growth spurts is associated with age‐ and sex‐specific development of maturation signs, and changes of body proportions and dimensions. Biological age can be estimated with different methods and helps to classify human growth‐specific biological age stages. These stages include typical body markers, but also sociocultural and cognitive signs. Age‐specific growth velocity patterns and changes in proportions and dimensions are genetically fixed. Humans exhibit phenotypic plasticity that can result in secular trends. Conventionally, increases of body height and earlier maturation are explained by better nutrition and living conditions. However, strategic growth adjustments are being considered as possible explanations for the secular increase in height. In addition, reductions in some skeletal proportions in contemporary populations are assumed to be the result of reduced physical activity.",

Reporting a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) identity was associated with lower eudaimonic well-being scores. Results also indicated that perceived daily discrimination, being female, and having less education were associated with lower eudaimonic well being; racial/ethnic minority status was associated with increased eudaimonic well being.

      "abstract": "Addictive disorders are characterized by a decrease in functionality, leading to significant disruptions in daily life, due to the excessive use of certain substances or behaviors that initially induce pleasure, but ultimately result in a loss of control. There are sex/gender differences in the pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, and treatment of addictive disorders, since these disorders are caused by an interplay of biological and socio-environmental factors. It is crucial to take these differences into account in both research and clinical practice. From a neurobiological perspective, women may exhibit a faster progression toward addictive disorders, due to their reward circuit's heightened sensitivity when exposed to addictive substances. Additionally, they may be more prone to relapse because of their increased sensitivity to stress and withdrawal symptoms. The prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders is higher in men, but in Korea that belongs to Asia, alcohol use disorder is now more common among women in their 30s than among men of the same age group, reflecting an increase in prevalence among women over the last 10 years. Gaming disorders are more prevalent among men, while social media overuse is higher among women, who have a stronger emotional and interpersonal orientation than men. In treating addictive disorders, it is necessary to implement specialized programs for women. However, these programs should not perpetuate bias, while given the rising number of women with addictive disorders, we need strategies to improve their access to these programs.",

Such interaction may be complex. Two genotypes which produce the same adult height under optimal environmental circumstances may produce different heights under circumstances of privation. Thus two children who would be the same height in a well-off community may not only both be smaller under poor economic conditions, but one may be significantly smaller than the other. This type of interaction, called non-additivity of genotype and environment, may be quite detailed and specific in its effects. If a particular environmental stimulus is lacking at a time when it is essential for the child (times known as ‘sensitive periods’), then the child's development may be shunted, as it were, from one line to another. We know, as yet, little of the details of such interactions, but quite enough to make oversimplified models scientifically suspect.",

Shortly after she realized that her education and her job did not solve her personal-emotional problems, her ego structure collapsed, and she experienced a psychotic episode. This woman felt throughout her life that she was handicapped severely by her family background. She aspired to a higher status than the one ascribed to her by her family of orientation, and she struggled to achieve a desired social position through education. In the end, she was trapped by her failure to utilize her educational achievement to solve her emotional needs in the social sphere. Class V. The class V patients, both psychoneurotics and schizophrenics, were either semi-skilled or unskilled workers. They felt their jobs were unsatisfactory; they worried about how long they would last, the nature of the work, that they did not pay enough to meet the needs of their families, that there was no advancement, that the job carried no status, and so on through a long series of specific irritations. The jobs they aspired to were relatively modest ones, such as stationary engineer, machinist, a foremanship, clerical work. Significantly, not a single class V patient realized his occupational aspirations. As a group, they were aware of the connection between good jobs, steady jobs, jobs that paid a living wage, and a dreamed-of standard of living. Occupational aspirations were stronger among the class V women, both patients and spouses of patients, than among the men. Apparently, they visualized the connection between education, jobs, and mobility than the men. About one-half of the men hoped for a steady, semi-skilled factory job; the remainder dreamed of skilled jobs. Their wives, however, wanted more money, shorter hours, higher status jobs for their husbands, and a better shake for the kids.",

In both cases, there can be a lag of many years, even decades, before early adverse experiences are expressed in the form of disease.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe psychological effects of contemplating one’s death have received much empirical attention, but the impact of thinking about one’s conception—the other temporal endpoint of physical existence—has not. Across three experiments, reflecting on conception or death (vs. a neutral topic) led to increased framing of sexual reproduction as miraculous and sacred, intensified belief in discarnate immortality, and a greater desire to experience a discarnate state that offered no direct assurance of literal immortality. Thinking about death uniquely evoked greater anxiety as well as greater desire for an experience that offered assurance of literal immortality, congruent with the tenets of terror management theory. Nevertheless, the parallel effects evoked by reflecting on conception and death also suggest that both amplify the aversive salience of the limitations inherent to physical existence, such that people respond by seeking experiences and adjusting attitudes/beliefs to divert attention from the physical body.

      "abstract": "Public health concern regarding depression has recently increased as a result of the rise in the rate of adolescent suicide, with a probable concomitant rise in the rate of depression in this age group. The rise appears to be both a period effect, in that increased rates are now observed across age categories, and a cohort effect, in that being born after 1960 also contributes to the increase. The clinical phenomena and epidemiology of depression in adolescence are reviewed. Diagnostic criteria for depressive mood and depressive syndrome are similar to those in adults. However, the predictive value of a depressive episode in adolescence, and whether the occurrence of depression in adolescence is a transient developmental experience or whether it predicts a particular subtype of future depression, are at present unknown. The familial, social and personal risk factors for adolescent depression are reviewed, The major factors are: parental history of affective illness, childhood experience of parental loss, and female gender. Other factors, such as birth order and sibling factors, socio-economic status, race, religion, geography, concomitant medical illness, intelligence, career aspirations, substance abuse and life events, are reviewed, although their relative contributions as risk factors are less clear-cut. It is proposed that cross-sectional, retrospective and longitudinal studies are required to clarify important areas of uncertainty.",

KNAUZ, B.S.ed., NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY M.S., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Morton G. Harmatz The current literature shows that there is a relationship among body weight, self-esteem, and romantic relationships in men. Overweight and underweight men tend to view themselves negatively, and they tend to be viewed by others as undesirable. Underweight men have lower selfesteem scores, and they perceive the quality of their social networks to be poorer when compared to overweight men. However, no studies have been conducted on a man's perception of body weight and its effect on self-concept and romantic relationships. Using a semantic differential and a questionnaire created for this study to measure self-concept and romantic relationships, it was found that men who misperceive themselves as normal weight characterized themselves and their partners as similar to their peers. Misperceiving oneself as overweight had no negative effects, and contrary to expectations, these subjects tended to see themselves and their partners in a more favorable manner.",

      "title": "Brain Effects of Environmental Enrichment and Deprivation",
      "abstract": "The role of experience in brain organization and function can be studied by systematically manipulating developmental experiences. The most common protocols use extremes in experiential manipulation, such as environmental deprivation and/or enrichment. Studies of the effects of deprivation range from laboratory studies in which animals are raised in the absence of sensory or social experiences from infancy to children raised in orphanages with limited caregiver interaction. In both cases there are chronic perceptual, cognitive, and social dsyfunctions that are associated with chronic changes in neuronal structure and connectivity. Deprivation can be more subtle too, such as being raised in a low socioeconomic environment, which is often associated with poverty. Such experience is especially detrimental to language development, which in turn, limits educational opportunities. Unfortunately, the effects of some forms of socioemotional deprivation are often difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate. In contrast, adding sensory or social experiences can enhance behavioral functions. For example, placing animals in environments that are cognitively, motorically, and/or socially more complex than standard laboratory housing is associated with neuronal changes that are correlated with superior functions. Enhanced sensory experiences can be relatively subtle, however. For example, tactile stimulation with a soft brush for 15 minutes, three times daily for just two weeks in infant rats leads to permanent improvement in a wide range of psychological functions, including motoric, mnemonic, and other cognitive functions. Both complex environments and sensory stimulation can also reverse the negative effects of many other experiences. Thus, tactile stimulation accelerates discharge from hospital for premature human infants and stimulates recovery from stroke in both infant and adult rats. In sum, brain and behavioral functions are exquisitely influenced by manipulation of sensory experiences, especially in development.",

Adolescents are notorious for impulsivity, emotional volatility, and risky behaviors such as drinking under the influence of alcohol. By contrast, we found that risk-taking declines linearly from childhood to adulthood when individuals make choices over monetary gambles. Further, with age we found increases in the sensitivity to economic risk, defined as the degree to which a preference for assured monetary gains over a risky payoff depends upon the variability in the risky payoff. These findings indicate that decisions about economic risk may follow a different developmental trajectory than other kinds of risk taking, and that changes in sensitivity to risk may be a major factor in the development of mature risk aversion.",

Whether and how much one suffers can vary in accordance with any meaning attached to the associated pain or distress, or with expectations regarding the future. Because suffering can be affected by thoughts of meaning or of the future, some have focused on this dimension of suffering and asserted that only humans can suffer. But there is a very strong empirical case that many nonhuman animals suffer. The fact of suffering provokes moral concern, especially when suffering is caused unnecessarily, and raises ethical questions, mainly regarding the nature and extent of our obligations to those who suffer. Suffering is also an important source of personal or religious meaning in many people’s lives.",

Current evidence indicates that within populations with similar climatic adaptation, truncation or extension of the same trajectory of ontogenetic allometry accounts for the secular trend and the within-cohort stature variation, as well as the scaling of limb proportion to stature and intralimb proportions. Since secular increase is small compared to interindividual variation, the Trotter and Gleser formulae are still appropriate as long as the 95% confidence intervals are applied. A secular trend for increasing childhood and adolescent obesity is associated with a trend for accelerated skeletal maturation, but does not predict a consistent direction or a quantitative correction for traditional standards. Secular trends for increased stature and earlier maturation are overshadowed by increasing nonsecular intrapopulational variation.",

However, grip strength does not appear to appreciably change following traditional resistance training. Thus, grip strength could be considered reflective of strength independent of resistance exercise. If true, grip strength is not necessarily informing us of the importance of resistance exercise as an adult, but potentially highlighting inherent differences between individuals who are stronger at \"baseline\" compared to their weaker counterpart. The purpose of this article is to discuss: (1) potential factors that may influence grip strength and (2) hypothesize strategies that may be able to influence grip strength and ultimately attain a higher baseline level of strength. Although there appears to be a limited ability to augment grip strength as an adult, there may be critical periods during growth/development during which individuals can establish a higher baseline. Establishing a high baseline of strength earlier in life may have long-term implications related to mortality and disease.",

Sin embargo, no existe un fuerte consenso sobre los indicadores que determinan el poseer una buena o una mala salud sexual, y más cuando hablamos de una población de especial vulnerabilidad dados los múltiples cambios físicos, psicológicos y sociales a los que se enfrentan en poco tiempo. En el presente estudio exponemos el proceso de construcción de una batería de instrumentos para la evaluación de la salud sexual de los niños, niñas y adolescentes. Tras la realización de un completo proceso de valoración, guiado por múltiples expertos en el área, se ha concluido que tanto los conocimientos como las actitudes (p.ej. sexismo) y habilidades sexuales (p.ej. asertividad sexual) son un indicador principal. Asimismo, los comportamientos sexuales de riesgo (p. ej. búsqueda de sensaciones sexuales, adicción al sexo, al cibersexo o conductas de sexting), también se consideran variables importantes. Disponer de una batería de instrumentos validados en este grupo poblacional que recoja todos los aspectos relevantes para la valoración de su salud sexual va a permitir, no solo conocer más sobre la misma, sino también probar si la educación afectivo-sexual que reciben es adecuada y suficiente para asegurar un desarrollo sexual saludable.",

The health of a population and its achievement in the workplace are enhanced when individuals have some freedom and some responsibility, but not too much of either, and when civil associations of individuals rather than individuals acting alone are the essential social units. The consistent association of social contacts with health and productivity provides strong support for the premise that intimate relationships are the focus around which people's lives revolve. Membership of a \"social network\" may be merely conforming to a reigning social norm, and this could mean having to pay an important price in the loss of creativity associated with individualism. But social conformity should not prevent individuals from going their own way, and it should be possible to combine the luxury of individuality with an active life in civic affairs. Less than complete freedom may fall short of existential utopia, but it may be best for our health and wellbeing.",

Positive trends are reflected by an increase in absolute size and acceleration in the rate of growth such that children appear to be larger and mature earlier, while a negative trend results in a decrease in absolute size and deceleration in the rate of growth such that children appear to mature later and be smaller. Such changes are described as “secular trends” under the assumption that they are short‐term reversible changes occurring between generations rather than permanent alterations to the genetic potential for human growth and development. The causes of positive secular trends are thought to lie within improved health and nutrition, although some discussion has centered on whether heterosis or hybrid vigour may be a contributing factor. It seems highly likely that secular changes follow a fluctuating pattern, with both positive and negative trends occurring over the last two millennia.",

Puberty, like most biological changes, must be considered along with other changes in the developing individual and the several contexts in which that development takes place; this concept has been termed embeddedness. In addition to chronological age, grade in school, biological maturational status, and cognitive developmental status are also important influences that would fall within the category of normative age-graded influences. Biological maturational status is also distinct from chronological age. Indeed, biological maturation has several components; it would be possible to consider biological maturation in terms of highly specific aspects such as bone growth and neurological development.",

      "abstract": "Evolutionary perspectives on obesity have aimed to understand how the genetic constitution of individuals has been shaped by selective pressures such as famine, predation or infectious disease. The dual intervention model assumes strong selection on lower and upper limits of adiposity, but negligible fitness implications for intermediate adiposity. These frameworks are agnostic to age, sex and condition. I argue that selection has favoured a 'crafty genotype'-a genetic basis for accommodating variability in the 'fitness value' of fat through phenotypic plasticity, depending on the endogenous and exogenous characteristics of each individual. Hominin evolution occurred in volatile environments. I argue that the polygenetic basis of adiposity stabilizes phenotype in such environments, while also coordinating phenotypic variance across traits. This stability underpins reaction norms through which adiposity can respond sensitively to ecological factors. I consider how the fitness value of fat changes with age, sex and developmental experience. Fat is also differentially distributed between peripheral and abdominal depots, reflecting variable prioritization of survival versus reproduction. Where longevity has been compromised by undernutrition, abdominal fat may promote immediate survival and fitness, while long-term cardiometabolic risks may never materialize. This approach helps understand the sensitivity of adiposity to diverse environmental factors, and why the health impacts of obesity are variable. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Causes of obesity: theories, conjectures and evidence (Part I)'.",

      "title": "Justice matters: scaling up the response to sexual violence in areas of conflict and unrest",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence occurs in every part of the globe, and it is an ancient problem with modern relevance. For centuries to millennia, sexual violence has been used as a means to subjugate, control, or demean women and other vulnerable populations. Sexual violence can have substantial physical and mental health effects on survivors. Health consequences of sexual violence vary from mild to severe medical, gynecological, obstetric, surgical, psychological, and psychiatric trauma. The most common sequelae of sexual violence are mental health consequences, and the effects of violence manifest in different ways throughout the life span. Adults commonly experience depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic disorders. Mental health sequelae of violence manifest somewhat differently in children, though they are also susceptible to mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorders. Young children who have survived sexual violence commonly display abnormal behaviors such as eating disturbances, developmental regression, language delays, or attachment disorders. Over time, sexual violence in conflict zones has received the needed attention it deserves.",

      "abstract": "Implicit in what has come to be called the loss of control concept is the notion that the environment, or the context within which drinking occurs, exerts little influence on the quantity of alcohol consumed by an alcoholic. In contrast, recent formulations of the alcohol dependence syndrome have argued that dependence arises from an interaction among personality, pharmacological and contextual variables. The present study investigated the relationship between contextual factors and alcohol consumption in 231 men and 90 women alcoholics. Self-report questionnaire data were obtained describing social pressures to drink more or less than usual, and the usual quantity of drinking in a variety of situations (e.g., at home alone, in bars or in family settings). The findings indicate clear differences in the quantities that alcoholics drink when alone, with friends or with family. Even the dependent drinker is apparently able to discriminate the relative quantity of drinking that will be socially sanctioned in a given situation and modify consumption accordingly. In situations in which constraints are absent or minimal (e.g., alone), drinking tends to be greater than in situations in which social controls are more pronounced (e.g., with friends and family).",

      "abstract": "Nowadays young people during the phase of their puberty and adolescence often show symptoms of a grave crisis of identity which particularly idspose them to drug-abuse. On the one hand this search for one's identity is characteristic of the formative years of a juvenile; on the other hand it is a general problem of the generations which must be seen in the full context of the social, technological, industrial and political development of our time. Lacking possibilities of identification in the context of a general relativism of traditional norms and values, radical changes in the structures of the family and of our society, accompained by over-exaggerated demands on one's personal performance and prosperity, and significant failures of communication as well as the unreflected liberalization of a \"permissive society\" make young people look for new possibilities of identification which they try to find in sub-cultural groups and fascinating experiences which drugs. Many juvenile drugconsumers show increasing crises in their personalites and farreaching psychological distrubances often followed by a serious development. All these phenomena illustrate the frustrated search for genuine personal identity in an illusionary world of drugs. Only the solidaric and constructive cooperation of the generations can overcome the manifold problems and conflicts of young people which are concentrated in their identitycrises, and only this cooperation can open up new perspectives for a future which is humane and worth living, a future which is the real aim of the subcultural movements and psychodelic experiences.",

Theoriebildung wie empirische Forschung zu abweichendem Verhalten im höheren Alter sind vergleichsweise wenig entwickelt. Vorliegende Konzepte und Befunde weisen auf die Heterogenität des Phänomenbereichs \"Alterskriminalität\" und daraus resultierende Differenzierungsbedarfe hin. Kriminalität im Alter kann sich u. a. als – oftmals durch geringe Schwere gekennzeichnete – Alltagsdelinquenz darstellen, aber auch als \"Weiße Kragen-Kriminalität\" (White-Collar Crime) Älterer oder als delinquentes und gewaltförmiges Verhalten vor dem Hintergrund alterskorrelierter gesundheitlicher und kognitiver Einschränkungen. Werden diese Differenzierungen in Erklärungen für Delinquenz im Alter aufgegriffen, ergeben sich bereichsspezifische Modelle, die u. a.

      "title": "Young football player’s selection: There is a biological bias?",
      "abstract": "There is a strong link between maturational development and growth and performance. \nOrganizing age-groups using the criteria of chronological age leads to a big difference in size, composition \nand performance, and adolescence is the period when these differences are more visible and the ages \nbetween 13 and 15 years old seems to be the most heterogeneous period. In the same age group, the \nsubjects maturationally more advanced are in general heavier and taller than their peers of the same \nchronological age since childhood until the end of adolescence. However, adults don’t usually show the \nsame differences when the same comparison is made. This situation can be explained by the catch-up \nphenomenon in the late maturers individuals. \nThe initial process to identify promising athletes is multidimensional and the literature in the area show \nthat growth and maturation are two important concepts to better understand the identification, selection, \nand development processes of young athletes. Usually young players tend to be above the mean for height \nand mass and tend to be advanced in biological maturity status with increasing age during adolescence \nand in elite development programs. Worst results is been reported for body size and functional \nperformance in young soccer players who were not selected to play in more demanding competitions or \nwho dropped out from sport. The same trend was visible in academy players to whom were not proposed \na professional contract. Despite of the lack of evidence that the anthropometrical, maturational and \nphysical characteristics in the beginning of the process are not direct associated with the exceptional \nperformance in the adulthood it is of interest to understand that these indicators may open the doors of \nacademies and others training canters of excellence promoting better conditions and better coaching to \nthe selected players. Recently were not found decennial differences in the entrance profile of soccer \nplayers in a club academy. This finding suggests that the sport (soccer) promoting strategies are being \nmaintained despite of the increased demanding in the anthropometric characteristics of professional \nplayers and demands of the actual professional soccer competitions.",

This cross-sectional study (1) measured young adults' extent of knowledge and attitudes toward later-life sexuality, general sexual attitudes, and sex as leisure views and (2) tested whether knowledge about elderly sexuality, gender, sexual attitudes, and sex as leisure views explain/predict attitudes toward later-life sexuality. Data were collected using survey methodology (N = 270; 55.2% women) and analyzed with descriptive statistics and multiple regression. Young adults reported medium knowledge levels and relatively tolerant/permissive attitudes toward later-life sexuality. They also tended to have permissive general sexual attitudes and to view sex as leisure. In turn, young adults' general sexual attitudes and viewing sex as leisure predicted their acceptance of later-live sexuality, while gender and knowledge levels did not. These findings address meaningful knowledge gaps and contribute to sexual health education combating ageism.",

      "abstract": "Gerotranscendence is a new theory of human development that extends to old age. This developmental process is characterized by a shift in metaperspective from a realistic view of the world to a more transcendent or cosmic perspective. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between age, gender, spirituality, and religiosity on gerotranscendence. Qualitative surveys were distributed to 174 residents of an independent living unit in the Midwest. The survey was used to measure respondents’ age, gender, spirituality, religiosity, and gerotranscendence. The finding did not support the hypothesis that age correlated with level of gerotranscendence. Demographic characteristics of the sample could have skewed the statistics. The relationship between gender and gerotranscendence could not be analyzed due to the lack of responses from males. Both spirituality and religiosity had a significant, positive correlate to gerotranscendence, with spirituality showing a slightly stronger correlation. These results indicate that although both variables are important contributing factors to one’s sense of gerotranscendence, spirituality seems to be the broader concept that incorporates characteristics of religiosity. Implications for developing spirituality and religiosity in the elderly such as staff education, spiritual/religious diversity training, and including spirituality and religiosity as part of a holistic treatment plan, are discussed.

      "abstract": "Despite the benefits of automated vehicles (AVs), there are still barriers to their widespread adoption. Expectations about AVs have been identified as one of the most important factors in understanding AV adoption. Therefore, by understanding the public's expectations of AVs, we can better understand whether or when AVs are likely to be adopted on a wide scale. Individual differences, including demographics and personality, have been identified as factors that impact technology expectations and adoption. However, it is not clear whether and how individual differences can influence expectations of AVs. To examine this, we conducted an online survey with 443 U.S. drivers who were recruited and divided into subpopulations by age, gender, ethnicity, census region, educational level, marital status, income, driving frequency, driving experience, and personality traits. Results revealed that drivers' expectations of AVs differ significantly by age, gender, ethnicity, education levels, marital status, drive frequency, drive experience, and personality. More specifically, higher expectations are more often generated by drivers who are younger, men, White non-Hispanic, more highly educated, never married, with a higher frequency of driving, with less driving experience, and who are high in extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. The results of this study provide a foundation for future research related to expectations and have important implications on future design and development of AVs.",

Promoted and perpetuated by sport evangelists and kindred spirits, this belief inspires the strategy of using sports to create among young people the attributes needed to achieve personal success. This neoliberal approach to development is perpetuated by anecdotes and unsystematic observations that uncritically support the evangelistic promise that sport participation produces positive development among young people. Although a few scholars in the sociology of sport have studied sport participation and identified conditions under which particular outcomes are likely to occur, there remains a need for critical research and theory that identifies the processes through which sport participation is or is not linked with subsequent forms of civic engagement and efforts to produce progressive change transcending the lives of particular individuals.

      "title": "The evolution and genetics of maturation in Daphnia",
      "abstract": "Maturation is a crucial stage in the life of every organism, and theoretical and empirical studies have provided good evidence that evolution maximizes fitness at both age and size at maturity. Although the ultimate (evolutionary) determinants of maturation are well established, the proximate processes which initiate maturation are described for very few species. In the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna it has been suggested that a \"threshold size\" must be reached before maturation is initiated. This type of maturation mechanism has important implications for the evolution of age and size at maturity. The threshold size means that smaller juveniles have to grow through more instars than larger juveniles to reach maturity. Similarly, newborn of equal size, but raised under different growth conditions, reach the threshold at different times, depending on the growth rate. I suggest that the threshold mechanism serves to canalize size at maturity, and that this has consequences in form of higher variances for instar number and age at maturity. As the maturation phenotype is decoupled from variation in size at birth and variation in juvenile growth, variation in size at birth can evolve and be maintained independently from the evolution of size at maturity.",

      "title": "Not apologising for a community: young people’s responses to misrecognition and stigma",
      "abstract": "This article considers the experiences of four groups of young people (from Germany, Estonia, Russia and the UK) whose ‘mode of being’ is reduced or distorted in different ways as a result of misrecognition or stigmatisation. It argues that the responses young people make to this form of social subordination are enabled or constrained by the recognition status – misrecognition, absence of recognition or stigmatisation – they experience. It demonstrates that the experience of misrecognition and stigmatisation, in some cases, may constitute a resource to act and stimulate social change but that the institutional response to it may also work to re-embed the stigma or misrecognition that young people’s action sought to counter. It argues that stigmatisation and misrecognition are more than the accumulation of negative representations of individuals or groups. They reflect the configuration of power relations that underpin the institutionalisation of the labelling of specific groups as unworthy of respect and deny them the opportunity to participate equally in social life. The outcome of the struggle for recognition is thus not a matter of young people ‘choosing’ a positive identity or showing the desire to engage but the willingness of society to open itself to that engagement.",

      "abstract": "Adequate sleep is crucial for healthy development, contributing significantly to physical and mental well-being. While research on paediatric sleep is expanding, there remain several open questions. This narrative review provides an overview of our current knowledge on paediatric sleep health and identifies literature gaps, considering factors such as age, gender, cultural differences, and the interplay between sleep, physical activity, nutrition, and mental health. It also considers sleep health in the more specific group of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. By viewing paediatric sleep health as a multidimensional construct, this review discusses age-specific issues, including the different factors affecting satisfaction, daytime alertness, sleep timing, efficiency and duration, and sleep-related behaviours. While gender differences in sleep health become apparent after puberty, few studies have addressed sex differences in children or different parental attitudes toward sleep in boys and girls. Cultural differences in sleep duration, timing, and setting are reported from infancy through adolescence; however, the cultural influence on sleep health, particularly during adolescence, remains unclear. This is crucial when considering the effects of screen time, smartphone use, and social media exposure on sleep. Further research is required to understand how sleep, nutrition, and physical health interact throughout the developmental span. Additionally, this review underscores the protective nature of sleep for adolescent mental health and for the management of emotional and behavioural problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The review identifies critical areas for future research to enhance our understanding of paediatric sleep health and develop more effective and tailored interventions and preventive programmes.",

      "title": "Childhood Bone Mass Acquisition and Peak Bone Mass May Not Be Important Determinants of Bone Mass in Late Adulthood",
      "abstract": "During childhood and adolescence, bone mass acquisition occurs primarily through skeletal growth. It is widely assumed that bone mass acquisition throughout childhood is an important determinant of the risk of osteoporosis in late adulthood; bone mass is thought to resemble a bank account in which deposits persist indefinitely. However, several well-controlled clinical studies suggest that increasing bone mass acquisition during childhood will have only transient effects. A likely explanation is that bone mass is governed by a homeostatic system that tends to return to a set point after any perturbation and, therefore, bone mass depends primarily on recent conditions, not those in the distant past. Indeed, in an animal model, we have shown evidence that bone mass acquisition in early life has no effect on bone mass in adulthood, in part because many areas of the juvenile skeleton are replaced in toto through skeletal growth. Therefore, it should not be assumed that alterations in childhood bone mass acquisition will affect bone mass many decades later in late adulthood. This issue remains open and the solution may depend on the type of childhood condition (for example calcium intake versus exercise) and its magnitude, timing, and duration. To date, both animal studies and clinical studies suggest that much of the effect of early bone mass acquisition does not persist.",

Studi-studi awal tentang makanan lebih banyak menyorot masalah kebiasaan makan sebagai suatu bentuk tingkah laku berpola yang sangat terkait dengan kebudayaan, yang mencakup juga kepercayaan dan pantangan makan yang berkembang dalam sekelompok masyarakat, dan juga berkaitan dengan faktor lingkungan sebagai sumber perolehan bahan pangan yang utama. Kajian lain menekankan pada pengaruh atau dampak makanan sebagai klasifikasi budaya tersebut terhadap kesehatan atau gizi masyarakat pendu kungnya. Jerome, Kandel &amp;amp; Pelto (1980) menyebut istilah ini dengan klasifikasi non- makanan yang juga berkontribusi terhadap kasus kurang gizi.

Some are even repulsed by that person’s physical appearance. Such responses, evident within the Christian community as well, fail to acknowledge the inherent worth of the person as created in God’s image. Obviously harmful to the disabled, such attitudes also trap able-bodied persons within a normate bias, making difficult the successful inclusion of persons with disabilities in classrooms, churches, and communities. Beauty and the Beast is used to challenge these perceptions and point to the beauty of the disabled, made visible through “wholesight.” Personal acquaintance and anecdotal descriptions of persons with disabilities illustrate such beauty.",

      "abstract": "Personal-episodic or autobiographical memories are an important source of evidence for continuity of self over time. Numerous studies conducted with adults have revealed a relative paucity of personal-episodic or autobiographical memories of events from the first 3 to 4 years of life, with a seemingly gradual increase in the number of memories until approximately age 7 years, after which an adult distribution has been assumed. Historically, this so-called infantile amnesia or childhood amnesia has been attributed either to late development of personal-episodic or autobiographical memory (implying its absence in the early years of life) or to an emotional, cognitive, or linguistic event that renders early autobiographical memories inaccessible to later recollection. However, neither type of explanation alone can fully account for the shape of the distribution of autobiographical memories early in life. In contrast, the complementary processes account developed in this article acknowledges early, gradual development of the ability to form, retain, and later retrieve memories of personally relevant past events, as well as an accelerated rate of forgetting in childhood relative to adulthood. The adult distribution of memories is achieved as (a) the quality of memory traces increases, through addition of more, better elaborated, and more tightly integrated personal-episodic or autobiographical features; and (b) the vulnerability of mnemonic traces decreases, as a result of more efficient and effective neural, cognitive, and specifically mnemonic processes, thus slowing the rate of forgetting. The perspective brings order to an array of findings from the adult and developmental literatures.",

Additional factors, such as being female, having a low socioeconomic status, or being institutionalized can raise loneliness among the elderly. Loneliness can have a noteworthy influence on the well-being of the elderly, leading to depression and even death. There are several existing interventions to tackle loneliness, but their significance is minimal. This article aims to raise awareness of the epidemic called senior isolation.",

      "abstract": "The psychiatric consequences of induced abortion continue to be the object of controversy. The reactions of women when they became aware of conception are very variable. Pregnancy, whether initially intended or unintended, may provoke stress; and miscarriage may bring about feelings of loss and grief reaction. Therefore, induced abortion, with its emotional implications (of relief, shame and guilt) not surprisingly is a stressful adverse life event. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: There is agreement among researchers on the need to compare the mental health outcomes (or the psychiatric complications) with appropriate groups, including women with unintended pregnancies ending in live births and women with miscarriages. There is also agreement on the need to control for the potential confounding effects of multiple variables: demographic, contextual, personal development, previous or current traumatic experiences, and mental health prior to the obstetric event. Any psychiatric outcome is multi-factorial in origin and the impact of life events depend on how they are perceived, the psychological defence mechanisms (unconscious to a great extent) and the coping style. The fact of voluntarily aborting has an undeniable ethical dimension in which facts and values are interwoven.No research study has found that induced abortion is associated with a better mental health outcome, although the results of some studies are interpreted as <<neutral>> or <<mixed.>> Some general population studies point out significant associations with alcohol or illegal drug dependence, mood disorders (including depression) and some anxiety disorders. Some of these associations have been confirmed, and nuanced, by longitudinal prospective studies which support causal relationships.With the available data, it is advisable to devote efforts to the mental health care of women who have had an induced abortion. Reasons of the woman's mental health by no means can be invoked, on empirical bases, for inducing an abortion.",

A complex interplay of genetic, environmental, hormonal and behavioral factors determines skeletal development, and a greater effort is needed to identify the most critical factors that establish peak bone strength. Indeed, knowledge of modifiable factors that determine skeletal development may permit optimization of skeletal health during growth and could potentially offset reductions in bone strength with aging. The peripubertal years represent a unique period when the skeleton is particularly responsive to loading exercises, and there is now overwhelming evidence that exercise can optimize skeletal development. While this is not controversial, the most effective exercise prescription and how much investment in this prescription is needed to significantly impact bone health continues to be debated. Despite considerable progress, these issues are not easy to address, and important questions remain unresolved. This review focuses on the key determinants of skeletal development, whether exercise during childhood and adolescence should be advocated as a safe and effective strategy for optimizing peak bone strength, and whether investment in exercise early in life protects against the development of osteoporosis and fractures later in life.",

The gold standard for determining what constitutes due care in any particular situation is what a reasonable person, similarly situated, would do. Determinations of due care are necessarily fact specific. Nevertheless, the general objective is to strike an appropriate balance between an unrealistically high standard of caution and one that fails to take into account the known or foreseeable risks of any human endeavor. The same standard applies to individuals regardless of their age (so long as they have reached majority), gender, race, and level of education or economic status. The standard also applies to fictional “persons” such as corporations. The usual or prevailing custom and practice in an industry or occupation may provide relevant evidence of what constitutes “due care” in the activities common to it, but that evidence can be effectively overcome or rebutted by competent, credible evidence that the custom and practice either diverges from what it has been asserted to be or that the custom and practice is itself unsafe or otherwise poses an unreasonable risk of harm to others. Until quite recently, a singular exception to this general principle of tort law was made for the medical profession. We will consider this exception in the next section.",

      "abstract": "• We have studied the interaction between boyhood crossgender behavior, \"homphobia,\" and religiosity in men raised as Catholics who, during adulthood, considered themselves transsexual, homosexual, or heterosexual. The sample consisted of 43 transsexual, 78 homosexual, and 43 heterosexual subjects matched for age, race, educational level, and economic status. The transsexual men recalled the most \"feminine\" behavior during boyhood, followed by the homosexual men. The heterosexual group was most \"homophobic,\" followed by the transsexuals. \"Homophobia\" positively correlated with religiosity among adult transsexuals and heterosexuals. Transsexuals, recalling childhood, perceived their parents as being more religious than did the homosexuals. At intermediate levels of \"femininity,\" greater \"homophobia\" scores were associated with more transsexual characteristics. These data support the thesis that early developmental aspects of sexual identity, and later concerns over homosexuality that are partly of a religious derivative, may contribute to a transsexual outcome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Older participants who are briefly presented with the ‘my wife/mother-in-law’ ambiguous figure estimate its age to be higher than young participants do. This finding is thought to be the result of a subconscious social group bias that influences participants’ perception of the figure. Because people are better able to recognize similarly aged individuals, young participants are expected to perceive the ambiguous figure as a young woman, while older participants are more likely to recognize an older lady. We replicate the difference in age estimates, but find no relationship between participants’ age and their perception of the ambiguous figure. This leads us to conclude that the positive relationship between participants’ age and their age estimates of the ambiguous ‘my wife/mother-in-law’ figure is better explained by the own-age anchor effect, which holds that people use their own age as a yard stick to judge the age of the figure, regardless of whether the young woman or the older lady is perceived. Our results disqualify the original finding as an example of cognitive penetrability: the participants’ age biases their judgment of the ambiguous figure, not its perception.",

Subjective measures of poverty therefore are influenced not only by individuals' material situation, but also by other variables that determine individuals' feelings of deprivation, such as relative concerns, worries about uncertainty, and vulnerability. Subjective poverty measurement has gained importance in recent years not only to measure poverty lines and estimate the incidence of poverty in a region, but also to understand what the determinants of the individuals' feelings of poverty are and which individual characteristics other than income and family size are key determinants of feelings of poverty. Subjective poverty analysis can be extended to other dimensions, such as wellbeing or health poverty.",

      "abstract": "The classic evolutionary theory of aging explains why mortality rises with age: as individuals grow older, less lifetime fertility remains, so continued survival contributes less to reproductive fitness. However, successful reproduction often involves intergenerational transfers as well as fertility. In the formal theory offered here, age-specific selective pressure on mortality depends on a weighted average of remaining fertility (the classic effect) and remaining intergenerational transfers to be made to others. For species at the optimal quantity-investment tradeoff for offspring, only the transfer effect shapes mortality, explaining postreproductive survival and why juvenile mortality declines with age. It also explains the evolution of lower fertility, longer life, and increased investments in offspring.",

La mayor habilidad cognitiva y el ser indígena en México es sinónimo de infelicidad, pero el ser blanco y tener una mejor memoria es mejor para el Ingles. La salud física es mejor en ambos países considerando ingreso, educación, empleo, y salud mental. Un resultado importante es que la depresión y la falta de descanso adecuado afectan negativamente la salud física en general. Los ingleses ven deteriorada su salud por el efecto de las deudas contraídas, pero no los mexicanos. Los adultos mayores en México ven severamente disminuida su salud cuando viven en unión libre, pero para los ingleses, este tipo de arreglo social implica tener una mejor salud incluso que si estuvieran casados. La salud mental, aproximada con la habilidad cognitiva, fue la relación con menos significancia estadística. Las personas divorciadas en México tienen una mejor habilidad para recordar cosas.

      "abstract": "This paper describes severe, disorders of maternal affection and behaviour and suggests that there is an early process of mother-to-infant bonding which can go seriously wrong.Forty-four self-selected women who had suffered from at least one episode of postnatal mental illness described an unexpected and often catastrophic failure to love one or more of their babies.These women reported absent affection, sometimes hate, rejection, neglect or impulses to harm, in relation to at least one of their children. These feelings often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, and with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the term 'maternal bonding disorder'. Twenty-nine of the women were multiparae; first-borns were not significantly more likely to be the focus for such feelings. There was no direct evidence of predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences. Postnatal mental illness and recalled severe pain during labour were significantly associated with such disorders which, in their severe forms, did not occur in the absence of postnatal mental illness.The nature of the link between postnatal mental illness and disorders of maternal bonding remains unclear. Because, in multiparae, the disorder often 'missed' the first child, factors such as maternal personality traits or early childhood experiences cannot be regarded as sufficient causes.",

      "abstract": "My thesis seeks to reduce what may be a natural human antipathy to ageing and/or the elderly by working with one distinctive and consistently approved feature of some older people. This feature is a bold and cheerful struggle within a self‐chosen project. The argument opens by distinguishing short‐term gratification from lasting, fulfilling happiness, and showing the link between gratification and dependence. Three kinds of struggle (non‐voluntary, part‐voluntary and positive) are then outlined and exemplified. Gerontological and anthropological research suggest that attitudes to struggle are fixed early in life, and while in the past they mitigated for or against successful survival, they now influence happiness and coping in later life. I argue that the negative effects of the first two kinds of struggle ‐ which are often misguided, grudging or ‘no‐win’ struggles ‐ are responsible for the rigidity, narcissism and resentment disliked in some older people. Self‐respect, contrasted with self‐righteousness, is shown to accrue only from the positive (voluntary and congenial) struggle that seems at any age to deflect or compensate for depression, disappointment, loneliness and illness.",

      "abstract": "Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) describes divergent body sizes of adult males and females. While SSD has traditionally been explained by sexual and fecundity selection, recent advances in physiology and developmental biology emphasize that SSD would occur proximately because of sexual differences in ontogenetic growth trajectories (i.e., growth rate and duration). Notably, these ontogenetic traits are subject to energetic or time constraints and thus traded off with fitness components (e.g., survival and reproduction). To elucidate the importance of such ontogenetic trade‐offs in the evolution of SSD, we developed a new theoretical framework by extending quantitative genetic models for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in which we reinterpret the trait as body size and reformulate sex‐specific fitness in size‐dependent manners. More specifically, we assume that higher growth rate or longer growth duration leads to larger body size and higher reproductive success but incurs the cost of lower survivorship or shorter reproduction period. We illustrate how two sexes would optimize ontogenetic growth trajectories in sex‐specific ways and exhibit divergent body sizes. The present framework provides new insights into the evolutionary theory of SSD and predictions for empirical testing.",

For survivors, war's effects are often embodied, leaving long-term effects on health and biology. Some of these effects, such as injuries and psychological trauma, are well known. Yet other effects may be subtle and may be elucidated by a developmental biological perspective. In early life, when growth rates are highest, conditions of war may have their greatest impact. Depending on local circumstances, a developing embryo, infant, or child growing in a place embroiled in armed conflict is likely to face—directly or indirectly—various stressors, including malnutrition, infectious disease, and/or psychological stress. Thus, the conditions of war and forced displacement may become embodied, getting under the skin for fundamental biological reasons.",

      "abstract": "Race is an unscientific, societally constructed taxonomy that is based on an ideology that views some human population groups as inherently superior to others on the basis of external physical characteristics or geographic origin. The concept of race is socially meaningful but of limited biological significance. Racial or ethnic variations in health status result primarily from variations among races in exposure or vulnerability to behavioral, psychosocial, material, and environmental risk factors and resources. Additional data that capture the specific factors that contribute to group differences in disease must be collected. However, reductions in racial disparities in health will ultimately require change in the larger societal institutions and structures that determine exposure to pathogenic conditions. More attention needs to be given to the ways that racism, in its multiple forms, affects health status. Socio-economic status is a central determinant of health status, overlaps the concept of race, but is not equivalent to race. Inadequate attention has been given to the range of variation in social, cultural, and health characteristics within and between racial or ethnic minority populations. There is a growing emphasis, both within and without the Federal Government, on the collection of racial or ethnic identifiers in health data systems, but noncoverage of the Asian and Pacific Islander population, Native Americans, and subgroups of the Hispanic population is still a major problem. However, for all racial or ethnic groups, we need not only more data but better data. We must be more active in directly measuring the health-related aspects of belonging to these social categories.",

      "title": "Prejuicio sexual relacionado con personajes ficticios gay: Una comparación entre muestras de El Salvador y Reino Unido",
      "abstract": "Una estrategia para disminuir el prejuicio de un grupo social hacia otro es el uso de historias de ficción. Esta modalidad de contacto indirecto destaca como alternativa cuando el contacto directo no es viable, ya sea por falta de oportunidad para un encuentro o porque conlleva riesgos para las partes involucradas. El objetivo de este estudio fue comparar niveles de prejuicio sexual en participantes heterosexuales que vieron o leyeron una historia con personajes gay y quienes imaginaron un encuentro con una persona gay o una desconocida. A través de un diseño experimental, se puso a prueba la hipótesis de que el prejuicio sexual (prejuicio alto o prejuicio bajo) variaría en función de la historia (ficticia o imaginada) y del país de origen de los participantes (El Salvador o Reino Unido). En comparación con participantes del Reino Unido, participantes de El Salvador puntuaron significativamente más bajo en Dominancia social, más alto en Autoritarismo e Identificación heterosexual, y reportaron menoracuerdo con las uniones legales de parejas del mismo sexo. No se encontró asociación entre estos factores y puntajes de prejuicio sexual. Se discuten posibles explicaciones a estos resultados y direcciones futuras para el uso de narrativas en la reducción del prejuicio hacia minorías sexuales.",

      "title": "The social stigma attached to obesity: risk factors and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "The medical effects of obesity are well-documented and well-publicized. But, just as obesity may be associated with a variety of health issues, it can also bring a less well-understood effect: stigma and discrimination. The social consequences of being overweight and obese are serious, pervasive and throughout our culture, and is evident at different levels across lines of gender, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Overweight and obese individuals are often targets of bias and stigma, and are vulnerable to negative attitudes in multiple domains of living including places of employment, educational institutions, medical facilities, the mass media, and interpersonal relationships. Along with implications to physical health, obesity often carries a stigma that negatively impacts the social, emotional, and psychological functioning of those who are overweight or perceive themselves as overweight. This paper seeks to review on causal attribution of obesity and its social consequences. Interpersonal sources, multiple domains and coping strategies are also captured. In light of the immense burden of obesity on health care systems and also on the individuals' quality of life, it is recommended that stigma-reduction interventions should focus on educating students at all levels of educational system and the general public about size acceptance and further challenge negative attitudes. Also, prevention programs with information campaigns might have a high potential in increasing awareness about stigmatization.",

In the elderly there is a progressive decline of organic functions; the decrease of sexual and procreating activity is linked with the impaired male hormonal production. The four stages of sexual function are modified: 1. delayed erection; 2. plateau prolongation; 3. orgasm modifications; 4. fast penis detumescence. In addition to organic impairment, aesthetic, social, environmental and psychological factors can restrict sexual activity, as well as past sexual experiences and co-morbidity. There are specific aspects concerning sexuality in the elderly, such as the increased chances of public relations and emotional involvement, the more intense psychic activity and the stronger process of removal and sublimation of impulses. In conclusion the best way to deal with sexuality in the elderly is the multidimensional assessment.",

Confrontées à une situation de disponibilité et de pléthore jamais connue, de nombreuses jeunes femmes se soumettent à une alimentation contrôlée et restreinte. Ce comportement conduit à des troubles alimentaires, anorexies et boulimies notamment, avec leur cortège de désordres physiques et mentaux sévères. Primitive ou secondaire, la peur de grossir se trouve au cœur de la plupart des troubles alimentaires. Cette peur entretient et aggrave ces troubles. Il faut donc intervenir pour rompre le cercle vicieux : restriction-anorexie-boulimie, désordres psychologiques. Liés à des causes multiples, ces troubles alimentaires ne peuvent être abordés sous un seul angle. Seule une approche multidisciplinaire permet de pacifier la relation à l’aliment et au corps. À travers l’analyse minutieuse de tous les facteurs en cause, Bernard Waysfeld envisage les différentes prises en charge et privilégie l’approche de la personne dans sa singularité. Car réduire le trouble alimentaire à un simple trouble des conduites ou pire à un trouble nutritionnel constitue une démarche contre-productive vouée à l’échec.",

      "title": "Careering Past the Doctorate: supporting the career progression of doctoral students",
      "abstract": "This paper will focus on women’s self-understanding and its relation to the body. While for both men and women self-awareness includes body-awareness, for women, the relationship is more fundamental and the body is a significant aspect of the self. This is well exemplified by the way in which self-control, or more accurately control of the self, is routinely applied to the body. Bodies are perceived as being subject to control through diet and exercise, and obese women are described as being out of control or lacking in self-control. \r\nClothes clearly have an influence on body image, but the relationship is more intimate than this would suggest. Because they sit next to the body, clothes have an inward aspect that is closely related to body awareness, especially when there is a discrepancy between the two, as happens when clothes do not fit, thus highlighting the body’s shortcomings. In terms of awareness, the two become intertwined, and attitudes and beliefs associated with the body/self extend to feelings about the clothes. This is apparent in attitudes to various aspects of control. Clothes are often discussed in terms of what cannot be worn because of age, size, acceptance and fashion. This attitude to control includes the perceived controlling attitudes of others, for example, what a husband might not like, or what friends or colleagues might not approve.\r\nClothing then has an important role to play in self-awareness, and fashion assumes a significance belied by its apparent superficiality. This paper will explore these issues, making reference to my own research with women, exploring their relationship with their bodies and their attitude to clothing.",

      "abstract": "Disparities are differences in health outcomes among groups that originate from sources including historically experienced social injustice and broadly defined environmental exposures. Large health disparities exist, defined by many factors including race/ethnicity, sex, age, geography, and socioeconomic status. Studying disparities relies on measures of disease burden. Traditional measures, such as mortality, may be less applicable to neurological disorders, which often lead to substantial morbidity and lower quality of life, without necessarily causing death. Measures such as disability-adjusted life-years or healthy life expectancy may be more appropriate for assessing neurological disease and permit comparisons across diseases and communities. There are many approaches that can be used to study disparities. Analyses of population-based observational studies, patient registries, and administrative data all contribute to the understanding of disparities in humans. Animal and other experimental designs, including clinical trials, may be used to identify mechanisms and strategies to reduce disparities. All of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, understanding and mitigating disparities will require use of all of these methods. Crucially, a focus on not only improving outcomes among all individuals in society but minimizing or eliminating differences between those with better outcomes and those who have historically been disadvantaged should drive the ongoing investigations into disparities. This review is focused on epidemiological approaches to examining the depth and determinants of racial-ethnic disparities in the United States related to stroke, stroke care, and stroke outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Women tend to live longer than men, and thus typically have more interactions with the healthcare system in old age than men do. Ageism and stereotypes of older people in general can have an important impact on elders’ physical and mental health and well‐being. For example, internalized negative stereotypes can produce self‐fulfilling prophecies through stereotype embodiment and contribute to weakness and dependency. Ageist beliefs and stereotypes can interfere with health care seeking as well as with diagnosis and treatment recommendations; they can, for example, contribute to gender disparities in the health care of older adults if older women are perceived as too frail to undergo aggressive treatments. Ageism also results in disrespectful treatment of older patients, which is communicated through baby talk and other forms of infantilization or the shrugging off of patients’ complaints and concerns as “just old age.” Intersectional identities can result in a cumulative burden for older women patients who may have a history of disrespectful treatment for other reasons (e.g., sexism, racism, bias against lesbians). Reduction of ageism and sexism and promotion of more realistic and diverse views of older women could improve doctor–patient relationships, facilitate adherence to treatment regimens, and reduce disparities in health and health care.",

An earlier view linking sex exclusively with reproductive function has given way to a holistic view of sex as vital to self-concept, the maintenance of healthy interpersonal relationships, and a sense of integrity. Older adults often have difficulty communicating sexual problems, concerns, and questions because of their conflicting attitudes and perceptions. Sexual problems often are presented covertly, expressed in vague terms, or masked by embarrassment. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of covert sexual dysfunctions, clear about their own attitudes and expectations to avoid stereotyping the elderly, and knowledgeable about pharmacological, organic, and psychosocial bases of sexual problems in older patients.",

'You are going senile' and 'senile old fool' are expressions of abuse, and even when the word is used in a kindly context, such as 'You should make allowances, she is senile' or 'The poor old thing is going senile', the inference is still one that suggests that the old person is ceasing to be a person.",

We study in an experiment how both birth order and siblings’ gender composition are related to risk, time, and social preferences. We find that second-born children are typically less patient, more risk-tolerant, and more trusting. However, siblings’ gender composition interacts importantly with birth order effects. Second-born children are more risk-taking only with same-gender siblings. In mixed-gender environments, children seem to identify with the gender stereotype that boys are much more willing to take risks than girls, irrespective of birth order. For trust and trustworthiness, birth order effects are larger with mixed-gender siblings. Only for patience, siblings’ gender composition does not matter.",

      "abstract": "Inter-individual variance in biomedical data can be large. This often makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions, and a large inter-individual variance has traditionally been considered an unwanted problem rather than an interesting aspect. However, variance not only arises from measuring errors but can also be due to systematic, trait-like differences among individuals, the investigation of which may reveal new insight into the function and regulation of biological processes. \r\nIn the field of sleep-wake regulation and performance, variance may conceivably arise from disparities in the underlying homeostatic and circadian processes, or it may arise from trait-like differences in the tolerance of sleep loss or circadian misalignment such as occur during shiftwork and jetlag. Among the groups that have been compared with each other are young and older individuals, men and women, short sleepers and long sleepers, morning and evening persons (“larks” and “owls”), as well as groups with specific genetic polymorphisms. For example, it was reported that with regard to sustained attention, healthy older individuals (65-76 years) tolerate sleep loss better than young ones (18-30 years), that short sleepers (sleep duration 9 h), and that a difference in the timing of optimal performance between morning and evening persons may be due to a disparity in the length of endogenous circadian period. Furthermore, polymorphisms in genes involved in circadian rhythmicity (Period-3; PER3) and in the metabolism of the neuromodulator adenosine (Adenosine-deaminase; ADA) have been reported to predict increased vulnerability to sleep deprivation as reflected in impairments in attention and other aspects of cognitive performance.\r\n\tThe systematic study of inter-individual differences and their biological basis is important because 1) it is likely to provide new insights into the function and regulation of sleep, 2) it may help identify those individuals at risk for suffering the negative consequences of sleep loss and circadian misalignment, 3) it may help us develop adequate policies and countermeasures against those consequences (“personalized medicine”).",

The data in this piece of work were obtained from members of 100 families, who were arranged in 5 grades according to nutrition (from poor appetite to hearty eater) and to activity (from very inactive to exceedingly active), the mark for activity being subtracted from that for nutrituion and the nutritional residual so obtained being correlated with the deviation of the chest girth from the normal. The correlation between these two is 0.335. Hence the authors argue that variations in build depend only to a slight degree upon nutrition.

      "abstract": "Many of the changes that accompany physical inactivity coincide with those that occur during aging. These changes are generally grouped under the term of 'disuse' (or \"lack of use\" or \"inappropriately modulated stimulation\"). Studies of long-term space travel have revealed that weightlessness in space also induces changes resembling those of aging and physical inactivity. The relationship between disuse (due to bed rest, insufficient exercise, or lack of gravity) and aging has some definite practical implications. As life expectancy is lenghtened in all populations worldwide, the number of elderly with varying degrees of disability leading to reduced physical activity also increases. Changes induced by bed rest as a consequence of disease may also be superimposed on aging changes and further diminish physiologic reserves and accelerate pathology. Therefore, the study of disuse, irrespective of its etiology, may serve as a model for understanding not only some of the functional changes induced by lack of activity and/or gravity but also some of the disabilities of old age. Indeed, a better understanding of disuse phenomena will make it possible to establish programs of prevention and rehabilitation that will ameliorate both disuse and aging deficits.",

      "title": "Food and nutrition security in poverty alleviation: Concepts, strategies, and experiences at the German Agency for Technical Cooperation*",
      "abstract": "Poverty alleviation and food and nutrition security remain one of the priority areas of development policies for the German government. Poverty exists when individuals or groups are not able to satisfy their basic needs adequately. Poverty consists of at least three dimensions: (i) the availability of essential resources for basic needs; (ii) financial and other means of poor individuals and groups; and (iii) the physical, intellectual, social, and cultural status and position of poor individuals and groups. Following this model, the severity of poverty is the collective gap between the availability of the essential resources (i) and the individual ability to meet basic needs (ii) + (iii). Basic needs are not covered if individuals or groups are not able to develop themselves physically, intellectually, and/or socially according to their genetic potentials. As a result, growth retardation of children (‘stunting’), who are biologically and socially the most vulnerable individuals of the society, is a valid cultural independent indicator for poverty. One form of poverty is food and nutrition insecurity. Food security is achieved if adequate food (quantity, quality, safety, sociocultural acceptability) is available and accessible for and satisfactorily utilized by all individuals at all times to live a healthy and happy life. Food and nutrition programmes have four dimensions: (i) categorical; (ii) socio‐organizational; (iii) managerial; and (iv) situation‐related dimensions. As shown in three examples of Indonesian−German programmes, despite the complexity of poverty and food and nutrition security, with adequate targeting of the most vulnerable population, adequate identification of problems for a proper selection of interventions and frequent evaluation, reduction of poverty and food insecurity can be achieved.",

      "title": "THROUGHOUT THE GENERATIONS: HOW AGE AND RELIGIOSITY MAY BE CHANGING OUR VIEWS ON KEY SOCIAL ISSUES",
      "abstract": "This study seeks to assess the impact of age and strength of religious affiliation on Americans’ opinions on the environment, abortion, homosexuality, and the government in general. Other factors such as income, gender, and education level were also considered because these could have an impact on one’s view of certain issues. The interaction of both age and religious affiliation is considered as well to control for individuals of various ages and religiosity levels. This study also aims to find a relationship between age and those four issues listed above as well as education level and religious affiliation. Singling out those variables allows the study to lay a foundation for its more complex hypotheses. The results indicate that while age and religious affiliation were not significant factors in one’s viewpoint as strongly as expected, both were significant when determining a participant’s view on the environment. Not surprisingly, religious affiliation was a significant factor in determining one’s opinion of homosexuality; as strength of religious affiliation increases, a participant is more likely to think homosexuality is wrong sometimes or always wrong. Education level produced significant results for determining opinions on homosexuality as well as abortion. As education level increases, a participant is more likely to think that homosexuality is ok and that a woman having an abortion for any reason is acceptable. Lastly, this study has found that while one’s age increases, he or she is slightly more likely to think homosexuality is wrong. Curiously, while it is commonly thought that young Americans hold more liberal views on many issues, it was discovered here that there is virtually no difference in the opinions of old and young Americans on abortion.",

      "abstract": "A community recruited sample of Latino gay and bisexual men in New York were asked to indicate their likelihood of adopting the insertive (activo) or receptive (pasivo) roles in oral and anal sex according to partners' characteristics. The results show that gender stereotypes of masculinity and femininity play an important role in the sexual behaviour of this population. Versatile individuals report higher likelihood of taking a pasivo sexual role when they perceive a sexual partner as being more masculine than themselves based on his appearing more macho, more aggressive, taller, endowed with a bigger penis, more handsome, or darker skinned. By contrast, respondents report more likelihood of taking an activo role when the partner is perceived as more effeminate, less aggressive, shorter, endowed with a smaller penis, less handsome, or of lighter skin colour. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that, although gender stereotypes play an important generic role, contextual and emotional circumstances may significantly affect sexual‐role behaviour in specific cases.",

Thus, it is contemplated as a general objective: to demonstrate the importance of the practice of physical exercises, as a possible benefit in the prophylaxis of falls in the elderly, and, by specific objectives: to approach as the function of the elderly and of aging; to analyze the risk factors related to falls in the elderly and to identify the benefits to the physical exercises for the prevention of falls in the elderly. In this dimension, the elderly were defined as the individual over 60 years of age, however, as an elderly population is not homogeneous, it is considered that the definition of the elderly is not limited to chronological age, but it is related to factors such as genetics, habits and attitudes of life. In turn aging is generally defined as the process of biological, physiological, morphological, biochemical and psychological modifications. There is no result of a human life stage, a person can present more fragility, and becomes more susceptible to fall events and events, being such facts, sewn by individual / particularized (intrinsic) and environmental factors (extrinsic), which can generate physical and psychological consequences for the elderly. Hence the understanding of the importance of preventing falls risk. For this, par excellence, it is necessary for regular practice of physical exercises, especially, strengthening and balance, always under the recommendation that such exercise programs are planned and adapted to the physical conditions of each individual, especially by a professional of Physical Education.",

Al analizar los efectos de la violencia sobre la salud de la mujer se obtiene que las expone a un mayor riesgo de enfermedades físicas y mentales por lo que aumenta el interés en estudiar algunos marcadores que orienten su confirmación diagnóstica. Con la investigación se pretende estudiar los resultados que abordan esta problemática desde distintos ámbitos promoviendo una mirada integral y multidisciplinaria sobre la violencia, fenómeno con múltiples implicaciones sociales y culturales que influyen a la aplicación de tales políticas y medidas de control sanitario y judicial en la República del Ecuador. es necesario no solo identificar y tener claro las formas en que se materializa la violencia entre las personas puesto que el desconocimiento teórico de la misma puede llevar a tener consecuencias graves en el desarrollo físico y psicológico del ser humano cuyo desenlace puede resultar desde una disfuncionalidad del adulto hasta la muerte, ya sea en mujeres gestantes, el feto o en el adulto deprimido. El marco legal reconoce la existencia de esta problemática, tanto así que los esfuerzos al legislar resultan en un conjunto de artículos y leyes que busca consecuencias judiciales para quien las cometa.",

      "title": "Grandpa and the Snapper: The Well-Being of the Elderly Who Live with Children",
      "abstract": "Elderly Americans who live with people under age 18 have lower life evaluations than those who do not. They also experience worse emotional outcomes, including less happiness and enjoyment, and more stress, worry, and anger. In part, these negative outcomes come from selection into living with a child, especially selection on poor health, which is associated with worse outcomes irrespective of living conditions. Yet even with controls, the elderly who live with children do worse. This is in sharp contrast to younger adults who live with children, likely their own, whose life evaluation is no different in the presence of the child once background conditions are controlled for. Parents, like elders, have enhanced negative emotions in the presence of a child, but unlike elders, also have enhanced positive emotions. In parts of the world where fertility rates are higher, the elderly do not appear to have lower life evaluations when they live with children; such living arrangements are more usual, and the selection into them is less negative. They also share with younger adults the enhanced positive and negative emotions that come with children. The misery of the elderly living with children is one of the prices of the demographic transition.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)",

Teen pregnancy has been linked to deaths and other subsequent related psychological consequences, such as trauma and depression, as well as to socioeconomic issues such as financial hurdles and social isolation. So far, risk factors such as lack of sexual knowledge and reproductive health awareness have been associated with teen pregnancy. However, seldom considered factors like individual biological circumstances, such as early psychophysiological maturing, conduct issues, parenting deficit, or family instability and family dynamic can also be leading risk factors associated with teen pregnancy. This chapter explores the potential risk factors associated with teen pregnancy in North America (Canada, United States, and Mexico) from a biopsychological aspect, multi-ethnic, sociocultural, and economic diversity context. The chapter is a compilation of literature of possible risk factors associated with teenage pregnancy in North America.",

The prevalent thinking of the time assigned (white, middle/upper class) women separate roles. Based on Christian religious beliefs rooted in Victorian era ideology, women were expected to maintain a level of domesticity and morality in order to remain feminine. Similarly, medical professionals often construed women as weak and frail, due to the energy demand of the reproductive system. These two ideologies together limited women’s participation in both physical education and competitive athletics. Focusing primarily on the role of women’s colleges, it is argued that these limitations have had long term effects on the development of women’s sport, from intercollegiate competitions to the Olympic games.",

Depending on the country and/or culture in which one resides, being an older adult can be celebrated or stereotyped as chronically ill, useless, or uninterested, as well as by other demeaning characteristics. Members of the LGBTQ community may have arrived at stages of older adulthood after experiencing life-long marginalization within a heteronormative environment, geographical location and/or social groups throughout their development. Thus, older LGBTQ adults can be subject to varied levels of bias and oppression which may ultimately impact their “aging well.” This paper will explore the role of marginalization on the aging-well process among older LGBTQ populations as well as underscore resilience, coping and adaptation within this rapidly expanding and diverse community.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Evidence is presented in the spheres of intelligence, personality and scholastic achievement, as well as physical growth, which indicates that individual growth is usually much more variable than is commonly accepted. The contrary view rests upon a misinterpretation of the implications of correlation coefficients in longitudinal studies. Group data of high statistical significance are likely to include minorities who may make marked changes of status over time. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved. The paper also summarises work on both extreme and subtle environmental agencies, considering in particular current programmes of psycho‐social and educational intervention with disadvantaged children. It is concluded that there is currently an over‐emphasis on the importance of early experience and early psychological growth. Later experiences are the more important, and even education cannot always arrange for individual development to be necessarily consistent. RÉSUMAEA Permanence et variations dans ia croissance des caractéristiques humaines Des évidences sont présentées dans les sphères de I'intelligence, la personnalité et la scolarisation aussi bien que dans la croissance physique qui indique que la croissance individuelle est habituellement beaucoup plus variable qu'il n'est communément admis. Le point de vue contraire repose sur une mauvaise interprétation des conséquences des coefficients de corrélation dans les études longitudinales. Des données sur des groupes, hautement significatives sur le plan statistique, comprennent vraisemblablement des minorités qui peuvent présenter des variations importantes dans le temps. Les facteurs génétiques et d'environnement sont tout deux impliqués. L'auteur conclut qu'il y a couram‐ment surestimation de l'influence des expériences précoces et du développement psycholo‐gique initial. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Stabilität ind Variabilität in Wachstum und Entwicklung beim Menschen In den Bereichen Intelligenz, Persönlichkeit und Schulleistungen, sowie körperliches Wachstum fand man Hinweise darauf, daß die individuelle Entwicklung im allgemeinen sehr viel variabler ist als in der Regel angenommen wird. Die gegenteilige Meinung beruht auf einer falschen Interpretation der Schlußfolgerung von Korrelationskoeffizienten bei Langzeitstudien. Gruppendaten mit hoher statistischer Signifikanz können Minderheiten enthalten, die möglicherweise später das Bild verändern. Daran sind genetische und Umweltfaktoren beteiligt. Man kommt zu der Überzeugung, daß der Wichtigkeit der frühzeitgen Erfahrung und der frühen psychologischen Entwicklung augenblicklich übermäßige Bedeutung beigemessen wird. RESUMEN Consistencia y variabilidad en el crecimiento de las caracteristicas humanas Se presenta evidencia en las esferas de la inteligencia, personalidad y realización escolar, asi como de crecimiento físico, que indica que el crecimiento individual es habitualmente mucho màs variable de lo que corrientemente se acepta. La visión contraria descansa sobre la interpretación errÓnea de las implicaciones de 10s coeficientes de correlatión en estudios longitudinales. Las cifras de grupos de alto significado estadístico es fàCId que incluyan minorias que pueden hacer marcados cambios a lo largo del tiempo. Están implicados tanto factores genÉticos como ambientales.

A key factor in accepting or rejecting this line of research is the current, de facto, competition between biological science and moral and religious creeds in shaping a frame or image of the moral status of the embryo, either as a pure biological entity or, alternatively, as an actual or potential human being entitled to special protection.",

Many suicide attempts seem to be caused by factors other than depression, and the attack on the body may relate to conflicts over sexual rivalry and competition. Anger and aggression exist in all human beings, though these may remain buried, as in some passive, quiet children who may give an impression of meekness and gentility. A possible outcome is, therefore, the attempted self-destruction by the adolescent of his own body, it is as if his body is held responsible for his unbearable thoughts or his guilt feelings, or for the physical sensations that he experiences. The extent of guilt that exists is never easy to assess in any individual, but the breaking-point may be much closer in vulnerable young people than may seem to be the case at first glance.",

      "title": "437 - The elderly and their sexuality: specific challenges and the roleof the psychiatrist",
      "abstract": "Abstract The model of sexuality currently in force is a young, genitalized model, that does not tolerate failures and often forgets about affective communication, sharing and body contact. This model is also not compatible with the natural aging process, generating manymyths about sexuality in later life. Although a taboo subject, the majority (up to 70%) of healthy 70-year-olds revealedthemselves to be sexually active even with some sexual dysfunction reports. Low sexual desire (up to 43%) was the most prevalent reported sexual difficulty in women, and erectiledifficulties (up to 37%) were most prevalent among men. Aging impacts sexuality in various ways: age-related organic/metabolic changes in men and women; age-related affective and cognitive changes also in both genders; age-and duration-related changes in a couple’s dynamic interaction, which can lead to discrepancy between the partners and their sexual narratives. In the sexual response cycle, aging affects the stages of desire, arousal/excitement,plateau, orgasm, and resolution/refractory period both men and women. Depressed mood as well as the use of antidepressant drugs, deterioration of cognitive function and difficulties to communicate can cause loss of intimacy and emotional closeness which then may result in sexual withdrawal and difficulties. Repetitive experiences of failure increase even more the couple distress. There are also to consider medical conditions, medication side effects, loss of physical capacity, subjective loss of attractiveness, lack of a partner, institutionalization or living withtheir children, which can be obstacles to sexual activity in the elderly. Diagnostic workup has to integrate not only general medical, gynecological, urological andpsychiatric factors, but also take a systemic perspective which deals with the interaction pattern of the partners. Treatment of sexual dysfunctions in later life combines biomedical interventions with psychotherapeutic and psychosocial strategies. An essential therapeutic contribution for allcouples is, however, basic counseling and psychoeducation. Explaining how aging has an impact and how other individuals and couples experience these changes is an important step in empowering the couple, clarifying and correcting the sociocultural myths andencouraging the couple to build their very own sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Bulimia is presented as a way young women negotiate the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Developmental demands for more independence place gender-specific demands on young women. The primary identification of the female child with the mother, along with familial and cultural expectations of women, encourage the development of traditionally feminine qualities. In emotionally \"needy\" families these relational qualities are developed at the expense of autonomous capacities. Coupled with the cultural overvaluation of women's appearance in general, and unrealistic expectations of slenderness in particular, the body becomes the focus of conflict, and eating problems often develop. Bulimia is viewed as an effort to make up for the lack of inner sources of self-esteem by living up to external ideals of perfection.",

      "abstract": "Occupational Health (OH) is dedicated not only to prevent diseases but also to promote health in its global dimension, including the spiritual wellbeing. This dimension must not be confused with mental wellbeing or religious beliefs, since it refers to intangible assets and deep feelings such as ethics, compassion, dignity, tolerance, engagement, inclusiveness, sustainability and individual growth among others. In this respect, spirituality is complementary to the other dimensions of wellbeing at work such as the physical, mental and social ones. Though this dimension has not been much studied in the field of Occupational Health up to now, it is more and more an emerging demand from people willing to give sense to their life by allowing these intangible assets to become factors of their wellbeing at work and in their private life. Surveys in Europe have shown that the young generation prefers a meaningful job than a lucrative one. The meaningfulness of work strongly depends on its coherence with the fundamental values of individuals. Moreover, it has been shown that the 'Sense of Coherence', the basic concept of Salutogenesis – science focusing on factors that support human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease – is closely linked with 'good health' and implicitly related to spiritual values of individuals. Therefore, it becomes more and more obvious that OH has to open to this new field of research and to the transfer of these new factors into practice. And the Science of Management too has opened its research on its spiritual dimension for many years now, as illustrated by the Spiritual Division of their international Academy of Management. New forms of management focusing on care (benevolent leadership for example) belong to these emerging issues that OH should promote and develop since they contribute to set up healthy and productive workplaces.",

      "title": "Stigmatisering ved svær overvægt",
      "abstract": "Stigma er et oldgræsk ord for »mærke«. Ordet henviser oprindeligt til et brændemærke eller en tatovering, der blev påført f.eks. kriminelle, krigsfanger og slaver, så man nemt kunne identificere dem som personer med dårlig moral eller af ringe social status. I moderne sprogbrug betegner stigma og stigmatisering dog typisk en social devaluering af personer pga. forskellige former for afvigelse fra de sociokulturelle normer. Stigmatisering kan defineres på flere forskellige måder, men generelt fremhæves, at stigmatisering er en sociokulturel proces, hvor mennesker bliver kategoriseret negativt pga. bestemte karakteristika eller egenskaber (f.eks. hudfarve, seksualitet, religion eller livsstil). Denne negative kategorisering kan føre til stereotypisering, diskrimination, eksklusion og tab af værdighed, respekt og status for det stigmatiserede individ. Stigmatisering af både børn, unge og voksne med svær overvægt, dvs. med BMI over 30 kg/m2, er et udbredt fænomen verden over. Mange videnskabelige studier dokumenterer, at personer med svær overvægt udsættes for omfattende fordomme og diskrimination (dvs. forskelsbehandling) pga. deres vægt og kropssammensætning. Stigmatisering af personer med svær overvægt bunder som regel i stereotypiske fordomme, der ofte tager udgangspunkt i, at svær overvægt anses for at være primært selvforskyldt. Personer med svær overvægt tillægges derfor en lang række negative egenskaber, som f.eks. dumhed, dovenskab samt manglende selvdisciplin og viljestyrke. I Danmark – som i mange andre lande og kulturer - fremhæves den slanke krop som idealet, både i forhold til sundhed, skønhed og succes, og den svært overvægtige krop kommer dermed til at fremstå som antitesen til disse kulturelle idealer.",

      "title": "Are Women More Vulnerable to Environmental Pollution?",
      "abstract": "Environmental health of women is compounded by biological factors and social circumstances like poverty, gender inequality and gender invisibility. This paper explores biological differences with respect to chemical hazards. Biological differences abound on all levels of organization, from the molecular level to the brain. Gender differences in toxicity have been reported for many substances. Most research into chronic toxicity and gender has been directed at reproductive health and reproductive cancers. Reproductive effects on offspring quality have been reported for both sexes and can have multigenerational effects. Uptake, transport, metabolism, storage, and excretion account for many differences in internal exposure. There are also inherent differences in toxic response. Many differences are influenced by sex steroids. There is a general dearth of data, in particular with regard to environmental contaminants. Because of a general synergy between toxic substances and infectious diseases, environmental pollution aggravates the burden of disease in a more than disproportional way. This is not accounted for in the health statistics. Regulation of female immune system differs from men. Most autoimmune disorders show strong gender disparity, and for some autoimmune diseases environmental or occupational exposures are known risk factors. A good strategy would be to systematically research important pollutants like pesticides and blacklisted substances for gender differences, or explore diseases with strong gender disparity for environmental risk factors. It is recommended to give equal priority to chemical hazards and infectious diseases and address them simultaneously. Given the long-term and often multigenerational effects on population health, it is paramount to specifically include women.",

This life stage marks the transition from the social and physical characteristics of juveniles to those of an adult. This is an extensive phase in many primates when hormonally induced physiological, morphological, and behavioral maturations occur at different rates. Puberty results in a nonsynchronous pattern of maturity in reproductive, skeletal, and dental anatomy, body mass, and behavior that ultimately results in adulthood. Timing of puberty in primates can be influenced by demographic, ecological, and social factors. Using a life history framework, it is evident that this period of development is critical for the social, physical, sexual, and neurological development of primates.",

There are indications that concepts and concerns related to quality of life in older ages are different from the general population. A narrative review of selected literature. Quality of life is described often with both objective and subjective dimensions. The majority of the elderly people evaluate their quality of life positively on the basis of social contacts, dependency, health, material circumstances and social comparisons. Adaptation and resilience might play a part in maintaining good quality of life. Although there are no cultural differences in the subjective dimension of quality of life, in the objective dimension such differences exist. Two major factors to be considered with regard to quality of life in old age are dementia and depression. With all other influences controlled, ageing does not influence quality of life negatively; rather a long period of good quality of life is possible. Therefore, the maintenance and improvement quality of life should be included among the goals of clinical management.",

      "title": "Hunger, craving and appetite",
      "abstract": "Obesity is on the rise. It costs, and it kills, big time. Millions are invested in research, experts conduct countless studies, meet, write and discuss, more millions are invested in lifestyle intervention and education measures and still, apparently, we are reduced to helplessly watching modern Western societies overeat, fail to move and suffer from the consequences. Such a number of both popular and scholarly articles has been generated that even without much deliberate cherry-picking, culprits can be found and identified, with educational deficits, common genetic aberrations or the pharmaceutical/entertainment/food industry among the popular ones. It is understood that the pleasure generated from food intake is the result of a central integrative process. Although certain singular taste qualities such as sweet or bitter may evoke immediate spontaneous responses,1 this integration takes into account the taste of the food and both the physiological state of the and associative history of the eating individual (reviewed in ref. 2). Dopamine is a central player in the stimulation of the central reward system, which seems capable of overriding homoeostatic satiety. Peptide neurotransmitters are critically involved in appetite regulation. While several studies suggest Neuropeptide Y as an ideal candidate for pharmaceutical intervention, robust results from human studies would be needed to further establish its role therein.3, 4 Hunger, appetite and/or craving do, when used as search words in common journal databases, yield vast numbers of results and are, at the same time, prime examples of the fact that, with many useful and proven animal models at hand, man is not a mouse after all. Why add another article, rather than focussing on ‘What's new? We had a look at recent contributions from our discipline, physiological research, and their potential impact on the big picture. Even if we disregard the influence of mood and learned associations, complex intricate networks regulate the intake into and processing of nutrients in the human body. Neurons sense nutrients, while these sensing and signalling networks are disturbed in obesity.5-7 Lipid disposition and anabolism are controlled by metabolic mediators and hormones, balance mechanisms which are also affected in overweight individuals.8-10 In addition to the individual's own associative history, there is solid evidence of metabolic foetal programming.11, 12 Interestingly, gut bacteria have been shown to influence appetite and food cravings13, 14 and contribute to the development and progression of eating disorders.15 Pathogenic pathways relate body weight and lung disease. While obesity contributes to the development and progression of several chronic pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive disorders,16, 17 respiratory failure leads to pulmonary cachexia, which, in turn, negatively affects morbidity and mortality.18 Physical activity is one of the main lifestyle factors obese patients seem to benefit from.19, 20 A number of currently ongoing research projects elucidate the mechanisms behind its beneficial effects.21, 22 These effects seem to go far beyond an immediate increase in energy expenditure towards movement and positively affect primary and secondary pathophysiological effects of obesity and obesity-related disease.23-25 Food high in calories and salt is easily and cheaply accessible to most consumers in Western economies, while serving sizes increase and time spent preparing food continuously decreases. At the same time, adult obesity rates in the United States have surpassed 30%, with other Western economies following suit. Another lifestyle intervention therefore targets food preparation methods in favour of home cooking over convenience foods. One could have assumed that the individual interest in (and time spent preparing) food might be positively related to an increased enjoyment of food, intake of energy and thus obesity, but research results are telling us otherwise. A recent systematic review shows beneficial effects of home cooking in observational studies.26 Dopaminergic pathways, especially the mesolimbic axis, are activated by rewarding stimuli. Dopamine is critically involved in mammalian appetite regulation. Recent advances in non-invasive functional imaging, for example functional magnetic resonance imaging, permit intriguing insights into the activation of the reward system in obese patients. While in some obese patients elevated dopaminergic activity upon viewing appetizing images has been found, Dopamine D2 receptors were reduced in obese subjects relative to lean controls. It has thus been assumed that reward regions, namely the dorsal striatum are less responsive to ‘food rewards’ in obese individuals as compared to normal weight controls. A reduction in dopamine receptor density and decreased dopamine signalling is assumed to prompt these obese individuals to overeat, attempting to compensate for this reward deficit.27 Further results are even indicating a secondary downregulation of the dopaminergic reward system in response to an overconsumption of high-fat and high-sugar foods.27 The term ‘food addiction’ has already found its way into lay literature, considering the effects of high-calorie, industrial convenience foods overriding the satiety response. The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest, although both authors enjoy cooking.",

El trabajo actual se centra en el estudio de las desapariciones con desenlace suicida en función del sexo y la edad de la persona desaparecida. Para ello, se ha realizado un análisis del método empleado, entorno utilizado y distancia recorrida por la persona, intentando establecer si existe una asociación entre las variables. Los resultados muestran que los hombres tienden a utilizar el ahorcamiento y los entornos boscosos, desplazándose mayores distancias, mientras que las mujeres recorren una menor distancia destacando la sobredosis como método predilecto. No se han encontrado resultados concluyentes en cuanto a método y entorno según la edad del individuo pero si se ha observado que la distancia recorrida es menor cuanto mayor edad tiene el desaparecido.

      "abstract": "Data from a survey of currently mated women in Lima, Peru, and a highland Peruvian town indicate a positive relation between social class and number of children desired but a negative relation between class and previous thought or discussions of family size. Lower-class preferences for small families may fail to be activated because of various misperceptions of fertility and mortality. In particular, the lower classes tend to overestimate average fertility and average ideal family size and to view fertility and mortality as unchanging or increasing.",

      "abstract": "BY EXERCISING, EVERYONE CAN LOOK LIKE ADONIS. Although exercise offers a wide array of benefits, such as firming up the body, it cannot transform everyone into the aesthetically alluring person of their dreams. Health outcomes aside, being physically active will not alter a person’s basic genetics. In reality, most of an individual’s looks and appearance are genetically determined at birth. PEOPLE WHO DO NOT EXERCISE REGULARLY ARE INHERENTLY LAZY. Although being lazy is an attribute frequently put forth as why sedentary people are not physically active, such an observation is often too simplistic. In fact, an individual’s inactivity may be the result of a variety of factors. For example, a person may view exercise as either pointless or too difficult to start at this stage of their life. Furthermore, an individual may perceive exercise as an endeavor only to be undertaken by others—particularly those who are already relatively fit. Regardless of why someone does not exercise, one of the roles of health/fitness professionals is to educate, inspire, and motivate that person into making an appropriate lifestyle change. THE MORE MONEY SOMEONE SPENDS ON THEIR HEALTH/FITNESS, THE BETTER THE RESULTS WILL BE. Perhaps, but not likely. Needlessly spending money may be common among some people, but doing so is simply wasteful. For example, overpriced workout gear will not make exercising more beneficial. Similarly, over-the-market-priced health care will not necessarily lead to better health-related outcomes. The point to remember is that as the saying goes, “money can’t buy happiness,” it also cannot guarantee sound judgment or optimal results. TIME VALIDATES LONG-HELD BELIEFS ABOUT HEALTH/FITNESS. Not necessarily so. Some, it may; others, not so much. In reality, there are a number of health/fitness-related myths that have endured since time eternal that simply have no basis in fact. As such, they have been passed down over the years, to a point where they are accepted as gospel by individuals who are either unwilling or incapable of searching for the truth (e.g., think of the exercise-related myth “more is better”). THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF AGING ARE INEVITABLE. Not true. In reality, aging (as people commonly know it) can be a choice. As such, many of the presumed consequences of living a longer life (e.g., impaired gait, diminished level of fitness, etc.) are not due to aging but rather a decision (conscious or not) to be less physically active. Accordingly, the resultant sedentary lifestyle leads to a variety of allegedly age-related physical decrements. THE MORE COMPLICATED THE EXERCISE REGIMEN, THE BETTER THE OUTCOMES. Not true, as a rule. All factors considered, exercise is both straightforward and relatively simple. As such, the human body responds to the stresses imposed on it in a fairly predictable manner. Regrettably, some people insist on making exercise too complicated—either because they do not know any better or because they’re trying to massage their own egos, attempting to equate complexity with wisdom. EXPERTS KNOW WHAT THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT; OTHERWISE, THEY WOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS “EXPERTS.” Some do; many do not. In reality, a number of these self-proclaimed authoritative pundits do not have a knowledge-based command of their subject matter. What they do possess is an innate ability and willingness to con an unsuspecting public. FAD DIETS PROMOTE BIG RESULTS. As a rule, these dietary regimens promise amazing results, such as quick loss. In reality, with regard to weight loss diets, most individuals can lose weight on almost any dietary plan. The key is to sustain the loss and to do so without compromising the person’s health. These diets utterly fail on both counts. EXERCISE-RELATED INJURIES ONLY AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE. Truth be known, no one is invincible. Even hardcore exercise enthusiasts can be injured if they unduly stress their bodies. The key for exercisers is to be aware of and watch for signs that they may be working out too strenuously, either in the early stages of their exercise regimen or over the long haul. Among the symptoms of possible danger on the exercise front are inordinate levels of lethargy, poor sleep, aching muscles, irritability, and loss of appetite. EXERCISE BURNS A LOT OF CALORIES. In reality, most people overestimate the number of calories they expend while exercising. As such, in a 30-minute workout, the average person expends between 240 to 355 calories—about a half dozen small chocolate chip cookies or a single serving of potato chips. In other words, although exercise should be an integral part of an individual’s efforts to achieve a desirable level of weight, it takes a lot of exercise to burn a lot of calories",

From a physical and psychological point of view, female workers have greater exposure to low strength, repetitive motion of upper extremities that causes gender disparity with its health consequences. This chapter documents a study where females were found to have lower biomechanical negative effects in the upper extremities compared to similar male exposures and a higher rate of productivity, especially in tasks of low force demand. This can be attributed to the fact that men used more strength than what was strictly necessary to accomplish the task, mobilizing a greater number of muscle groups than women; females also showed a greater resilience to conditions of high repetitiveness that demanded high-quantitative psychological demands and still maintain productivity rates over time, evidencing also lower rates of rotation and absenteeism caused by musculoskeletal disorders.",

What is the status of the woman, of her partner, of that which was lost? Why did it happen? What does it mean? How ought one to behave? The dominant strategy in the United States for dealing with this ambiguity is to minimize the loss. Medical explanations stress how common such events are, how insignificant they are in terms of predicting the outcome of a subsequent pregnancy, and indeed how beneficial such losses are – “nature's way of taking care of itself.” Family, friends, and co-workers, people who may have celebrated the pregnancy and joined in the co-construction of the incipient personhood of “the baby,” sometimes respond to the loss by acting as if nothing happened, as if the woman had never even been pregnant. Those who do acknowledge the loss often minimize its importance with comments like, “It was only a miscarriage,” “At least you didn't get to know her,” “You can always have another,” “It was for the best.” Members of pregnancy loss support groups move against this current and often forcefully assert their status as parents and that which was lost as a “baby,” a legitimate source of grief.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction has become the catch-all for infidelity, cheating, promiscuity, and rape. Recently it has become the newest claim for rapists and child molesters. Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

Results showed that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past often had less active, less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The group that experienced a physical illness formed an exception, showing more supportive and active sibling ties, but also higher levels of conflict. Results suggest inequality between persons who have experienced negative life events and those who have not in terms of access to positive and supportive sibling relationships.",

      "abstract": "In this article, results of a qualitative study in relation to Situation Selection as an emotional regulation strategy in different age groups are shown. The emotional regulation is a process whereby people seek to redirect the course of their emotions. The selection or avoidance of situations is one of these strategies. Faced with an emotionally intense situation, either negative or positive, and from a subjective assessment, subjects anticipate the likely emotional consequences. This can trigger selection or avoidance strategies. The efficacy of this process is based on a balance between search for wellbeing and avoidance of discomfort, in a way that predominantly the result is emotionally positive. Different studies suggest that older people tend, more than younger people, to de seek of maintenance and a predominance of a positive emotionality. The results obtained in this study show common aspects as regard to selection strategy. However, some differences appear. In youth, others attitudes is a source of negative emotions. In middle-age, family problems and political opinions are source of rage. In older people, everything that refers to the negative aspects of ageing, such as sickness and passivity, is avoided. The avoidance in older people doesn’t imply a scape, but rather neutralization or balance between their social compromise and their emotional equilibrium.",

      "abstract": "Health is defined as a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity [World health organization, 1948]. Defining health as the absence of illness, health is recognized to be an achievement involving balance among physical, mental and social well-being. Physical health is inextricably interwoven with psychological and social environment. All conditions of health and illness, not just the disease, identified by the early psychosomatic theorists are influenced by psychological and social factors. The mind and the body cannot be meaningfully separated in matters of health and illness. This article defines health behaviors as any activity undertaken for the purpose of preventing or detecting disease or for improving health and well-being. Common ways of classifying different health behaviors (e.g., health enhancing, health compromising) are examined. Prevalence of key health behaviors (smoking, diet, exercise, screening, sexual behaviors, alcohol use) in different groups and their relationship to morbidity and mortality is reported. This presentation highlights the role of cognitive variables (such as health beliefs, attitudes, self- efficacy) as described in psychological models in understanding the distribution/prevalence of health behaviors and the use of such models in changing health behaviors.",

This review summarizes the content of the symposium, \"International Comparison of Body Image,\" which was part of the 15th International Congress of Dietetics held in Yokohama, Japan, on September 8 to 11, 2008. Body image is a term that refers to one's perception of his/her own physical appearance and how that body appears to others. A negative body image usually has unfavorable consequences, such as the development of an eating disorder. The desire for thinness is widespread, even in non-Western countries. For example, young Japanese women have an even stronger desire to be thin than their American or Vietnamese counterparts. Abnormal eating behaviors are common among adolescents in both Western and non-Western countries. Therefore, we should monitor inappropriate weight loss attempts, especially by adolescents in all countries Young Asian women have their body image problems too",

We find no evidence linking self-control to attitudes towards weak forms of paternalism (e.g., nudges or information about health consequences). But respondents with good self-control are significantly more favourable towards strong paternalism (e.g., restricting choices or sin taxes) than those struggling with self-control.",

Mi­nority men seek to and successfully embody US-cultural and ethnic-specific aspects of manhood in their daily lives by engaging in behaviors that constantly reaffirm their gen­der identity through a complex internal and social calculus that varies by intra-personal characteristics and context. Manhood and health are relational constructs that highlight how the salience of masculinities are shaped by perceived and actual social norms and expectations. A life course perspective adds a framework for considering how some gendered beliefs, goals and behaviors change over time while others remain static. Three life course frameworks highlight dif­ferent mechanisms through which minority men’s life experiences and physiological and behavioral responses to gendered social norms, beliefs and expectations become embodied as premature mortality and other health outcomes over the life course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/strong&gt;Manhood represents an impor­tant lens to understand how minority men’s identities, goals and priorities affect their health, yet the role of manhood in minority men’s health is understudied and under­developed. To achieve health equity, it is critical to consider how manhood shapes minority men’s lives and health across the life course, and to address how man­hood affects gendered and non-gendered mechanisms and pathways that explain minority men’s health over time. &lt;em&gt;Ethn Dis. &lt;/em&gt;2015;25(3):287-293.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Fear of nuclear war is correlated with fears of other technological hazards, and these seem as unlikely to disappear of their own accord as the radioactive waste products from nuclear weapons production. Teenagers' worries about nuclear war covaried with concerns about the environment and getting cancer, rather than with fears about parents dying or personal injury or death. The implications of using words such as \"resistance\" or \"numbing\" are that lack of worry about nuclear war should be associated with poor mental health. As in the case of theory and research on the responses of the general public to the threat of nuclear war opposing perspectives in the literature on decision makers' responses to threat. The totality of evidence supports the operation of some unconscious defensive processes with respect to fear of nuclear war. The notion of unconscious defenses has been a major source of confusion and controversy in psychology.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in research related to compulsive, excessive, or out-of-control sexual behaviors. Yet, little is known about which behaviors people might experience as compulsive. Using YouGov America, a non-probability sample was collected, matched to U.S. representative norms, stratified, and weighted based on sample characteristics to ensure representativeness (N = 2,806; Mean Age = 48.9, SD = 17.3). Participants reported if they had experienced any concerns about their sexual behaviors being either \"out of control\" or \"an addiction.\" Participants who endorsed such concerns were then asked to indicate which behaviors had led to such concerns, using a checklist of 11 potentially overlapping sexual behaviors (e.g. frequent casual sexual encounters, using apps to find sexual partners). Men—both heterosexual and gay/bi/other–were more likely to report concerns that their sexual behaviors were an addiction, relative to heterosexual women. Relative to heterosexual women, men of any sexual orientation were more likely to report pornography use as a specific behavior of concern, and less likely to report partnered sexual behaviors. More religious participants were more likely to endorse masturbation as a behavior of concern and less likely to endorse frequent casual sexual encounters.",

      "title": "THE PROBLEM OF CO-DEPENDENCY AS A LACKING SENSE OF INTERNAL SELF-IMPORTANCE",
      "abstract": "The article reveals the problem of co-dependency as a lacking sense of internal self-importance. The problem of co-dependency which is being raised by psychiatrists, drug treatment specialists, psychologists, neurologists is increasingly actualized due to every year expansion and deepening of chemical addiction scale. The article exposes the concept of co-dependency, examines the psychological component of a personality that seeks to control the behavior of others rather than care about the satisfaction of his own vital needs. A co-dependent person ceases to distinguish between his own needs and goals and the goals and needs of his loved ones. Feelings and interaction methods circle around, inevitably bringing the individual back to reproducing the same mistakes, problems and failures. The article emphasizes that any significant relationship generates a certain amount of emotional co-dependency, since letting our loved ones in our life, we will surely respond to their emotional state and one way or another, adjust ourselves to their lifestyles, tastes, habits and needs. However, healthy or mature relationship always leaves enough space for meeting our own needs, achieving personal goals and individual personal development. Psychoactive substance addiction is a family disease that is why addiction therapy system should include not only drug addiction treatment, but also co-dependency treatment. Help is required for the patient, as well as his wife, parents and other relatives living together with him. Addictive behavior correction program can not purport to be effective without the representation of a personalized approach directed at a specific addict and his family. The emphasis on the significance of this position is extremely important at the initial stage of correction, drug addicts differ in addiction development degree. Keywords: co-dependency, need, value, personality disorder, adaptation disorder, controlling behavior, scope of emotions, external evaluation.

      "abstract": "SURVIVAL of premature infants, even with the best of care, is conditioned by intrinsic factors of which the single most important is stage of maturity. In practice, the objective measure of maturity is weight at birth, although relation between weight and maturity is affected very strongly by factors such as sex, race, socio-economic status and whether or not the birth was plural. It has been amply demonstrated that at a given weight at birth, female babies are more mature than males, Negro babies (at least in the U.S.A.) are more mature than white, children born to parents of lower socio-economic status more mature than those of the higher levels, and plural births more mature than single births. Thus it follows for race, in the U.S.A., as an example, that, regardless of care given, a Negro baby of, for instances, 1800 grams would have a distinctly greater chance of survival than a white baby of the same weight. The same observation is true for the other factors cited. Clearly it is impossible to compare statistics for one group of premature infants and another unless the experience of each sub-group is compared individually or some statistical means is taken to compensate for differences in composition. Several modifications of the technique of statistical standardization have been proposed for the latter although it has been the opinion of this editor that a simpler approach might be focusing attention on specific rates for white and Negro babies, separately, in one or two weight groups, e.g., 1500 to 2000 grams.",

      "abstract": "Short stature, per se, is clearly not a disease, but is commonly perceived to be associated with social and psychological disadvantage. The assumption, widely held by pediatricians that short children are likely to be significantly affected by their stature, has been founded largely on older, poorly designed clinic-based studies and laboratory investigations of beliefs about the association between stature and individual characteristics. In contrast, data from more recent and better designed clinic- and community-based studies show that, in terms of psychosocial functioning, individuals with short stature are largely indistinguishable from their peers, whether in childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Parents and children alike should be reassured by these findings. In the absence of clear pathology, physical or psychological, GH therapy for the short but otherwise normal child raises ethical concerns about so-called 'cosmetic endocrinology'.",

Under the dominance of the Shadow archetype of personality, some individual adolescents show signs of anxiety, depression, and this state begins to dominate their Ego, an archetype that testifies to Self-identity and Self-awareness of the ‘I’, which can lead to loss of control over their behavior. Young students — boys show a correlation between the anima scales and the self. ‘Self’ as an archetype of personality, affecting the development and formation of personality of an individual, indicates the existence of a strong direct relationship between these scales, that is, with high Self-indicators of ‘Self’, high indicators of the anima scale are demonstrated. A statically significant relationship is found between the ego and Self-scales, as well as between the Shadow and Self-scales.

But in reality, in social life, a woman often gets inhumane treatment, be it in public life or domestic life, is treated rudely, and impressed as not considered, women are very vulnerable to violence, whether physical violence, psychic violence, violence sexual even neglect of household. Or even men do not respect women in the realm of the outside or inside the dwelling. Result in a significant difference to gender equality itself. The most important and protected women's rights are freedom, being treated equally in the eyes of law, teaching and education is absolute, as well as health, legal certainty and justice and legal certainty. Social ethics arises in everyone, according to their nature and character. Human nature can be seen from their actions in treating and respecting others, especially treating the opposite sex, not in accordance with ethics and social sense, then the person is considered disrespectful to others. The literature study is the method used in this study is to have a purpose to know gender and its equality be the cause of violence against women, and its relation to social ethics. The result is a patriarchal culture that assumes that men as rulers, while women are in a weak position or are perceived as \"male\" owners, and social ethics greatly affect respect for women, where social ethics strongly determines one's behavior and how to respect and respect for women's rights.",

      "title": "Belonging, Respectful Inclusion, and Diversity in Medical Education",
      "abstract": "Belonging is the experience of being accepted, included, and valued by others. A fundamental human motivation, belonging positively influences an individual's health, abilities, relationships, and overall well-being.1 Belonging is an interpretation of cues that suggests that one fits in and is welcome in a given context; it is an inference based on observations, interactions, values, and past events that define the culture and environment.2 Encountering discrimination, exclusionary practices, bias, and microaggressions interferes with the experience of belonging. Uncertainty about belonging, or worse, certainty of not belonging can contribute to isolation, diminished capacity for trust, emotional distress, lessened effectiveness, exhaustion, and serious health issues.2–5 Individuals who identify as members of underrepresented groups can be profoundly and disproportionately affected by these concerns.3 Respectful inclusion in the health professions of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds, identities, and life experience is increasingly understood for its primacy in preparing an innovative and representative workforce, addressing health disparities, advancing science, and serving the needs of the public.6,7 Respectful inclusion is vital to the future of medicine and requires new ideas and new practices, as illustrated very thoughtfully in several articles8–17 appearing in this issue of Academic Medicine. Committing to a more diverse and vibrant future requires self-honesty, creativity, and courage in tackling aspects of the culture of medicine that may interfere with people from all backgrounds feeling welcomed, included, and valued—namely, feeling that they truly belong. Belonging Cues Individuals may experience certain aspects of medical education as threats to a secure sense of belonging. For example, the populations of students and faculty of U.S. medical schools do not reflect our country's general population. Poor representation or nonrepresentation may suggest that some people are valued over others in the culture of medicine. This year, for the first time, women outnumber men enrolled in medical school,18 with a gender balance that more closely matches that of the general population. And yet, individuals enrolled in medical school in 2019–2020 identify as 50% white, 22% Asian, 7% black or African American, and 7% Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin,18 while the U.S. population identifies as 60% non-Hispanic white, 6% Asian, 13% black or African American, and 18% Hispanic or Latino.19 Decades of effort to promote diversity in admissions have led to uneven results. To illustrate, between 1980 and 2016, the proportion of black or African American medical school matriculants rose only slightly, from 6% to 7%, and the proportion of Hispanic matriculants rose from 5% to 6%. American Indian/Alaska Native matriculants declined to 0.3% in 2016 from 0.4% in 1980, despite increasing year after year in the general population.20 In 2018–2019, 24 of 53 applicants who identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander were accepted to medical schools, and 44 of 109 who identified as Alaska Native/American Indian were accepted.21 Postgraduate medical education overall tends to be more diverse, especially in primary care fields, although certain fields of training22 are very narrow in terms of demographic characteristics. Bringing greater representation to all specialty fields poses challenges. In 2019, for example, there were more black or African American and Hispanic applicants to family medicine programs than to dermatology, neurology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, radiation oncology, and urology combined.23 The composition of medical school faculty is evolving, with greater numbers and proportions of women and individuals who identify as traditionally underrepresented in medicine (URiM), especially among earlier career faculty members.24,25 That said, in a recent survey26 inquiring about the major professional activity of medical school faculty members, only 516 individuals who identified as black or African American reported medical teaching as their primary focus, and only 294 reported research. In this survey, only 2 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander individuals reported administration as their main professional activity. Persistent underrepresentation of some groups in medical schools may lead to the perception that some groups are less welcome and their presence less supported, impeding the experience of belonging. As noted by Walton et al,27 this perception should not be denied or dismissed, as it is not unjustified: \"it reflects the external world, and the risks a person faces\" when a group that has been historically excluded encounters stereotype threat or, for whatever reason, experiences disadvantage or negative repercussions in a given context. In her essay28 entitled \"A Dark Spot on a White Canvas,\" Dr. Lia Thomas describes this inner experience from when she was a medical student: The thought was there, gnawing in the back of my mind, whispering at me when gross anatomy got tough…. \"You do not really belong here; you took someone else's spot.\" I would not dare voice these feelings to my friends or to my advisors. A part of me was afraid that they would think less of me for feeling inadequate; another part of me knew with certainty that they already knew I was inadequate.28(p455) As Dr. Thomas assumed leadership roles as a faculty member, she felt paradoxically both visible and invisible. When stressed, she found that the voice of lonely self-doubt returned. Did I not know my place? Had my reach exceeded my grasp?…. And, most importantly, where would I belong?28(p456) Baumeister and Leary1(p521) have cautioned that \"cultures use social inclusion to reward, and exclusion to punish, their members as a way of enforcing their values.\" It is no wonder, then, that feeling out of place causes self-critique, isolation, and feelings of being an \"imposter\" in academic medicine. Moreover, in the presence of other factors, ruptured or thwarted belongingness can contribute to heightened risk for physical health problems as well as emotional distress and self-harmful behaviors.5 Better understanding of the role of belonging in medical schools may help us to understand the distinct and often very serious health care needs of URiM students, as documented in a number of empirical studies.29–31 Another barrier to feelings of belonging among medical students is the observation that that learning environments are not free from hostility, exploitation, and unequal treatment, despite efforts to ensure otherwise. The 2019 Medical School Graduate Questionnaire32 (n = 19,933), conducted by the Association of American Medical Colleges, documented that many respondents (23%) had been \"publicly humiliated\" once (13.1%), occasionally (8.8%), or frequently (0.8%) during their undergraduate medical training. Twenty-one percent reported other students being subjected to such behavior. More than 60 respondents reported being asked during medical school to exchange sexual favors for grades or other rewards. Nearly 1,000 respondents reported being denied opportunities for training or rewards based on gender, and more than 1,100 reported receiving lower evaluations or grades based on gender. A total of 8.5% of respondents had personally experienced \"racially or ethnically offensive remarks/names\" once (4.1%), occasionally (3.9%), or frequently (0.5%) in medical school. More than 500 respondents reported being denied opportunities for training or rewards based on race or ethnicity. A similar number reported receiving lower evaluations or grades based on race or ethnicity. A small proportion of respondents overall reported being subjected to offensive remarks/names (2%) or to unequal treatment (0.7%) at least once related to sexual orientation. It is unclear which students had these experiences, but it should be noted that a total of 7.2% of respondents in the survey self-identified as bisexual, gay, or lesbian, and 0.4% stated that they had a different gender identity from the sex assigned at birth. Many respondents did not report negative experiences such as these to their institutions because they felt that nothing could be done or because they were fearful of reprisal.32 Further, demonstrations of respect for diversity by faculty were reported as occurring either never, almost never, or sometimes by 5.4% of respondents. Demonstrations of respect for students by faculty were reported as occurring either never, almost never, or sometimes by 6.5% of respondents. These findings suggest that the learning climate is not yet fully supportive of our students. While some may argue that these percentages have improved over time—and they clearly have—it is important to remember that a trend does not feel wholly relevant for individuals who are directly experiencing humiliation or unequal treatment. Beyond these threats and barriers, the experience of belonging may be affected, positively or negatively, by rituals and signs of recognition and status in the culture of medicine (e.g., honors, awards, invitations, opportunities). Whether evaluations and letters of recommendation predominantly describe personal attributes (as is more common for women and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in medicine) as opposed to strengths and areas of competence (as is more common for men and members of majority groups in medicine) is a cultural signal that influences opportunities for students and reinforces either belonging or exclusion.33 Students who identify as members of underrepresented minority groups in some settings may carry greater financial debt,34,35 may encounter structural barriers to performance on standardized examinations,36,37 and may be at risk for slower progression and greater attrition.38 How such disparities are addressed will affect students' sense of affiliation, safety, and feelings of either being out of place or \"at home.\" The presence of leaders, mentors, and near-peers who identify as members of underrepresented groups, along with perceptions of their scope of responsibility, power, and control or access to resources, can serve as cultural indicators that augment or lessen feelings of belonging. Whether individuals who identify with underrepresented groups are asked to carry disproportionate burdens of service and representation (the \"minority tax\") can be another environmental cue for students.39 The presence of meaningful and relevant policies, along with evidence of their faithful implementation, can serve to communicate a commitment to respectful inclusivity in a given context. For instance, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education40 has 2 standards pertaining to diversity and inclusion. The first states that each medical school must develop programs or partnerships aimed at broadening diversity among qualified applicants for medical school admission. The second states that each medical school must have policies and practices to achieve appropriate diversity among its students, faculty, staff, and other members of its academic community, and must engage in ongoing, systematic, and focused efforts to attract and retain students, faculty, staff, and others from demographically diverse backgrounds. The existence of concrete manifestations of such ideals is very important, including, for example, intentional curriculum design; adequacy of knowledgeable, sensitive, and well-prepared faculty; the existence of all-gender facilities; and the dedication of spaces for individuals with religious and spiritual beliefs or distinct backgrounds. Opportunities to receive specialized resources, financial assistance, career counseling, and culturally attuned health services, along with the absence of physical symbols that are experienced as objectifying certain groups, further fortify the message of respectful inclusion for medical students. Toward a Culture of Belonging, Respectful Inclusion, and Diversity In this issue of Academic Medicine, our authors take on some of the most difficult challenges that pertain to belonging, respectful inclusion, and diversity in medical education. Several articles offer insights into experiential and cultural issues, and some also offer strategies and practical approaches for implementation. Three articles relate to the selection of students for Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA), a prestigious national honors society in medicine. Byyny et al8 of the AOA Honor Medical Society articulate their society's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity, emphasizing humility as expressed in the organization's ideal that its members \"Be Worthy to Serve the Suffering.\" The authors acknowledge that the AOA has certain restrictions (e.g., no more than 16% of a medical school's graduating class can be selected) and yet make clear that each of the 132 AOA chapters at medical schools in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Lebanon have the ability to develop and enact selection criteria for medical students, residents, and physicians at different career stages. In a second article, Teherani et al9 describe how the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine examined and changed selection processes for the school's AOA honor society, adopting holistic review, as one effort among many, to dismantle existing inequitable educational structures. Arguing that selection to the AOA reinforces structural biases and social privilege in medical education and runs counter to core tenets of equity and wellness, a third article by Lynch et al10 describes what many will consider a courageous decision to suspend student selection to the AOA at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The authors state that a return to selection of students for the AOA at Icahn will only occur when all students are treated equitably in medicine. The cultural symbolism and influence of the AOA, and of similar honors, are reflected in these 3 articles. In a remarkable qualitative study performed by Ackerman-Barger et al11 at the University of California Davis School of Medicine and Yale University School of Medicine, medical students and nursing students who identified as members of underrepresented groups were interviewed to better understand the role and effects of racial microaggressions in health professions education. This research report is exceptional for its clarity and thematic organization, its engagement of students in 2 health domains, and its sensitive selection of narrative examples to convey, movingly and richly, students' experiences. This project follows on the past work by Orom et al38 documenting, for example, that URiM students face distinct challenges socially and academically, experience their learning environments as less positive, encounter discrimination and racial harassment, and are more likely to see race as negatively affecting their education. An important contribution of the study by Ackerman-Barger et al is the set of recommendations offered by the students themselves related to diversity and allyship, curriculum change, open conversations, and safe spaces. The insights of trainees in bringing forward respectful inclusion practices in the culture of medicine are invaluable, as seen in the example described elsewhere41 of the innovative adoption of 2 new chief resident roles for diversity and inclusion in one clinical department at Yale University School of Medicine. Cook et al12 consider key issues and relevant resources and provide a set of thoughtful recommendations to help academic institutions develop more respectful, supportive, and attuned approaches to trainees who identify as transgender and nonbinary. The authors comment on administrative challenges and recommendations, touching upon culture, policies, data collection, health and wellness, and gendered spaces, and on educational challenges and opportunities in the classroom, clinical teaching, mentorship, and evaluation activities. The AM Last Page13 in this issue of the journal, entitled \"Creating Affirming Health Care Environments for Patients Who Are Gender Diverse,\" complements the valuable contribution by Cook et al12 and builds on the relatively small literature base on this emerging topic.42,43 In their careful review of 89 published articles, Brottman et al14 sought to understand how health care professionals and medical students learn about topics such as implicit bias, health disparities, and the needs of diverse patient populations. Eleven educational strategies for fostering cultural competence were identified in the articles. Few of the published projects demonstrated favorable outcomes. Similar results have been found in studies of college students, in which some strategies for inclusion resulted in feelings of inauthenticity and exclusion among certain groups, despite their opposite intent.27 The review by Brottman et al highlights the important role of faculty expertise and skill and states that the adoption of more clearly articulated goals and refinement of best practices are needed. That review also serves as a reminder of the value of empirical work in informing curricular innovation and campus interventions. In another article in this issue's collection, Sukhera et al15 suggest that transformational learning theory may serve as a useful lens for advancing education on implicit bias and related topics. Focusing on graduate medical education, Gonzaga et al16 propose an approach for meeting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education standards on creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. The approach features 5 interrelated components: setting diversity as a priority, seeking out candidates, implementing inclusive recruitment practices, investing in trainee success, and building the pipeline. Gardner et al17 describe the use of a new tool, the Situational Judgment Test, in addition to a scoring algorithm, to identify candidates for residency interviews in 7 residency programs. A number of candidates selected in this manner had United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores that previously would not have reached a \"cutoff\" threshold, and the candidates invited for interviews were more diverse than in the past. Respectful inclusion and diversity in health professions education are essential to the learning, well-being, and effectiveness of our early-career colleagues. Respectful inclusion and diversity, furthermore, are essential to the health of the people and populations we are entrusted with serving, now and in the future. The role of belonging in health education, systems, and workforce is also essential, even though that role has thus far been underrecognized. Greater understanding of belonging, Dear Reader, is the key to respectful inclusion and diversity in the health professions. Such understanding will allow us to tackle the hardest issues we together face related to equity and well-being. Laura Weiss Roberts, MD, MA",

Abuse is directed at the same person, it is intentional and conscious behavior.\r\nThree main types of abuse are: physical abuse, emotional abuse and sexual abuse. As forms of violations of children's rights and inadequacy of their needs, which can have the same effects on the child as well as abuse, is neglect. Child abuse can be identified by different signs.\r\nPsysical abuse has clear consequences and if we observe child psysical abuse should be the easiest to identify. Psysical abuse includes hitting, pushing, causing pain, physical restraint, shaking, tightening, biting, scalding, etc. Emotional abuse dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child. Indicators of emotional abuse can be the child's fearfulness, tics, stuttering, insecurity, etc... Sexual abuse includes kissing, touching genitals or breasts, sexual intercourse, oral and anal contact, viewing and showing pornographic magazines and films or other pornographic material. Sexual abuse, same as an emotional abuse, dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child (anxiety, depression, fear of physical contact, etc.) and to injuries in the area of sexual organs.\r\nIt is very important as soon discover that a child is a victim of abuse, and protect it from further exposure to violence, and to report it to the social welfare center. Kindergarten teacher have a very important role in the detection and prevention of violence because she spend a lot of time with children and she (or he), with children, builds trusting relationship.\r\nThe empirical part was about recognized sings of abuse. The kindergarten teachers are very important in a child's life and they need to be sensitive and skilled in tracking and identifying the different signs of violence.",

Economic dependency may be said to be a condition of having to rely upon some source of income which the individual does not earn by his labours or endeavours. The signs by which one can detect psychological dependency are not that the individual gets aid to dependent children, old age assistance, or general assistance. They are, rather, the presence of feelings of resignation, helplessness, hostile pessimism, physical sickness for which doctors can find no organic base, passivity, and inability to mobilize the self to take necessary action or responsibilities.",

Whereas they once thought of themselves as saleswomen entering the marketing industry and adapting the progressivepath for their livelihood, today's women see themselves as housewives caring for domestically dependent family members, giving birth to their children, and keeping themselves constantly busy. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru believed that rather than keeping them busy with home economic affairs, they should constantly be actively participating in the social and political life of the country. Depression symptoms appear when we react negatively to life's circumstances repeatedly, intensely, and frequently. Numerous situations that arise in life cause us to experience both positive and negative emotions, such as enthusiasm, irritation, fear, and happiness. Angry, depressed, happy, etc. All age groups and practically all stages of life are affected by depression. Depression symptoms can appear in people of any age, including toddlers and adults. Depending on the personality type, even modest stressors can trigger depressive symptoms. Stress and depression can create symptoms including extreme melancholy, a lack of interest in anything, difficulty getting to sleep or sleeping too much, feelings of powerlessness, and suicidal thoughts. Women have been working for about 100 years now, in fact. One of the most important issues in society is the employment of women. since women became active in society.

Environmental events associated with old age often place limits on the range of outcomes that are attainable by older people. Moreover, the association between control and indicators of health status may be altered by old age. Finally, old age may influence the relationship between control and various health maintenance behaviors. Aspects of the sense of control can be altered with small interventions that can enhance health specifically and the quality of aging in general. Given the relationship between control and health in old age, several possible factors may help explain or mediate this relationship including mechanisms of behavioral and cognitive change, and physiological adaptations.

This literature review aims to examine the biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors that influence sleep quality, with a focus on gender-based differences. Women are found to have longer sleep latency, higher psychological distress, and a greater prevalence of insomnia symptoms, while men more frequently experience short sleep duration and are at higher risk for sleep apnea. Despite women showing longer total sleep durations and greater amounts of slow-wave sleep in objective measures, they report lower subjective sleep satisfaction. Drawing upon numerous peer-reviewed studies, this review identifies key gender disparities in sleep latency, duration, efficiency, psychological distress, and vulnerability to sleep disorders. It also highlights the role of hormonal variation, stress, lifestyle, and cultural expectations in shaping sleep experiences. Findings suggest that tailored, gender-specific approaches may be critical for improving sleep health in various populations.",

      "abstract": "Although there are many definitions of successful aging in gerontology, no single consensus thereon exists. Successful aging is defined not by longevity alone but also by sufficient wellbeing (in multiple domains) to sustain a capacity for functioning adequately in changing circumstances. The determinants of such well-being and functional status are manifold and include the genetic endowment, physical environment, social environment, population and individual responses to challenges, the occurrence of disease, availability and effectiveness of health care, and personal prosperity. Rowe and Kahn defined it as including three main components: low probability of disease and disease-related disability, high cognitive and physical functional capacity, and active engagement with life. Growth hormone and testosterone seem to play a role in the physical decline that occurs during aging. In addition, both serum IGF-I and testosterone concentrations are related to the presence of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the effect of growth hormone and testosterone replacement on the quality of life has hardly been examined in the elderly population.",

      "title": "Perceived ethnic discrimination, rumination, and hope: implications for sleep quality in minority and non-minority college students",
      "abstract": "There is a vast amount of literature supporting the notion that sleep is vital for the physical and mental health of human beings. Mentally, poor sleep can interfere with cognitive processes and is a risk factor in the development of health problems. Studies exploring racial and ethnic differences in sleep quality suggest that Blacks/African Americans tend to experience poorer sleep (i.e., more sleep disturbance, slow-wave sleep) than their White counterparts, but few studies have examined the mechanism by which minority status (as in the case of Blacks/African Americans) compromises sleep quality. Aside from race and ethnicity, literature states that rumination (i.e., excessive reflecting on life events and stressors) may also influence sleep negatively. Considering this, racially charged events that are increasingly displayed in today’s media have heightened the awareness of unfair treatment based on race and ethnicity. Consequently, Blacks/African Americans (who are prone to discrimination in a variety of societal domains), may experience an additional layer of stress that increases the tendency to ruminate. In contrast, the instillation of hope may decrease rumination, in that a positive outlook and a sense that one’s goals are attainable may overshadow the perception of barriers pertaining to ethnic discrimination. To examine this, data were collected from students attending a Historically Black College/University (HBCU) and a Predominately White Institution (PWI) (N = 295). The aim of the present study was to examine differences in brooding and reflective rumination, perceived ethnic discrimination (PED), hope, stress, and sleep quality in Black/African American and White college students. This study also examined hope as a buffering variable against the negative impact of other study constructs. Independent t-test results indicated that Blacks/African Americans reported worse sleep quality, more disturbed sleep, more brooding rumination, and more overall PED than Whites, which is consistent with the existing literature. In contrast, there were no differences in hope scores between Blacks/African Americans and their White counterparts, and hope was not significant predictor of sleep quality when entered into a regression equation with other study constructs (brooding, reflection, perceived stress, PED, ethnicity, and gender). However, the regression model containing the study constructs found brooding and perceived stress to be predictive of sleep quality, thus suggesting that these constructs are especially pertinent to sleep quality above and beyond other variables. Limitations, implications, and suggestions for future research will be discussed.",

      "title": "Ageing-ethical Issues and Stigma",
      "abstract": "During the twentieth century, many behavioural and biological theories of aging have been advanced that ageing is a multidimensional phenomenon. Ageing is a progressive decline in function and performance, which accompanies advancing years. Cicero noticed that the old people preserved their intellects if they maintained their interests. To the social, economical and medical problems that old age arises to the society, one may add the continue increase of old people proportion in the general population. The ageing of population is becoming a reality in developed and in less developed countries too. We talk about a conceptual definition of normal ageing and also about successful and morbid ageing. Normal ageing is an ageing process without any clinical somatic or mental disorder and a morbid ageing is characterized by a process presenting clinical disorders which affects the somatic and mental health, the successful ageing being an ageing process in a favourable environmental conditions to promote individual development. We can consider not only the presence/absence of a disorder but also its impact in someone's life. The functioning capacity loss could be considered as a marker of the presence of a clinical disorder. Stigma remains a major obstacle to ensuring access to good care for elderly with mental disorders, these patients suffers of a double jeopardy (old age and mental disorders). Both stigma and discrimination against these old persons depend on the type of mental disorder and we have to protect them against discrimination and improve their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Boundary work is important in all social movements, but the instability of bodily-based categories makes boundary work particularly complicated in movements where bodily attributes are key to identity formation. Many Anglo-American fat acceptance groups have attempted to draw boundaries on the basis of two 'ideal fat subjects': one with a stable, unitary 'resisting' consciousness and/or one based on excluding those who are not 'really' fat or fat 'enough.' The former excludes members who display ambiguity or ambivalence in relation to accepting their bodies, while the latter excludes members seen as not fat enough to participate. In contrast, the Israeli fat acceptance community establishes its boundaries based on shared negative social reactions to body size. This increases its ability to tolerate ambiguity and contradictions among members, and to accept members who do not fit into fixed bodily identity categories. Simultaneously, this collective identity poses other problems, like reducing members to their identity as fat and encouraging constant preoccupation with weight or social oppression based on body size.",

      "title": "A perspective on obesity.",
      "abstract": "This article represents another approach to the topic of obesity in African-American women. It will not give the usual statistical data on obesity in African American women, because as African-American women, it is known that a greater majority is at risk. Instead the article represents a historical, cultural and psychosocial journey in attempting to understand obesity in African-American women from this perspective. The following thoughts are reflective of interactions with African-American women who have struggled with their weight and who have strived to understand the dynamics of their dilemma of being overweight and/or obese in America. This article explains that obesity in African-American women is more than an alteration in ones physiological processes. For some African-American women obesity is the essence of ones being and it has had a deleterious impact on them. Obesity in the African-American woman is not as simplistic as perceived. It is more than the management of the intake of food. Obesity is also more than the type of food that African-American women prepare and consume. Obesity in this sense maybe linked to the very essence of the women's cultural, historical and psychosocial well being. Being large can be a familial characteristic bearing no connection to the consumption and preparation of food. Important to the latter concept, and essential to the understanding of obesity in African-American women, it needs to be remembered that food may have many symbolic meanings. The symbols may be of a cultural and psychological nature and could be consciously unknown to the individual. Whatever the situation, it needs to be clear that for many African-Americans, obesity is not merely a medical problem. Being obese in America, and particularly for African-American women, has a far-reaching effect. It has reek havoc on the cultural psyche of the African-American women. The popular cultural concept conveyed by all types of media, is one of being thin and/or slim.",

      "abstract": "Die vorliegende Arbeit zeigt, dass Altern und Seneszenz ein breit gefachertes Thema ist und standig neue Erkenntnisse hinzukommen. Fast alle Lebewesen sind mehr oder weniger von Altern und Seneszenz betroffen und der Alterungsprozess wird nicht nur durch die Gene, sondern auch durch die Umwelt beeinflusst. In der Arbeit wird gepruft, ob die StudentInnen Fragen uber das Thema Altern beantworten konnen.\r\nEs stellt sich heraus, dass obwohl das Thema Altern wahrend des Studiums kaum behandelt wird, mehr oder weniger StudentInnen die Fragen richtig beantworten konnen. Werden die Fragen spezifischer, gehen die Meinungen auseinander oder die Fragen werden manchmal einfach ausgelassen. Am liebsten wurde die Frage, ob die Fortpflanzungsfahigkeit irreversibel ist (n= 24) oder die Bedeutung der Menopause (n= 14) nicht beantwortet. Auch Fragen zum mannlichen Geschlecht (Beginn der Geschlechtsreife, Fortpflanzungsfahigkeit) (n= 11) oder die Zuordnung der Werte, bei den Vergleichen verschiedener Saugetiere (bis zu 8 StudentInnen), wurden gerne ubersprungen. Die eigene Person betreffend, verschwiegen die StudentInnen bevorzugt ihr Geschlecht (n= 8) oder ihre Studienrichtung (n= 11).\r\nBei der Frage nach der Wirkung von Kosmetik-Produkten ist deutlich zu sehen, dass obwohl das Thema Altern und Kosmetik in den Medien sehr stark vertreten ist, die Wirkung nicht eindeutig ist. Sicher sind sich die meisten, dass diese den Alterungsprozess nicht stoppen konnen, aber was die Verlangsamung des Prozesses betrifft, sind sich Viele nicht sicher. Hier besteht noch ein hoher Aufklarungsbedarf.\r\nFragen, welche den Menschen betreffen, konnten meist sehr gut beantwortet werden. Bei der Fortpflanzungsfahigkeit des Mannes und der Irreversibilitat der Fortpflanzungsfahigkeit der Frau gehoren einige StudentInnen noch aufgeklart. Und auch die Definition eines potenziell unsterblichen Lebewesens konnte Klarheit schaffen.\r\nDas Ergebnis fallt somit im Grosen und Ganzen gut aus. Anhand der letzten Frage, nach dem Interesse zum Thema Altern ist zu sehen, dass ein groser Wunsch nach mehr Informationen seitens der StudentInnen vorhanden ist. Vielleicht ware es moglich das Thema mehr in das Studium zu integrieren. Nicht nur die LehramtsstudentInnen konnen viele Menschen, vor allem Kinder und Jugendliche erreichen und sie uber dieses Thema informieren. Auch die anderen StudentInnen haben die Aufgabe Menschen ohne Zugang zu diesem Wissen aufzuklaren. Das Studium konnte hierzu eine entscheidende Grundlage liefern.\r\nWie wichtig die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema Altern ist, zeigt die starke Veranderung der Bevolkerungspyramide einiger Lander. Immer mehr Menschen erreichen ein hohes Alter, wodurch das Thema Altern immer mehr an Bedeutung gewinnt. Wer kummert sich zukunftig um die alten Menschen und welche finanziellen Mittel stehen zur Verfugung? Setzen wir uns rechtzeitig mit dieser Materie auseinander, konnen wir in Zukunft besser und vernunftiger damit umgehen. Je fruher desto besser.",

The reasons for this interest include the difficulty in obtaining accurate ages for a variety of fish species, the ready availability of length and size data, the desire to more accurately reflect the sampling distributions of the data collected, and the goal of integrating various sources of data collected from a fish population. Frequently, length data are the primary information available. Furthermore, population parameters such as mortality, gear selectivity, and maturity may be better related to size rather than to age. Finally, for some populations, it might be desirable to generalize age models to accommodate multiple classifications of an individual (age, length, weight, etc.).",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "The number of adolescent pregnancies brought to term in France has continued to decline while the number of abortions remains stable. Adolescent pregnancies cannot be considered \"accidents\" either in their social or psychological aspects. Pregnant adolescents carrying to term tend to be more disadvantaged than those seeking abortions. Early pregnancy may be a response to difficult life conditions. Despite appearing to constitute an infraction of a social code, adolescent pregnancy may in fact represent an attempt at social integration through motherhood. Adolescents failing in school, with poor employment prospects and feeling family pressures may view pregnancy as a means of social recognition. But such factors by themselves do not explain pregnancy; the primordial role of psychological factors must be examined. For some adolescents, pregnancy may represent an attempt to understand their own sexual identity as the transformations of puberty unsettle their previous self-images. Or they may be failing to perceive or actively denying the possibility of pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancies may be the result of transgressions of prohibitions. The traditional prohibition of sexual activity has relaxed to the degree that it is being replaced by a new prohibition on adolescent pregnancy and a prescription to use contraception. But contraception deprives an adolescent in search of sexual identity of proof of fertility as well as of the image of spontaneity and naturalness. Use of contraception is in conflict with the questions, doubts, and anxieties of adolescence. For adolescents in a reactivated oedipal stage, heterosexuality is often at the service of incestuous fantasies involving the mother. Abortion and perhaps pregnancy itself may assume the character of a rite of passage into adulthood for some adolescents. The important thing for many is the ability to become pregnant, to be a mother like their own mother.",

Generally, body size negatively correlates with these outcomes, with larger people suffering lower self-esteem, marriage rates, and wages. However, these outcomes are unevenly distributed among racial groups, as black people counterintuitively seem robust to many of the ravages of weight discrimination. Understanding why black people do not suffer a “double burden” where weight is concerned has baffled social scientists using basic models of intersectionality to explain outcomes. The author attempts to deepen understanding of intersectionality and the structure of race in the United States by examining the combined effect of body size and skin tone or color on individual income for black Americans. The author finds that light-skinned black Americans suffer an obesity income penalty similar to white Americans, whereas medium- and dark-skinned black Americans seem to suffer no obesity income penalty.",

In general, it was found there was considerable agreement as to when a person should attain the milestones of life. There was little agreement about the correct age at which to manifest certain personality traits. This was taken to indicate that society provides its members with a set of expectations, or age norms, about when to achieve life goals. Society does not, however, seem to provide the same standards for how one should feel when achieving these goals. The greatest amount of variability of opinion for when one should manifest these personality traits was seen in the responses of the middle-aged individuals. This was taken to indicate that middle-age is a particularly ill-defined phase of life and subject to much individual interpretation as to what personal characteristics one should use to define middle-age.",

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "abstract": "The progresses of medicine, by increasing longevity, as well as in geriatrics, by improving the elderly's quality of life led to an understanding of old age based on the therapeutic metaphor. This fact, imbued with positive consequences, yet culturally reinforced by the ideology of perfect health, caused an increasing medicalization of old age, considered a disease to be cured. One of the first perceptions of the human beings' ageing process is gaining awareness of their vulnerability. Individuals start to realize that they no longer have the energy and vitality they once had and, therefore, are more vulnerable and fragile in face of biological or psychological factors tending towards the imbalance. Illness is the exact metaphor of vulnerability and suffering is the bitter face of that experience. The human being is a being destined to die. The death process is part of the life event. For life to be possible, it is necessary for death to take place continuously. During the ageing process, the human being is confronted with other dimensions that may have already been forgotten, due to the feeling of power and Independence experienced during youth and adult life. Today, being old is a problem! In the course of time, people reached naturally old age, for ageing is a part of life. But, in our days, for the first time in History, being old has become a problem. The bottom-line ethical issue is, therefore, socio-cultural. And this because, on one hand, there isn't a place for the elderly in the contemporary society as it used to happen in pre-modern social contexts, and on the other hand, the culture itself does no longer supply (as before) additional symbolic references to help them face this new step of their lives. As such, the principles of Bioethics - autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice - could pave the way towards ethical guidelines that could help third age. General Practice/Family Medicine, as a specialty based on globality and continuity of care, can and should represent an important factor of social integration of the elderly in the community, while fostering their autonomy and reducing their institutionalization in order to achieve a greater quality of life.",

Se tiene que el objetivo de este artículo fue analizar los factores biofuncionales predisponentes de depresión en adultos mayores. Se realizó una revisión desde las investigaciones y se encontró que: factores biológicos se consideran la predisposición genética heredada y la presencia de otras enfermedades; entre los factores psicológicos y sociales vivir la pérdida de algún familiar o amigo, laboral, material, de salud, de funciones físicas y/o cognitivas, vivir abandono familiar, falta de redes de apoyo, viudez, y recursos económicos insuficientes. Así que este padecimiento puede ser el resultado de la combinación de los factores antes mencionados. Si bien envejecer es una parte inevitable de la vida, la depresión no debe formar parte de ella. Los investigadores están de acuerdo en que el reconocimiento, el diagnóstico y el tratamiento tempranos pueden contrarrestar y prevenir las consecuencias emocionales y físicas de la depresión.",

      "title": "Social, cultural and ethnic determinants of obesity: from pathogenesis to treatment",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a multifactorial disease influenced by several factors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition. In recent years, the social and environmental context, along with race/ethnicity and gender, have been recognized as factors influencing obesity risk beyond traditional risk factors. This review aims to increase knowledge of these causal determinants and their implications for the treatment and management of obesity, addressing not only the individual but also the societal sphere. A growing body of evidence emphasizes the interaction between the physical and social environments in shaping personal behaviors related to obesity. Social disparities, such as socioeconomic status (income, education, employment), racial/ethnic differences, and gender, contribute significantly to weight gain from childhood to adulthood. These factors increase the risk of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors, independent of clinical and demographic variables, and may lead to stigma and discrimination against those affected. Obesity prevention solutions, from community programs to national policies, may be more effective if they address social, gender, and ethnic barriers. Understanding obesity requires a comprehensive approach that includes social, environmental, and psychological factors, as well as biological causes, to help obesity experts develop more effective interventions tailored to obesity and related diseases.",

However, the elements of social norms and religion may cause EIPD to experience sexuality differently. The approaches of health and social care institutions, the attitudes of families and caregivers, and the level of interest of the relevant occupational groups can affect the sexual well-being of the individuals. This study is a phenomenological research based on the personal experiences of EIPD. The results indicate that the participants consider themselves adequate or partiallyadequate with their knowledge on sexuality. The sexual well-being of the participants is negatively affected by aging and disability. The participants do not think they have freedom of expression and they experience discrimination from close circle. The study concludes that the sexual life of EIPD is limited or shaped by social norms, values, beliefs and religion.",

      "abstract": "When one looks at many preventive health practice norms, one might conclude that North Carolina has a unique “health care personality.” The norms in North Carolina do not quite fit with regional norms in the southeastern United States, nor do they align with those of the Mid-Atlantic states. North Carolina’s attitudes, trends, and practices related to the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding are no exception. North Carolina has a special set of issues that affect trends and practices in breastfeeding and vary across the state. Breastfeeding is sometimes referred to as the “homeless intervention.” It has no commercial home. It is neither entirely a women’s issue nor entirely a children’s issue. Breastfeeding is not a one-time thing, like an immunization or a pill; rather, it demands a 24/7 commitment on the part of new parents who have many things to learn. However, it is a mistake to think of breastfeeding as simply a lifestyle choice. In the United States, we once considered avoidance of smoking, use of a seat belt or a bike helmet, and regular exercise to be lifestyle choices with no real public health impact. However, we have been persuaded by data on health and survival, as well as by the social and health care costs of nonadherence to public health recommendations, to value these preventive health behaviors and to support them with social marketing campaigns, insurance incentives, and even laws to increase acceptance and to promote behavior change. These considerations also apply to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is a vital preventive health practice and an issue for all who care about health, whether from a clinical, business, or personal viewpoint. The support, or lack thereof, for breastfeeding has measurable implications in terms of lifelong health and wellness for North Carolinians.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Binegativity is a term used to refer to the negative stereotypes attributed to bisexual people. Examples include promiscuity, attention seeking, and/or going through a phase. Despite the success of the LGBTQ+ movement in improving social equality for gay and lesbian individuals, bisexual negative stereotypes and stigma are prevalent in both heterosexual and LGBTQ+ communities. They are problematic because they erase bisexual identities, rendering bisexual people voiceless, feeling rejected and alone in their experiences. This isolation impacts the magnitude of the social problems that this group disproportionally face. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, figures in Aotearoa New Zealand and worldwide indicate that intimate partner abuse (IPA) is more prevalent amongst bisexual women and young people in comparison to any other sexual orientation, age or gender. The limited research with bisexual women shows that bi-erasure and young age impacts women’s experiences of IPA from a male intimate partner and their help seeking behaviour. However, the mechanisms involved are not understood by society or support services, and require further research. This qualitative study aimed to address this gap by exploring the role of bisexuality and young age on the abuse and helpseeking experiences of six bisexual young women who were in an intimate relationship with a man. The transcripts of six semi-structured interviews with women were analysed. All identified as bisexual and were aged between 15 to 20 years when they first entered into an intimate relationship with their male partner. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPAN) was used to understand how the women made sense and meaning of their experiences, as interpreted by the current researcher. Four themes were identified: 1) Developing Relationship IQ; 2) Progression of Control and Abuse; 3) Unspoken Bisexuality; and 4) Help Seeking Barriers. Collectively, the themes encapsulate the unspoken nature of bisexuality and bi-erasure in society showing how it exacerbates control and abuse in IPA, and adding further barriers to helpseeking for bisexual people. Furthermore, it is clear that young people’s knowledge of IPA and available support services impacts their ability to helpseek, as does the lack of understanding of bisexuality by services and service workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest an urgent need for policy and practice to implement robust relationship education in schools and for research to further explore the role of bisexuality in IPA, drawing out bisexuality from under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted romantically and/or sexually to people of more than one sex and/or gender not necessarily at the same time not necessarily in the same way and not necessarily to the same degree” – Robyn Ochs&lt;/p&gt;",

Using the Scale of Ethnic Experience, this study revealed ethnic differences on perceived discrimination, ethnic identity, and mainstream comfort. Within the African American sample, socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender influenced these factors. However, Caucasian Americans reported less perceived discrimination and ethnic identity than did African Americans regardless of age, gender, or SES. They also perceived more control over their ability to succeed in mainstream society than did African Americans. These findings suggest that ethnicity consists of multiple components, which may be influenced by demographic factors in African Americans. It is possible that each aspect of ethnicity differentially relates to health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Summary Evolutionary theories of aging predict that fitness‐related traits, including reproductive performance, will senesce because the strength of selection declines with age. Sexual selection theory predicts, however, that male reproductive performance (especially sexual advertisement) will increase with age. In both bodies of theory, diet should mediate age‐dependent changes in reproductive performance. In this study, we show that the sexes exhibit dramatic, qualitative differences in age‐dependent reproductive performance trajectories and patterns of reproductive ageing in the cricket Teleogryllus commodus. In females, fecundity peaked early in adulthood and then declined. In contrast, male sexual advertisement increased across the natural lifespan and only declined well beyond the maximum field lifespan. These sex differences were robust to deviations from sex‐specific dietary requirements. Our results demonstrate that sexual selection can be at least as important as sex‐dependent mortality in shaping the signal of reproductive ageing.",

Moreover, to date, there are no decisive, reliable, category-defining differences between the brains of men and women.

In this paper it is argued that these differences may be explained by the gender ideology that men and women have. Literature suggests that women’s ideology internalizes the social norm of slimness and for that reason may develop eating concerns and body dissatisfaction with the pass of the time, while men externalize the value of thinness and that is why they show greater antifat attitudes than women. Data obtained from 450 male students revealed that participants high in a gender ideology scale reported greater antifat attitudes and less thinness internalization, eating concerns and body dissatisfaction. Finally, it is discussed why men and women adopt different strategies to deal with the social norm of thinness.&lt;/p&gt;",

Conservative Christian women have a more intensive view of mothering, a stronger prolife stance, a younger age of childbearing, a higher number of children and a lower education level. These trends tend to intensify for women who convert to conservative churches after the age of 16 and reduce for women who engage in wage-work. A belief in Biblical inerrancy directly reduces educational attainment as does a higher intensity of mothering, a younger age of childbearing, and higher number of children. While there is no discernible direct effect of religiosity on income level, there is an indirect effect that is important to note.",

About 42 million Americans, or about 15 percent of the population, are people with disabilities, making them arguably the largest minority group in America. About 10 percent of the population is estimated to have a hearing loss. Nevertheless, has been undertheorized-a remarkable fact for this day when smoking, eating a peach, or using a bodily orifice is hypertheorized. As a result, the general population does not understand the political connection between and the status quo the way many people now understand the connection between race and gender and contemporary structures of power. It is true that the term is not a very good one. The term abled has recently been used, but everyone, not just those paraplegics or autistics, is differently abled. Many prefer with disabilities to disabled person; the former implies a quality added to someone's personhood, whereas the latter reduces the to the disability. I use disabled person when I am talking about the object created by ableist society. These terms are all hopelessly embroiled in the politics of disability, or ability if you like, and so are basically not usable. Given that caveat, I do nevertheless use the term disability since it seems to be one that most people with use. The Deaf, however, argue that deafness is not a disability. They now see themselves as a linguistic subgroup like Latinos or Koreans. The Deaf feel that their culture, language, and community constitute a totally adequate, self-enclosed, and",

      "abstract": "The biological and social costs of body mass cannot be conceptualized in the same way. Using semiparametric methods, we show that the association between body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic outcomes such as wages, being married, and family income is distinctly shaped by gender, race, and cohort rather than being above a specific threshold of BMI. For white men, the correlation between BMI and outcomes is positive across the 'normal' range of BMI and turns negative near the cusp of the overweight range, a pattern that persists across cohorts. For white women, thinner is nearly always better, a pattern that also persists across cohorts. For black men in the 1979 cohort, the association between BMI and wages is positive across the normal and overweight ranges for wages and family income and inverted U–shaped for marriage. For black women in the 1979 cohort, thinner is better for wages and marriage. By the 1997 cohort, however, the negative association between body mass and outcomes dissipates for black Americans but not for white Americans. In the social world, 'too fat' is a subjective, contingent, and fluid judgment that differs depending on who is being judged, who does the judging, and the social domain.",

      "abstract": "This article is a review from which it seeks to formulate hypotheses that, although not empirically tested, are supported by the convergence of formulations from different sources. No study on obesity can ignore that in the USA the rates of severe and morbid obesity are comparatively much higher than in other countries. I related it to Italy whose food is equivalent to the American in calories and has a similar fast-food system. Divorce, which has a much higher rate in the USA, increases the frequency of obesity among the offspring. The American individualist culture would be at the origin of the greater number of divorces, and also of the loss of community roots. The breakdown in the feelings of family union could be the unconscious cause of an intensification of the wish to eat, since food has an implicit meaning of union, derived from breastfeeding. Further, the individual culture increases the investment in verbal communication, at the expense of non-verbal forms. Several studies highlight the factor of extroversion in obesity, which comes hand in hand with verbal investment. Other studies show a dominance factor measured by the tendency to simultaneous speech and interruptions. Severe/morbid obesity provides an abnormal reproduction, characterized by an excess of self-affirmation, of the evolutionary process that ranges from loss of intimacy in practicing grooming, in monkeys, to the appearance of verbal language, due to the increase in the number of group members.

      "abstract": "Endocrine disruptors (EDs) or simply endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to any substance which may mimic or interfere with the normal functions of the endocrine system. They are found in everyday products like plastic bottles and containers, liners of metal food cans, detergents, flame retardants, food, toys, cosmetics, pesticides, and virtually every available human consumables. Due to the fact that most of them are slow in degradation or even completely non- biodegradable, they constitute great risk to the ecosystem. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this current review therefore is to identify and peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDCs on adult male and female fertility during the critical preconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. Finally, it will highlight future research focus as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Older participants who are briefly presented with the ‘my wife and my mother-in-law’ ambiguous figure estimate its age to be higher than young participants do. This finding is thought to be the result of a subconscious social group bias that influences participants’ perception of the figure. Because people are better able to recognize similarly aged individuals, young participants are expected to perceive the ambiguous figure as a young woman, while older participants are more likely to recognize an older lady. We replicate the difference in age estimates, but find no relationship between participants’ age and their perception of the ambiguous figure. This leads us to conclude that the positive relationship between participants’ age and their age estimates of the ambiguous ‘my wife and my mother-in-law’ figure is better explained by the own-age anchor effect, which holds that people use their own age as a yard stick to determine the age of the figure, regardless of whether the young woman or the older lady is perceived. Assimilation of others’ characteristics to one’s own is particularly likely to occur in uncertain circumstances that provide little information to base judgments on, such as estimating the age of a briefly presented ambiguous figure.",

      "abstract": "During the third age, rehabilitative intervention has some particular characteristics, connected to, without any doubt, functional and biological characteristics, which are typical of this period of human life, and on the other side, connected to the common way to consider elderly people, by the elderly people themselves, by the caregivers and by the social community.\r\n\r\nToo often pain, functional limitation, reduction of autonomy and of capacity to participate in life are considered normal, almost necessary, and accepted with resignation and without any opposition.\r\n\r\nThis common idea of the elderly person is in contrast with scientific literature data, which show only the request of a longer time in more young people to reach the goals and for their reintegration, without having serious cognitive deficits or important pathologies.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, fighting to change this negative common point of view about elderly age is a challenge belonging to “rehabilitation”. Consequently it’s important to improve the capacity of the elderly person (for example in a global vision like the bio-physical-social one proposed by ICF.\r\n\r\nIn a femur fracture, a hip replacement or a osseous synthesis surgery are less meaningful if they can’t bring the patient to walk, to stand up, to sit down, to climb the stairs and take care of himself, like he did before his trauma. If the interdisciplinary work of the rehabilitation team is well done and appropriate (from the beginning soon after the trauma and the surgery), if it is constant and sufficiently protracted, it must and can warrant this result. Besides it must involve not only the elderly patient who does rehabilitation but also his family and the institutional environment that surrounds him.\r\n\r\n“Rehabilitation” has another challenge: to improve physical and functional conditions of elderly people to limit the use of drugs and surgery interventions. We are talking about interventions on osteoarthritis patients, but especially regarding intervention for the reduction of changeable risk factors of falls, which are the most frequent cause of fracture and its negative complications, including death.\r\n\r\nWe have a double strategy: one is to intervene on the elderly population in general with AFA; the other one is to intervene on high risk elderly people through a specific work.\r\n\r\nThese kinds of interventions are normally collocated in the strict cooperation between hospital or university structures and local health service structures.",

Males and females in the least acculturated group show the highest fitness levels, reflecting strenuous work patterns. Subjects from the most acculturated groups exhibit the lowest levels of fitness, a consequence of their more sedentary life‐styles. Unexpectedly, older females in these groups show exercise capacities that are equal to those of younger women. This may be a consequence of generational differences in the practice of traditional activities, such as those associated with gardening. Groups ranked intermediate in acculturation show variable patterns. For some age and sex groups, modernization has reinforced and even intensified strenuous activity patterns, resulting in high levels of fitness. For others, modernization has promoted inactivity and/or altered dietary patterns, resulting in increased body fat and low levels of fitness.",

Analisis data yang digunakan di lapangan oleh peneliti yaitu analisis data model miles dan huberman. Hasil penelitian yang ditemukan adanya faktor-faktor penyebab body shaming yaitu budaya, media massa dan jenis kelamin. Adapun dampak yang didapatkan oleh korban adalah menurunnya rasa percaya diri, mudah marah, dan cenderung menarik diri dari lingkungan.

In between is the reproductive phase or adulthood. Life span can be defined as the duration of life of an individual or organism in a particular environment. The life span of a multicellular organism may be broadly divided into three phases: development (growth), reproductive period (adulthood) and senescence (aging). The time of onset, duration and rate of each phase is dependent on the vigour and vitality of the other, and are therefore interrelated. Development normally involves both quantitative and qualitative changes leading to suitable specialization of various cells, tissues and organs of the body, which is usually referred to as differentiation. The development of many animals is divided into prenatal and postnatal periods. For many years, attention was focused on events taking place before birth, when the most striking advances occur in the animals. Prenatal and postnatal stages are characterized by certain distinguishing features, such as morphologic, physiologic, biochemical and psychological features.",

There is robust research and information regarding its biological aspects specially its endocrine base, yet the psychosocial aspect is quite interesting and debatable due to its variability among different cultures and climates. There are certain subthreshold response in form fear and loss of reproductive life to no more ability to reproduce and a feeling of loss of femininity. The period of menstruation simulated to reproductive age or fertility is around half of their lives; therefore, loss of fertility or reproductive life may be a source of stress specially among tribes where long reproductive age period is desired on the cultural belief that this will lead to a large family size that is considered as a symbol of success. Psychological factors such personal or inter-psychic (personality, self-esteem, and coping skills) and intra-psychic (relationship issues and social support) may contribute in the onset, course, and repose to perimenopausal period. There are certain psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome related to premenopausal period that must be screened.

      "abstract": "We live in a society in which messages associating physical attractiveness with success and happiness are pervasive. There is an epidemic of appearance concerns amongst teenagers and adults in westernised countries and body image dissatisfaction is now considered normative. Large numbers of people experience negative impacts on wellbeing and, for many adolescents, adults, and even children, appearance concerns are influential in choices about a range of health behaviours. The challenges facing them include difficulties with social encounters and the problem of having to cope with negative self perceptions. The Oxford Handbook of the Psychology of Appearance is a comprehensive reference text written by experts in the field. It examines how people feel about the way they look, and why it is that some people are happy with their appearance whilst increasing numbers are troubled by the way they look - reporting that these appearance-related concerns affect many aspects of their lives including relationships, health and well-being. It considers the influence of other people and how the media affects thoughts and behaviours related to appearance. It explores the experiences of people living with a disfigurement in a society that seems to be increasingly focussed on appearance and the pursuit of an idealised image of beauty, size and weight. Exploring a topic that has been often neglected in the psychological literature, this book will be invaluable for health, clinical, and social psychologists, health professionals working with patients with visible differences, and those in the field of public health and education.",

      "abstract": "Alors que la desistance peut etre definie comme la disparition des symptomes tout particulierement quand il s’agit de troubles externalises et de la delinquance habituelle qu’une personne aurait adoptee comme mode de vie, la resilience secondaire serait un rebond personnellement et socialement positif de cette personne. La non-recidive qui est le signe de la desistance ne suffit donc pas pour qu’on puisse parler de resilience car la conformite normative peut etre simplement un abandon adaptatif au meme titre que la delinquance pouvait l’etre. Meme si une delinquance violente peut etre le fruit d’un moi faible, d’une incapacite a tolerer les frustrations ou a controler les ecluses du passe, une grande part de la delinquance repose sur des mecanismes adaptatifs adequats quand bien meme ils sont moralement ou juridiquement inacceptables. Pour que la resilience secondaire se mette en place il nous semble que des mecanismes supplementaires tels que la sublimation ou un sursaut narcissique engendre un investissement d’objet hors soi. Plusieurs cas nous montrent que ces personnes sorties de la toxicomanie ou de carrieres delinquantes plus ou moins severes se sont appuyees sur un etayage narcissique externe ou sur des mecanismes de defense tournes vers la generativite pour entreprendre des actions sociales altruistes ou des activites educatives ou theâtrales qui qualifient la resilience secondaire.",

      "abstract": "Healthy aging and longevity in humans are modulated by a lucky combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. Family studies demonstrated that about 25 % of the variation in human longevity is due to genetic factors. The search for genetic and molecular basis of aging has led to the identification of genes correlated with the maintenance of the cell and of its basic metabolism as the main genetic factors affecting the individual variation of the aging phenotype. In addition, studies on calorie restriction and on the variability of genes associated with nutrient-sensing signaling, have shown that ipocaloric diet and/or a genetically efficient metabolism of nutrients, can modulate lifespan by promoting an efficient maintenance of the cell and of the organism. Recently, epigenetic studies have shown that epigenetic modifications, modulated by both genetic background and lifestyle, are very sensitive to the aging process and can either be a biomarker of the quality of aging or influence the rate and the quality of aging. On the whole, current studies are showing that interventions modulating the interaction between genetic background and environment is essential to determine the individual chance to attain longevity.",

Debido a la limitacion consecuente de la lesion, el portador de lesion medular enfrenta cambios significativos en su vida sexual. Ese estudio objetiva describir las alteraciones evidenciadas y las dificultades enfrentadas por el lesionado medular en la relacion sexual. Participaron de la investigacion diez personas portadoras de paraplejia y tetraplejia hay por lo menos seis meses, de ambos sexos. Para colecta de los datos, realizamos una entrevista estructurada. Los hallazgos apuntan que las alteraciones causadas en la funcion sexual dependen del nivel y del grado de la lesion medular. Fueron observadas alteraciones en la sensibilidad, reduccion en la misma; en la ereccion, dificultad en hacerla o mantenerla; en la evaluacion, que puede estar impedida o hacerse retrograda; en la fertilizacion, reduccion del numero de espermas; en la lubricacion, que puede estar disminuida; entre otros. La movilidad alterada es uno de los factores que mas perjudica el portador de lesion medular en el desempeno del acto sexual. Se concluye que la satisfaccion de los antojos sexuales es un factor que proporciona estado de bienestar, con eso es importante que la pareja recoja descubrir diferentes formas de satisfacer esos antojos.

Social supports and Stressors, however, particularly those embedded in daily social interactions, exhibit important forms of cultural variation not yet incorporated into stress measurements. This article reports a clinically useful measure of stress applicable to culturally diverse populations. Ninety working women with a wide range of ages, educational attainments, class backgrounds, and historical origins (Africa, northwest Europe, Hispanic, and Native Americans) provided cultural data on the meaning of stress. Consensus analysis, principal components analysis and Cronbach's alpha, and logistic regression document content validity of the stress scale items and the reliability and construct validity of the stress scale. The meaning of social supports (words or acts that imply respect, equality, or help or otherwise lead one to feel special and important) and Stressors (words or acts that demean, imply inferiority, impede achievement, or otherwise lead one to feel bad about oneself) experienced in the course of daily social interaction cuts across cultural differences in other realms of life. Informants with a recent history of stress experienced a risk of depressive symptoms 85 times higher than informants without such a history. Standardized cultural research methods yield an instrument based on potential cultural universals that can facilitate clinical assessment and management of stress and health outcomes, such as depression, in culturally diverse populations.",

It is a stage of intense physical development accompanied by substantial increases in circulating hormone levels leading to reproductive capability. Not all adolescents experience the transition to puberty at the same age, and differential pubertal timing among adolescents appears to have important implications for psychological and behavioral outcomes, making this an important area of study for integrative biopsychosocial models of development. There is also evidence that variation in pubertal timing may have different effects in boys and girls. In girls, early maturation relative to same-age peers appears to be a risk factor for many negative outcomes (Stattin & Magnusson, 1990). It is associated with increased family conflict that persists beyond the temporary perturbation in familial relations also experienced by on-time and late maturing girls.",

Most early marriages are still middle school / high school students who do not have good emotional stability and tend to do everything they want without thinking about the impact that will occur. Many of the early marriages have children, where in educating children they unconsciously apply permissive education patterns. The personal circumstances and attitudes of each child are different, making the task of educating hard to implement, and inﬂuencing the emotional state of parents. The results showed that the emotional stability of early marriages in educating children is not good, this is because early marriages are still easily inﬂuenced by negative emotions that can be seen from the emotional response shown. Excessive emotional response is not in accordance with the notion of emotional stability, namely a permanent emotional state, not easily changed, and the response shown is not excessive. In relieving negative emotions and resolving problems that occur, early marriages more often submit to the situation assuming that emotions will be lost if left unchecked, without any effort to fnd a way out or a method of solving the problem accordingly. Although early marriages do not have good emotional stability, some early marriages have been able to maintain their emotional stability by calming themselves down and solving problems that are sources of emotion.",

As the attention of narcissists is focused on themselves, they are preoccupied almost exclusively with their own thoughts, feelings, troubles and triumphs. Narcissistic, self-absorbed parents inadvertently have a devastating effect on their children because their preoccupation with themselves precludes real contact with their child. As noted, people who are vain have an inflated image of themselves that they use to compensate for feelings of inferiority, powerlessness, and self-hatred. Often people who are vain were treated as \"special\" by parents who overprotected and indulged them. As adults, they continue to expect this kind of treatment. Attitudes of superiority and a sense of entitlement are a natural outgrowth of imagining that one is extraordinary.

Anomie is a phenomenon that derives from a weakening in the power of norms, mainly caused by external factors and psychological state of mind of anomic individuals, who are characterized by a sense of uncertainty and disorientation. The decline of psychological well-being and the increase of the sense of disorientation are negatively associated to females’ likelihood of having children and also reduce the relative risk to form a union with a partner. However, these dimensions are not only the source, but also the outcome of individuals’ life course events. This paper uses matching methods to investigate how the birth of a child or union formation affects psychological well-being and disorientation. Results state that childbirth, non-marital cohabitation and marriage improve psychological well-being, while only marriage helps reducing disorientation.",

      "abstract": "Death is an inevitable phenomenon, which implies the termination of the life of persons. All over the world, in a day, a large number of children are born, but unfortunately also a large number of people die because of illness, age, homicide, suicide or poverty. Death is not only a biological process, as at the same time it affects directly the legal capacity of a person. Therefore the natural death of the person is seen as a cause that brings legal consequences at its verification. Being considered as a natural phenomenon as well as legal, death is considered as a legal fact with which legislations bind the beginnings, changes or terminations of legal. Legal capacity of a person, as a condition to undertake rights and obligations, is the determining element to gain the quality of a natural person. This quality is gained with the birth and terminated with the death. There are special cases, under which it is difficult to verify the natural death of a person for reasons such as: absence of the cadaver or the uncertainty of the circumstances in which the person has been lost or absented. In order to guarantee the legal security and also the conservation of personal and property rights of the person, legislations have provided the declaration of the person dead, which may come as a result of natural disasters, accidents, military actions or as a consequence of declaring before the person missing. This paper aims to make a comparative analysis between the procedure of declaration of a natural death of the person and the procedure of declaring a person dead according to the Albanian legislation. For this reason it will be analyzed the persons who are entitled to make the request for the declaration of the person dead, the legal force of the decision of the court through which the person is declared dead and the necessary time limits for declaring a person dead.

Being a bully victim has long-term adverse consequences on physical and mental health and financial functioning, but bullies themselves display few ill effects. Here, we show that victims suffer from greater increases in low-grade systemic inflammation from childhood to young adulthood than are seen in others. In contrast, bullies showed lower increases in inflammation into adulthood compared with those uninvolved in bullying. Elevated systemic low-grade inflammation is a mechanism by which this common childhood social adversity may get under the skin to affect adult health functioning, even many years later.",

      "title": "Baby longing and men’s reproductive motivation",
      "abstract": "Childbearing in low-fertility societies sometimes results from a strong desire to have a(nother) child. Since women tend to dominate discussions on &#x2018;baby longing&#x2019; or &#x2018;baby fever&#x2019;, it is not clear whether men also feel the powerful urge to have a child. Moreover, the demographic importance of baby longing has yet to be assessed. Using cross-sectional surveys from contemporary Finland and focusing on men, we analyse gender differences in baby longing. Both sexes report having felt an intense longing to have a child of their own at least once or a few times in their lives. A higher proportion of men say they have never longed for a child, while a higher proportion of women report having felt this longing frequently. Baby longing figures at different stages of the Traits- Desires-Intentions-Behaviour scheme of reproductive behaviour. For a small minority of men, longing first appears in youth. Baby longing among men most commonly plays into childbearing desires preceding attempts to achieve pregnancy. However, about every third man reports having first felt this longing only when trying to have a child. Baby longing among men is unrelated to economic and educational status, but it is associated with marital status, fertility intentions and the number of lifetime unions. Compared to its effects on women, baby longing among men is reported to result in having a child less often and to have less influence on childbearing decisions. We conclude that women&#x2019;s longing shapes the couple&#x2019;s fertility behaviour to a slightly higher degree than men&#x2019;s longing does, especially with regards to higher parities. Men&#x2019;s baby longing may be especially important for sustaining proceptive behaviour and preparing for fatherhood.",

      "abstract": "Object of the analysis. Investigation problem. Athletes' retirement from sports activities and their life after the end of their sports career is relevant in scientific, practical and social terms. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of scientific studies on athletes’ retirement from sport and how it relates to their life after their carrier in sports.Research methods. The analysis of scientific literature revealed that the main reasons for athletes to finish their careers in sports were trauma, health-related problems or age. Retirement can also be associated with family or family planning. Sports career termination is discussed in two ways, when one retires from sport voluntarily and when one is forced to do so. Voluntary retirement for athletes is usually a planned event and thus most often it does not have a negative impact on their future life. These athletes tend to choose a family over their sports carriers, continue their education or go to work in sports related sectors. Another important factor is athletic identity. Athletes with strong athletic identity during their sports careers tend to have better social life after their retirement. These athletes also tend to have a strong athletic identity after their careers, thus they are less likely to experience stress or depressive symptoms due to their sports career termination. Forced retirement from sports career is usually due to career-ending injuries. Such career outcome is associated with greater short-term and long-term problems in the post-sport transition period. Since athletic careers are strongly controlled by others, the unforeseen outcomes of an unexpected sports career termination results in negative consequences that are related to increased personal responsibility for their further actions. This becomes a greater problem for those athletes that have a higher level of athletic identity as it results in anxiety and depression. Therefore, forced retirement from a sports career is considered to be the most troublesome and worrying problem in the field.Outcomes and conclusions An examination of research literature focused on athlete’s retirement suggests that termination of a sports career is an important event the consequences of which depend on whether it ends by own choice or not. Since the planned retirement from the sports career is less challenging, it is important to help athletes prepare for this stage of their lives. Additionally, it is crucial to focus all efforts on creating a support system for athletes who were forced to end their athletic careers.Keywords: athletic carrier, retirement, life after sport.",

      "title": "Influence of Race, Ethnicity, and Culture on Childhood Obesity: Implications for Prevention and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Obesity may be thought of as a body weight that conveys significant risk for adverse health outcomes. In children, obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, based on population data from the 1970s (1,2). The prevalence of obesity has increased markedly in U.S. children and adolescents in the past 30 years. Obesity-related risk factors and diseases formerly seen only in adults are increasingly being recognized in obese adolescents and even younger children.\n\nRace and ethnicity are terms used to categorize populations on the basis of shared characteristics. Race has traditionally been used to categorize populations on the basis of shared biological characteristics such as genes, skin color, and other observable features. Ethnicity is used to categorize on the basis of cultural characteristics such as shared language, ancestry, religious traditions, dietary preferences, and history. Although ethnic groups can share a range of phenotypic characteristics due to their shared ancestry, the term is typically used to highlight cultural and social characteristics instead of biological ones (3).\n\nBoth race and ethnicity are, in fact, social constructs. The assumption that race reflects only biological distinctions is inaccurate. Categories based on race account for only 3–7% of total human genetic diversity, are not reliably measured, and are not always biologically meaningful (3,4). Furthermore, both race and ethnicity are constantly evolving concepts, making the task of comparing groups or following the same group over time quite challenging. For instance, the increasing proportion of the U.S. population describing their race as “mixed” or “other,” as well as changes in ethnic self-identification across generations and occasionally even within the same generation, makes it difficult to assign individuals to invariant categories of race or ethnicity. Nevertheless, the social importance given to these constructs to describe …",

      "abstract": "Discrimination is unfortunately a treatment we encounter every day in life, consciously or\r\n unconsciously. Unequal treatment, ie putting a person at a disadvantage on the basis of some\r\n of their characteristics (eg skin color or gender) is a simplified notion of discrimination.\r\n Discriminatory treatment as a phenomenon often occurs during employment and in the\r\n workplace. The law sets out the grounds on which it is prohibited to treat a certain person\r\n unequally. One of the most common forms of discrimination is gender discrimination. The\r\n Gender Equality Act protects and promotes equality between women and men in the labor\r\n market, equal opportunities in employment, working conditions and promotion. In addition to\r\n the notion of discrimination, we have recently come across the term mobbing. Mobbing is\r\n considered a type of behavior in the workplace in which an individual or group, over a long\r\n period of time, psychologically abuses another person with the aim of endangering his dignity,\r\n integrity, reputation and honor. Unfortunately, such behavior in our legal system is not yet fully\r\n defined. As a result of exerting such pressure, a person may develop mental disorders, feelings\r\n of worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and fear, etc. In addition to completely reducing work\r\n performance, it usually puts a person in a situation where he sees no way out, and for fear of\r\n losing his job. , accept manipulation as something akin to the workplace, especially if it feeds\r\n the family. In the legislation of the Republic of Croatia, there are several sources that regulate\r\n the prohibition of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and protection of dignity in\r\n the workplace, but the term mobbing is not accepted in these sources.",

Although peer and environmental factors play an important role in all drug use, family factors, psychological difficulties and emotional distress play a crucial role in the transition from controlled to excessive drug use. Essentially, dysfunctional parent – child relationships and severe family disruption contribute to emotional distress and to a sense of alienation from conventional sources of reward (family, school, work, and intimate relationships). For people who are distressed or alienated, heavy drug involvement can be a way to manage negative affect, bond with others, and/or experience alternative source of reward. Even people who use drugs to manage negative affect, however, are also likely to use them in some circumstances such as to have fun and be social. Excessive substance use also results in emotional distress, and it can be difficult to distinguish cause and consequence.",

These are the reaction and adaptation upon their marginal position in social stratification. Third, natural poverty caused by the inadequate natural condition, such as the lack natural resources or the disadvantage of geographical condition. Meanwhile, for the endogenous cause, the poverty is caused by the weakness and physical flaws (physical defect or old age), the low the human resources quality (the low of education quality, health, skill, and competence), and the weak of individual character (fatalistic, apathetic, depending, helplessness, low self-esteem, easily discouraged, uncreative and not innovative, etc.).

      "abstract": "Self-enhancement and self-protection are constrained by reality. But to what extent? Broader constraints, often considered powerful, such as East-Asian culture, religion, mind-body practices, and prison environments are not particularly effective deterrents. Narrower constraints, also considered powerful, such as self-reflection and mnemic neglect, are not very helpful either. Deliberate and systematic laboratory efforts, both at the intrapersonal level (e.g., explanatory introspection, salience of one's faults) and the interpersonal level (e.g., accountability, relationship closeness), can boast success in constraining self-enhancement and self-protection strivings, but the success is mixed, difficult to implement, and probably short-lived. The doggedness (potency and prevalence) of self-enhancement and self-protection are due to the functions or social benefits with which they are associated or confer: psychological health, goal pursuit and attainment, leadership election, and sexual selection. These functions are traceable to our species' evolutionary past.",

There are divergent opinions about this - to what extent this personality quality is valued in the modern world. Some of them define modesty as a manifestation of weakness, insecurity and indecisiveness, believing that it could be an obstacle to achieving success and realizing life goals. Others see it as a virtue and a value. In turn, academic achievement appears to be an important prerequisite for the development of a positive and stable adolescent self-image. The present study provides information on whether there is a relationship between the two variables and how they are influenced by school type, age and gender.

On the other side, sexuality can be maintained up to high age. In any case is the demand for affection, tenderness, love and sexual relations nearly always present, and its realization should not be inhibited. The sexual reactions are decreased and retarded. Therefore often a change of the role and behaviour pattern of the partners is necessary in the sexual contact. The partners should know their mutual problems and desires, show understanding and should adjust to each other. Counselling, behaviour therapy and treatment with sexual hormones can help to solve the problems.",

      "abstract": "The establishment of an optimum level of bone mineral during the years of growth, when modeling is superimposed on growth, is an important consideration in terms of lifelong skeletal integrity. Adult bone mineral status at any time in life is a function of the amount accumulated during the growing years and the amount lost during adult life. Since low bone mineral is associated with fracture risk 1 it is clear that bone mineral accrual during the growing years should be optimized, if possible. While peak bone mass is largely determined by heredity, which accounts for over 50% of the variance 2 , lifestyle patterns are also involved in a multifactorial state that is requisite for the maximization of bone mineral accrual during the growing years. Specifically, vigorous weight-bearing physical activity represents the best possibility for enhancing the attainment of an optimal level of bone mineral, within genetic limits 3 . The potential of weight-bearing physical activity to positively influence bone mineral acquisition during the growing years is a subject of increasing interest. Numerous studies have appeared in the literature over the past few years dealing with this topic. Although there has been some degree of inconsistency in the results of these studies, the available evidence suggests a significant and positive relationship between physical activity and bone mineral accrual during the growing years. Some of the inconsistent results can be attributed to limitations in study design. These include small numbers of subjects, a short duration of intervention and the difficulty in accurately assessing normal physical activity patterns in children and adolescents. But by far the greatest problem has to do with the failure to control for the wide range in maturational status for children of the same chronological age. The uneven spread in maturity status in children of the same age creates one of the most difficult challenges facing researchers studying adolescent bone growth.",

Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

Men and women did not differ significantly in terms of self-esteem, but the men described themselves as more attractive than did the women in their age group. For the 18–25-year-old white women, an intelligent, unconventional, and/or nonreligious self-concept predicts nontraditional goals and feminist attitudes, and the interaction between self-esteem and socioeconomic status influences educational goals and sex-role attitudes. For the 18–25-year-old white men, a physically strong and intelligent self-concept predicts higher educational goals and traditional career goals, and lower self-described strength and religiousness and greater intelligence predict more feminist attitudes. Physical self-concept is unrelated to goals or attitudes for the female samples. Self-concept is less strongly predictive of goals and attitudes for the black women and the older men and women. Possible reasons for the sample differences and implications for related research are discussed.",

More specifically, we examined the hypothesis that less traditional sex-role orientation is positively related to psychological well-being (other things equal) and that this relationship is stronger among the older than among younger generations. Traditional sex-role orientation was positively related to depression among older women, lending partial support to the hypothesis. Among men, however, traditional sex-role orientation was not related to well-being in the older generation but was related to both depression and life satisfaction in the younger generation. The interactive effects of marital status and retirement status with sex-role orientation were also examined but were not found to be significant.",

      "title": "Features of modern youth reproductive attitudes: expert opinions and reality",
      "abstract": "Presented is analysis of results of sociological research of reproductive attitudes of young people in modern Russian society. The article states, that they are gradually transforming from traditional to adaptive ones. Reproductive attitudes are regulated partly by common norms and values and partly by personal reproductive views. However, they are changing. In the structure of life values of modern youth, children were ranked on the 3rd place in the hierarchy of importance (after health, family). While having a child is still dominant attitude, instrumental orientation to the child is strengthened. Only 18% of young people traditionally see the joy of life in children to some extent; 47% — categorically reject traditional attitudes to childhood as a guarantee of personal and family happiness; 14% — share liberal tolerant values of individualism in their reproductive attitudes. The modern young generation is characterized by an orientation towards having few children. This is manifested in a decrease in the orientation to have two children and an increase in the orientation to have only one child, or to be childfree. From one hand, that indicates the growing value of children themselves, from other hand that shows a reduction of having children among young people. A significant degree of actual distancing of reproductive behavior attitudes from traditional values and practices in this sphere of life, their individualization and rationalization are revealed. Young people who would like to have 2 or 3 children has only one especially among younger groups when their life strategy is more orientated on study, professional self-development and achievement economical comfort life. According to youth opinion the birth of a child brings more difficulties to life than positive changes, which provokes rationalism and pragmatism of individual reproductive attitudes of the younger generation. Unwillingness to have children contributes to the growth of contraceptive culture. Although, the development of contraceptive attitudes related to the reproductive sphere is slow, that provokes the problem of abortions or “accidental” “unwanted” children. Distribution of methods of making decisions about the birth of children and their number, as well as responsibility for the onset of pregnancy have already begun to acquire the character of asymmetry, shifted towards the woman.",

In the elderly, the aging process causes physiological changes to organ systems as well as body composition. The most noticeable changes occur in the musculoskeletal system—that is, of decreased muscle strength. Handgrip strength is one of the most commonly considered criteria to measure muscle strength. Various factors, including age, gender and anthropometric measurements such as BMI, are known to affect a person’s muscle strength. In addition, weight and height affect the handgrip strength of an elderly person. However, whether BMI directly affects handgrip strength in the elderly is still debated. Several studies have stated that BMI has a relationship with handgrip strength in the elderly, while other studies have found no relationship between BMI and handgrip strength. BMI and handgrip strength is still controversial and requires further research.",

The adolescent is a marginal person who is no longer accorded the privileged status of the child, nor as yet many of the rights and responsibilities of the adult. The relatively low degree of institutionalization of adolescence as a status position and the marginal position of the adolescent in terms of role expectations in American society are reflected in the fact that most of the norms governing adolescent behavior do not have adolescent behavior patterns as their reference point. Rather, the norms and expectations governing adolescent behavior have either child or adult behavior patterns as their reference point. The exhortations of parents and other adults admonish the adolescent either to like a grown-up or to quit behaving like a child.. They rarely encourage him to like an adolescent. There are, then, no highly institutionalized expectations of how one is to behave like an adolescent, in the sense that achievement of these status expectations is a positive transitional link with the adult status.",

It is then found that these memory claims fit the life of a person who died shortly before the child was born. The accuracy of the memory claims is striking and there seems to be no possible normal explanation of this. The child also has certain character traits, interests and skills which correspond closely to those of the one who died; and, perhaps, a physical characteristic, such as a birthmark or wound, which closely resembles a characteristic of the earlier individual.",

Moreover, the mediating processes that explain these links, or protective factors that may buffer young adults from risky sexual behavior, are unknown. African American young adults who had either completed or dropped out of high school (ages 18 to 21, N = 186) provided information regarding their sexual behavior, role status, substance use, peer affiliations, religiosity, and receipt of protective family processes. Anticipated school attendance, part-time rather than full-time employment, and residence in a dorm or barracks rather than with peers or alone were negatively associated with risk behavior. Parenthood was positively associated with risk behavior; affiliation with peers who encourage risky sex partially accounted for this effect. Substance use fully accounted for the effect of part-time versus full-time employment on sexual risk behavior. Protective family processes and religiosity moderated the association of parenthood with sexual risk behavior. Prospective studies on these processes are warranted.",

With age, students perceived the problem as less serious; less often attributed it to moral weakness, but displayed little change in their endorsement of causal views emphasizing biological disease, bad environment, or normal motives; more often emphasized the individual's own responsibility for solving the problem and the value of self-initiated and nonpunitive treatment; and expressed more acceptance of the problem drinker. In addition, males were more likely than females to normalize and tolerate problem drinking. Deviance from adult-sanctioned, conventional values, although a contributor to tolerant views ofproblem drinking in its own right, could accountfor only some age and gender differences in perceptions. Implications for substance abuse education are discussed.",

It is an invisible tool primarily deployed against women and is based solely on a woman's biological identity. Discrimination in any form is fundamentally wrong, since it is based on a characteristic that is immutable (without external processes) and is reflective of stereotypical and contrived perceptions of a particular group. Sexism originates from the overemphasis of biological differences between men and women, differences based on the physiological distinctions between the male and female bodies, but more specifically, on the reproductive capacity of women. It is not merely this distinction that constitutes sexism. Rendering one sex superior to the other constructs a system that translates into definitions of gender that flow from this biological distinction. Other discriminatory practices that stem from these arbitrary notions regarding biological diversity include racism, classism, heterosexism, and ageism.",

      "title": "How pedophilic men think about adult-child sex: effects of child gender and physical maturity",
      "abstract": "To date, very little research has tackled whether pedophilic men's attitude towards adult–child sex depends on characteristics of the adult or the child involved in such acts. This study examines the effect of the child's gender (male vs. female) and physical maturity (pre-pubescent vs. early pubescent) on the moral evaluation of apparently noncoercive adult–child sex in a 2 × 2 factorial online vignette experiment. One hundred eighty-three English-speaking pedophilic men rated their agreement with moral arguments on the Immoral Sex Scale, as well as whether they believed this behavior to be typical for a child. The results revealed considerable inter-individual differences, with about one third showing restrictive moral attitudes. Contrary to our expectations, gender and physical maturity neither affected the perceived morality of the sexual act, nor beliefs about the representativeness of the child's behavior. However, when controlling for confounds, pedophilic men believed that boys were more likely to willingly engage in adult–child sex. Furthermore, participants with stronger liberal attitudes were found to be more likely to defend the sexual act, as were participants with a preferential interest in pre-pubescents. There was no link between attitudes towards adult–child sex and sexual offending, replicating the non-associations reported in previous community surveys.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This entry presents a schematic overview of the development of gender identity as a multidimensional construct and a fundamental aspect of identity construction. Gender identity encompasses an individual's biological sex (genitalia), knowledge of membership in a gender category (core gender identity), felt compatibility with one gender group (gender compatibility), felt pressure for gender conformity (gender typing and gender roles), and sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality). The salient phases, characteristics, and determinants of gender identity development and the distinctions among the different constructs are presented. Gender identity represents a psychological achievement and covers a wide spectrum of gender‐fluid characteristics, whose determinants are scientifically known to be both biological (genetic and hormonal) and social cognitive (parenting, stereotyping, gender roles). Low gender compatibility and discontent with one's own gender are some of the possible factors associated with gender identity disorders and gender variance phenomena such as transsexualism.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Given global population ageing and the fact that Australia is experiencing a significant increase in the proportion of older adults in its population, research into ageing issues has become a national priority. Whilst body image and self-esteem have been empirically linked, the relationship among older adults has been neglected. This study investigated several body-image variables and their relationship to self-esteem in a sample of 148 men and women aged 65–85 years who were living independently in the Perth Metropolitan Area of Western Australia. They completed the ‘Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale’ and the ‘Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire’. The results indicated, contrary to a common misconception, that body-image concerns are significant to self-esteem in older adulthood, but that these vary by age and gender. Whilst women appear to develop various strategies to counter the effects of ageing, men seem to be more negatively affected, particularly in relation to body functioning. The findings shed light on the meaning of body image in older adulthood. A better understanding of the meaning of body image, of the factors that influence the meaning, and of how these relate to older adults' self-esteem may help older adults develop a positive body image that will contribute to psycho-social strengths and enhance their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "After reaching old age, the elderly most often withdraw from social life. This is a serious problem because by isolating themselves from society they become less active. This has an impact on the emergence of many diseases related to both old age and the impact of physical inactivity on the body. The aim of the study was to present the consequences of the aging process in various aspects of the body’s functioning and the role of physical activity in eliminating these consequences. Unfortunately, there are still too few activities focused on physical activity for people over 65. This should change, because physical activity has a very positive effect on the human body and its well-being. Additionally, it can be observed that the earlier physical activity is started, the less changes in the body associated with the progressive aging process will occur. Such a person will be more agile and will not have major problems in dealing with overcoming the difficulties of everyday life.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing concern on early initiation of sexual activity among adolescents, increasing sexually transmitted infections, and teenage pregnancy in Uganda. Adolescents perceptions of these sexual behaviors might be the result of discussing sexual and reproductive health issues with key influencing audiences. This study qualitatively explored the effect of sexuality discussions with key influencing audiences by means of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with adolescents (N=83). Findings indicate that adolescence stage comes with changes of intense sexual desires, often presumed difficult to control thus leading adolescents to engage in sexual activities. Adolescents indicated that they were aware of the sexual behaviors such as condom use, contraception use, and multiple concurrent partnerships, but intertwined with persistent myths and misconceptions. Although discussing sexuality issues with someone was found to be instrumental, adolescent highlighted challenges that hinder discussion with key influencers. Challenges include, parents lack of time to talk to their children; some religious affiliations perceived to discourage use of contraception; limited skills of community health workers to address adolescent information needs; meetings held in groups not followed up with age-focused or one-on-one discussions; negative health workers’ attitudes and use of technical language; and peer pressure. These findings suggest the need to provide adequate and updated information to clear any misconceptions and strengthening of key influencers’ communication skills to gain confidence in addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs.",

      "abstract": "Male dog fertility disorders are usually troublesome and challenging for a practicing veterinarian.It may be generally assumed, that reproductive potential in this species is lower than in farm animals and it is still decreasing.This situation starts to be similar to human medicine, where we observe dramatic drop of reproductive capacity, which resulted in the need of implementation of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART).Situation in dogs is more complicated owing the fact, that the use of ART meets many obstacles.Low fertility potential in dogs appears to be the result of variable factors such as: specific criteria of selection for reproduction in which fertility performance in not a priority, lack of periodical obligatory fertility check, species specific predisposition for many reproductive diseases and no age limit for reproductive use of males.Dogs are kept in human environment and exposition for civilizational byproducts influences negatively not only on our health, but also on health our 'minor brothers'.It should be bear in mind, that reproductive organs are very sensitive for environmental factors disrupting homeostatic balance.The decline in male dog fertility over the past decades was proved, with potential link to environmental contaminants (4).They were found in pet foods and were also detected in the sperm and testes of adult dogs causing a detrimental effects on sperm function.Over the 26 years of the study of Lea et al. ( 4), authors found a decrease in the percentage of normal motile sperm.Between 1988 and 1998, sperm motility declined by 2.5 per cent per year.Then from 2002 to 2014 sperm motility continued to decline at a rate of 1.2% per year.In addition, the male pups had an increased incidence of cryptorchidism.Basics of physiology of reproduction of male dogs.Normally the puberty in males is associated with presence of normal sperm cells in genital organs.It is reached in male dogs at age around 5-6 months.Such a young dog obviously cannot be used for reproduction.Reproductive maturity is associated later, with development of normal sexual behavior and production of sufficient number of normal, fertilizing competent spermatozoa.It corresponds with 12-18 months of animal age.Testicular descent is completed usually before weaning period, but sometimes testicles may reach scrotum later, but never after the end of 6 month of age.That time inguinal canals start to be so narrow, that caudal passing of gonads is unlikely.Male dogs have only one accessory sexual gland -prostate, which produces vast portion of seminal plasma.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper provides an overview of the scientific evidence available on the impact of leisure directly on individual health and well-being and indirectly on health through its influence on the work, interpersonal relationship and family domains of life. The growth of time pressure, stress, and sedentary lifestyles associated with contemporary changes in work and the dominant role of technology in people's lives are contributing to unhealthy lifestyles and growing demands on health care systems. The potential contributions of leisure to health are being viewed increasingly from a public and population health perspective—a view that health is largely controllable and determined by people's actions. Increasingly, leisure is viewed to be the domain of lifestyle where people have greatest control and consequently it is seen an important resource for health. Evidence suggests that leisure viewed as discretionary behavior outside of work and other obligations can positively influence physical, psychological and spiritual health. Leisure choices and activities also can have neutral or negative impacts and displace behaviors that contribute to health and well-being. The factors that allow leisure opportunities and behavior to positively contribute to health have been the subject of growing research efforts in many western countries and increasingly in other regions of the world.",

While the term is widely employed as a bio-medical condition that is capable of being defined and measured, this chapter argues that frailty serves as a marker – a signifier – of an almost intangible loss of capabilities, autonomy and status. The frail older person is represented as the older person who is at risk. While much research has been conducted to define that risk, little has emerged that demonstrates how such risks can be reliably reduced or eliminated. Whatever else frailty means, it serves to define the frail (or ‘frailed’) older person as ontologically at risk and thereby the object of other’s discourse – in short the inescapable subject of third person accounts.",

The Environmental causal links are more difficult to control for in designs studying the kinds of stresses within the family mat may heighten the risk for the development of alcoholism. Poverty, family disorganization, antisocial behavior and alcoholism often occur together, their etiological relationship has not yet been determined. One must not, however, forget that a significant group of alcoholics does not have an alcoholic parent. An analysis of the source of the strengths of offspring of alcoholics should be as important as that of their handicap in assessing the genetic versus environmental contributions.",

      "abstract": "A minor girl’s decision about how to handle an unplanned pregnancy is a highly contested issue. Especially contentious is the minor’s ability to consent to an abortion independently of an adult such as her parents or a judge. That issue has received substantial attention from policy makers, scholars, judges, and legislators. Almost no attention has been paid, however, to the decision of a pregnant minor to continue her pregnancy, relinquish her constitutionally protected parental rights, and place a child for adoption. In 37 states, a minor’s abortion decision is regulated differently than an adult’s, while in only 15 states is a minor’s decision to relinquish parental rights and consent to adoption treated any differently from an adult’s decision. New neuroscientific advances in the understanding of minors’ decisionmaking seem to justify protective regulation of the adoption placement decisions of minor mothers, as does the law’s traditional treatment of minors’ decisionmaking in areas other than abortion. The justifications often advanced for the need for parental involvement in a minor’s abortion decision — the physical/medical risks, the psychological/emotional effects, and the importance of the decision — apply with equal force to the decision about adoption placement. The decision about adoption placement also differs from the abortion decision in at least one crucial respect — the legal complexity of the adoption decision adds another layer to the medical and moral decisions present in abortion. All states should require that minor mothers have independent legal counsel when making the decision about relinquishment of parental rights and consent to adoption placement.",

Rather than monotonous physical activities like proper exercise, women can involve themselves in more fun activities, namely, bicycling, hiking, swimming or simply playing with kids. Additionally, exercises such as aerobic or strength training for physical strengthening or yoga, meditation and tai chi for tranquility are also becoming popular among women. These activities are not only fun but also create a sense of fullness, self-love, self-satisfaction and joy in them, further combating issues like depression, anxiety and social isolation.

The reason why most of these barriers exist is because societies have until very recently not recognized that the systematic way in which they discriminate against disabled people, when backed by discriminatory laws and practices of the state, often amounts to oppression. Barnes (1991) gives a full account of the discrimination disabled people encounter in all areas of life. This oppression has developed from our history, from myths and beliefs that attribute characteristics to disabled people which are unrelated to the reality of disabled people's lives. Such collections of attitudes often determine how non-disabled people respond to the 'different' in their midst; how they form stereotypes of the disabled person as saint, sinner, superhero, freak, fiend, victim, obsessive avenger, isolationist, the butt of jokes, just a burden, or someone to be pitied. The particular form of stereotyped thinking depends on the society's history, its explanation of how it has come to be and the resultant culture.",

      "abstract": "Stature provides a means of evaluating the health and wellbeing of people during their growth period. Poor living conditions and illnesses delay growth and ultimately may produce shorter adult heights; good environmental conditions and good health may do the reverse. In bioarchaeology, skeletal heights are estimated and then compared with statures of other archaeological samples as well as those of living groups. The Point San Jose skeletal series demonstrates average stature, at least from a worldwide perspective. No substantial stature evidence for deprivation or ill health exists on that level. On the other hand, compared with nineteenth-century US military and western US prison samples, some members of Point San Jose stood shorter, at least shorter from the comparative male average. Stature estimations show that the Point San Jose skeletal heights do not represent a homogeneous military series and certainly include females. The all-inclusive Point San Jose stature estimations display a bimodal distribution. That distribution may result from small sample size, graphing distortions, ancestral differences, or sexual dimorphism.",

      "abstract": "The small number of studies on alcohol use among adults with intellectual disabilities shows their usage is significantly less than average, with very high levels of abstinence. Despite this, the literature focuses almost to exclusion on the very small number of people who do have problems, and neglects to question the possible reasons for this differential pattern of consumption. This article reviews the extant literature, showing that it constructs an inherently pathological view of drinking in people with intellectual disabilities, framing it entirely within a discourse of risk and as a personal behaviour, rather than as a social and cultural one. As a counter to this perspective, the article opens up new lines of exploration around the significance of abstinence, why it might occur to such a high degree and whether, in fact, it might itself be and also point towards the cultural exclusion of people with intellectual disabilities.",

      "title": "A comparative labour law perspective on categories of appearance-based prejudice in employment",
      "abstract": "English: Appearance discrimination entails discrimination against persons because of an\r\naspect of their appearance, such as their physical attractiveness, height, weight,\r\nmanner of dress and grooming styles. It also extends to individuals who elect to alter\r\ntheir appearance by undergoing gender reassignment.\r\nAppearance-based discrimination is a prevalent concern in workplaces across the\r\nglobe, with jurisdictions such as the United States of America, Australia, the United\r\nKingdom, Europe, Malaysia, Japan, China and South Africa showing signs of this\r\nproblem. Employers‘ subconscious appearance preferences seem to filter into their\r\nemployment decisions, policies and practices, causing employees who do not meet\r\ncertain appearance standards to suffer discrimination in employment. Employees\r\nmay also be subjected to bullying, harassment and hostile work environments\r\nbecause of their appearance characteristics.\r\nResearch indicates that individuals who are physically more attractive as well as\r\ntaller enjoy preference in the employment realm, while less attractive and shorter\r\nindividuals are discriminated against and often suffer employment detriment, even\r\nwhen these characteristics are unrelated to the inherent requirements of the job.\r\nEmployers‘ discretion to impose dress codes and grooming standards (when such\r\ncriteria are unrelated to the inherent nature of the employment position) in effect curb\r\nemployees‘ right to freedom of expression via their appearance, as well as their\r\nindividuality and personal autonomy.\r\nParticular considerations in the context of appearance-based discrimination include\r\nweight-based discrimination, discrimination against so-called ―trans-employees‖, as\r\nwell as appearance-related bullying and harassment of employees.\r\nIndividuals whose body weight deviates from the norm experience significant\r\ndiscrimination in the workplace. Overweight and obese individuals suffer particularly\r\nsevere employment detriment, as they are assumed to be in ill health, to be lazy and\r\nlacking work ethic. Employees who choose to alter their appearance through the\r\nprocess of gender reassignment are equally severely discriminated against in the employment setting. As is the position with the other categories of appearance\r\ndiscrimination, these individuals have little legal recourse that explicitly addresses\r\nthe nature of the unfair discrimination to which they are subjected. Bullying and\r\nharassment of employees because of an aspect of their appearance is another\r\nsignificant concern in employment, with the same limited legal protection currently\r\navailable to victims. As bullying is not governed or prohibited by law, and the\r\nappearance categories fall outside the ambit of the listed grounds of prohibited\r\ndiscrimination, such conduct does not officially amount to harassment either.\r\nThe global attitude towards appearance discrimination is however beginning to\r\nchange, and the International Labour Organisation has recognised this problem.\r\nVarious states in the United States of America and in Australia have started enacting\r\nlegislation to govern this issue and outlaw appearance discrimination in the\r\nemployment arena. The judiciaries of these jurisdictions, as well as those in the\r\nEuropean Union and South Africa, are also hearing more and more cases in this\r\nregard. South Africa still lags behind the rest of the world in dealing with this\r\nconcern, even though many employees in the country do suffer unfair discrimination,\r\nbullying and harassment on the basis of their appearance.\r\nDiscriminating against employees based on their appearance, without such\r\ndiscrimination being legally justifiable, amounts to unfair discrimination, and violates\r\nvictims‘ rights to equality and dignity. It also acts as a barrier to equity in the\r\nworkplace. Harassment and bullying of individuals because of an aspect of their\r\nappearance is equally unacceptable, amounting to a dignity violation.\r\n\r\nAfrikaans: Voorkomsdiskriminasie behels diskriminasie teen persone as gevolg van ‘n aspek\r\nvan hul voorkoms, onder meer fisiese aantreklikheid, lengte, gewig, klerestyl of\r\npersoonlike versorging. Dit geld ook vir individue wat kies om hul voorkoms deur\r\ngeslagswysiging te verander.\r\nVoorkomsdiskriminasie is ‘n algemene probleem in werkplekke oor die hele wereld,\r\nmet jurisdiksies soos die Verenigde State van Amerika, Australie, die Verenigde\r\nKoninkryk, Europa, Maleisie, Japan, China en Suid-Afrika wat tekens daarvan toon.\r\nWerkgewers se voorkomsvoorkeure sypel deur na hul indiensnemingsbesluite,\r\nbeleide en praktyke, en stel werknemers wat nie aan sekere voorkomsstandaarde\r\nvoldoen nie, aan diskriminasie bloot. Werknemers word ook dikwels blootgestel aan\r\nbullebakkery en teistering op grond van hul voorkoms.\r\nNavorsing dui daarop dat individue wat fisies aantrekliker en langer is, voorkeur in\r\ndie werkplek geniet, terwyl minder aantreklike en korter individue diskriminasie en\r\nbenadeling in die werksomgewing ervaar, selfs wanneer hierdie eienskappe nie met\r\ndie kernvereistes van hul werk verband hou nie.\r\nWerkgewers se diskresie om dragkodes en versorgingstandaarde neer te le (waar\r\nsulke kriteria nie met die kernvereistes van die werk verband hou nie), beperk\r\ninderwaarheid werknemers se reg op vryheid van uitdrukking via hul voorkoms, en le\r\nhul individualiteit en persoonlike outonomie aan bande.\r\nBepaalde oorwegings in verband met voorkomsgegronde diskriminasie sluit in\r\ngewigsdiskriminasie, diskriminasie teen sogenaamde ―transwerknemers‖, sowel as\r\nvoorkomsverwante bullebakkery en teistering van werknemers.\r\nIndividue wie se liggaamsgewig van die norm afwyk, ervaar beduidende\r\ndiskriminasie in die werkplek. Oorgewig en vetsugtige individue ondervind veral erge\r\nbenadeling in die werkplek omdat daar aangeneem word dat hulle siek is, lui is en\r\noor swak werksetiek beskik. Werknemers wat kies om hul voorkoms deur die proses\r\nvan geslagswysiging te verander, ervaar ewe erge diskriminasie in die werksomgewing. Soos met die ander kategoriee van voorkomsdiskriminasie, het\r\nhierdie individue weinig remedies tot hul beskikking wat die onbillike diskriminasie\r\nspesifiek hanteer. Afknouery en teistering van werknemers as gevolg van ‘n aspek\r\nvan hul voorkoms is nog ‘n beduidende bron van kommer in die werksomgewing,\r\nmet ewe min wetlike beskerming tot slagoffers se beskikking. Aangesien\r\nbullebakkery en teistering nie volgens wet gereguleer of verbied word nie, en die\r\nvoorkomskategoriee buite die bestek van die gelyste gronde van verbode\r\ndiskriminasie val, is sulke optrede ook nie (wetlik beskou) teistering nie.\r\nDie wereldwye houding teenoor voorkomsdiskriminasie is egter besig om te\r\nverander, en die Internasionale Arbeidsorganisasie het reeds die probleem erken.\r\nVerskeie state in die Verenigde State van Amerika en in Australie het begin om\r\nwetgewing uit te vaardig om hierdie probleem in die werksomgewing te reguleer en\r\nte verbied. Die howe van die jurisdiksies, sowel as die in die Europese Unie en Suid-\r\nAfrika, hoor ook al hoe meer geskille op hierdie gebied aan. Suid-Afrika is egter\r\nsteeds agter die res van die wereld in die hantering van hierdie kwessie, al gaan\r\nheelwat werknemers in die land gebuk onder onbillike diskriminasie, teistering en\r\nbullebakkery op grond van hul voorkoms.\r\nDiskriminasie teen werknemers op grond van hul voorkoms, sonder dat dit wetlik\r\ngeregverdig kan word, kom neer op onbillike diskriminasie, en skend die slagoffers\r\nse reg op gelykheid en waardigheid. Sulke diskriminasie dien ook as ‘n hindernis vir\r\ngelykheid in die werkplek. Teistering en afknouery van individue as gevolg van ‘n\r\naspek van hul voorkoms is ewe onaanvaarbaar, en kom op ‘n skending van\r\nmenswaardigheid neer.",

      "title": "Is there a link between childhood adversity, attachment style and Scotland’s excess mortality? Evidence, challenges and potential research",
      "abstract": "Scotland has a persistently high mortality rate that is not solely due to the effects of socio-economic deprivation. This \"excess\" mortality is observed across the entire country, but is greatest in and around the post-industrial conurbation of West Central Scotland. Despite systematic investigation, the causes of the excess mortality remain the subject of ongoing debate.Attachment processes are a fundamental part of human development, and have a profound influence on adult personality and behaviour, especially in response to stressors. Many studies have also shown that childhood adversity is correlated with adult morbidity and mortality. The interplay between childhood adversity and attachment is complex and not fully elucidated, but will include socio-economic, intergenerational and psychological factors. Importantly, some adverse health outcomes for parents (such as problem substance use or suicide) will simultaneously act as risk factors for their children. Data show that some forms of \"household dysfunction\" relating to childhood adversity are more prevalent in Scotland: such problems include parental problem substance use, rates of imprisonment, rates of suicide and rates of children being taken into care. However other measures of childhood or family wellbeing have not been found to be substantially different in Scotland compared to England. We suggest in this paper that the role of childhood adversity and attachment experience merits further investigation as a plausible mechanism influencing health in Scotland. A model is proposed which sets out some of the interactions between the factors of interest, and we propose parameters for the types of study which would be required to evaluate the validity of the model.",

There are a large number of studies dealing with well-being and healthy longevity; however, few of them have given us a specific formula for how to live long and healthy. Despite all the advances that have been made to create adequate physical exercise programs, sleep patterns or nutritional protocols, the relation between different types of fasting, nutritional supplementation as well as regular physical exercise and sleep patterns have not yet been satisfactorily resolved to cause the best effects of autophagy and, therefore, well-being and healthy longevity. In this way, future studies should clarify more efficiently the relationship between these variables to understand the association between regular physical exercise, sleep patterns, fasting and autophagy for healthy longevity and well-being.",

The rather negative image of the menstrual cycle which prevails is incorrect, and obscures the benefits which it offers. The empirical work which now exists provides a rigorous basis for a changed perception of the whole cycle. Throughout the cycle there is evidence of biologically-determined fluctuations in nervous system activity, which in turn are related to psychological and behavioural changes. There are now findings which clarify the relationship between these natural fluctuations in nervous system activity on the one hand and, on the other, in changes in mood, social interaction, and perception of self and of personal problems. There are in addition studies which demonstrate how the less propitious arousal levels can be changed by, for instance, moderate exercise or muscle relaxation; also how optimal advantage can be taken of those fluctuations which predispose to positive outcomes. At a time of increasing applications of empirical findings to the improvement of health and well-being, the reproductive cycle can be seen as one vehicle for improving the quality of life of many women.",

      "title": "Allergy and sports",
      "abstract": "At the beginning of the third millennium, physical exercise is often seen as a kind of panacea (a Greek word meaning \"a cure for every sickness\"): there is no doubt that it induces an increase in an individual's socialization and self-esteem, but it also has positive physiologic and psychologic effects, improving the functioning of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems, and leading to modifications in diet. Sports competitions are now an important part of economic, social, and cultural life, and leading athletes represent a model to be imitated by the majority of young people and children. Thus, a large proportion of the young population practice exercise and sports in order to achieve the best results from their bodies. Because allergic illnesses in industrialized countries affect 10–25% of the population (1), it may reasonably be hypothesized that this percentage will be the same for athletes and amateurs of various sporting disciplines. Could it be that a well-trained amateur or a professional athlete faces some problems of a pseudoallergic type when performing physical exercise? Or is it conceivable that an allergic subject can practice sports at the expert level and, indeed, become a champion? These issues will be examined in this review article. The different studies performed so far in this field are not very easily comparable owing to the different modalities of exercise (acute, prolonged, training season, etc.) or different sports (running, cycling, swimming, football, etc.) examined up to now. The methods employed to perform these studies have also been extremely varied: they range from the simple evaluation of leukocyte counts to that of the different lymphocyte subpopulations; from their response to mitogens to the study of cytokine production. Physical exercise can bring about modifications of various immunologic parameters. These studies could be an interesting point of research for that, as well as for the pathogenesis of recognized allergic disorders arising from sports. Various studies have revealed modifications in mononucleate blood cells (2–10). In general, increased levels of all the lymphocyte subclasses have been found during acute exercise, and some authors describe a fall in the CD4/CD8 ratio (11). At the end of the exercise, values fall below normal levels; according to a number of authors (2, 12, 13), both the duration and the suppression of the values depend on the intensity and duration of the exercise itself. The concentration of neutrophils increases during exercise, and continues to increase when exercise has finished (13); their oxidizing activity is reduced (14). Controversial data have been obtained on the activity of natural killer (NK) cells: they can be found to increase during exercise (15), subsequently decreasing at the end of the effort (perhaps following the prostaglandins produced by the activated monocytes [16]), or to be unchanged (17, 18), or to be reduced (19). A meta-analysis of 94 studies evaluating NK cell counts showed that there is a marked increase at the end of exercise (catecholamin-mediated demargination of cells?), whereas the cell count dropped after exercise to less than half of normal levels (20). The production of cytokines appears to increase as a response to acute exercise; proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 [21], and TNF-α) (22) are found at increased values after prolonged exercise (a 20-km run, for instance); increased IL-1β is found in the muscular tissue (23), and increased activity of IL-1 can be noted (24), although other authors (22) have found a suppression of their production 1 h after exercise. It is thought that IL-1 and TNF-α may be responsible for muscular proteolysis, since the injection of these cytokines in animals causes a release of branched chain amino acids from the skeletal muscle (25). As far as B cells are concerned, their modification during physical exercise has not yet been fully clarified; there seems to be a reduced in vitro functionality after the traditional stimuli used in the laboratory, and this is generally reversible (26). No modifications have been found in IgE and its production (27). It is worth noting the finding (28) of a marked decrease of salivary IgA levels in athletes during and after a training season. This could be a predictive marker of infectious risk for athletes (29), and also for allergic patients performing various physical activities. To explain the susceptibility of some elite athletes to infections (especially of the upper respiratory tract) during the competition season, one of the first hypotheses to be proposed is the so-called \"open window\" (5, 30, 31), meaning that between 3 and 72 h after exercise (according to the parameters being measured) there may be an increased risk of clinical events (32). This can be considered an important factor increasing, as we shall see, the risk of exercise-induced asthma. The three principal disorders which correlate allergic diseases with exercise and the practice of sport are the following: exercise-induced asthma (EIA) exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIAn) exercise-induced urticaria (EIU). EIA (the word asthma comes from the Greek word ασθμα, as Hippocrates denoted breathing with difficulty) was first described around 2000 years ago, probably by Aretaeus of Cappadocia (33, 34). Asthma has recently been defined as a \"chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract in which a number of cells have an important pathogenic role, including mastocytes, eosinophils, and the T lymphocytes. In susceptible individuals this specific inflammation provokes recurring episodes of dyspnoea, a sense of suffocation, thoracic constrictions and coughing, above all during the night and in the early hours of the morning\" (35). Generally, it is divided into \"allergic\" (or extrinsic) and \"nonallergic\" (or intrinsic) (36). The accumulation of eosinophils in the airways, the production of various proinflammatory cytokines leading to the activation of endothelial cells inducing, in turn, adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 (37), VCAM-1, selectins, and RANTES, leads to a complex inflammatory process which ends with several clinical expressions that depend both on the various stimuli and on individual responses based, for asthmatic subjects, mainly on atopy (38–45). Exercise may trigger asthma attacks. EIA represents the major risk for an allergic patient taking exercise, but, at the same time, exercise can cause serious respiratory problems also in nonasthmatic subjects. About 75–80% of asthmatic subjects out of therapy (38) may experience an asthma attack when practicing physical activity, but in recent years, even in apparently healthy, asymptomatic, and nonallergic subjects, some episodes of EIA have been described. Moreover, EIA is one of the main causes of asthma attacks in young children, often being the first symptom of atopy. The term \"exercise-induced bronchoconstriction\" (EIB) is sometimes (46) used to distinguish a physiologic response to hyperpnea, and to the drying out of the mucous membranes, from a true disease. There is a close link between EIA and sports: it is our task, by means of appropriate therapies, to allow asthmatic athletes to achieve their maximum potential; on the other hand, it has been observed that many endurance athletes, despite being asymptomatic at the beginning of their career, may develop asthma symptoms during the years of athletic activity, particularly when the activity is continued after the age of 28 (47). The symptoms are easily identifiable. They include coughing, dyspnea, thoracic constriction, and wheezing occurring several minutes after physical exertion has stopped (generally 2–10 min, peaking at around 10–15 min); they disappear spontaneously, however, after a period of time varying between 30 and 60 min (38, 48). The bronchospastic crisis (which may be slight or extremely serious, with even fatal consequences) is followed by a 2–3-h period during which renewed exertion generally does not create any kind of problem, or at most very slight symptoms. Regardless of the mechanism which gives rise to exercise-induced asthma (vascular or osmolar hypothesis) (38, 49–53), two factors are essential for EIA to be induced: the first one is the type of physical activity (exercise requiring more hyperventilation induces EIA more easily); the second one is the environment, since EIA is more frequent when the air is cold and dry. Moreover, if the bronchial reactivity is very high, a moderate ventilatory increment is sufficient to induce the symptoms; if bronchial reactivity is moderate (as, for example, in the case of a patient with pollen allergy during the interseasonal period), ventilation has to reach high levels in order to represent an adequate stimulus (54, 55). Allergic subjects are a typical example of this situation: in spring, for example, a notable increase in the number of cases of EIA has been found; this is due both to the inhalation of various pollens, and to an increase in bronchial reactivity owing to the inflammation of the airways observed during that period. The same is true for other seasons with a corresponding increase in other pollens (Ambrosia, Compositae, Parietaria, olive, and others). Individuals who show sensitivity also (or only) to perennial allergens (mites, for example) are those who, because of the chronic basic inflammation of the airways, are usually more subject to episodes of EIA. Recently, new potential hazards for allergic subjects have been described: if diving with compressed-air tanks seems to increase airway hyperresponsiveness (56–60), pollens trapped in a scuba air tank can also induce very dangerous asthma attacks underwater (61, 62). A bronchoprovocation test with physical exercise is essential. After a 5–8-min run (63) under suitable environmental conditions, the test allows the reproduction of the situations which can normally provoke an attack of EIA. By subsequently measuring the parameters of the flow-volume loop (FEV1 in partic-ular) at 5-min intervals up to 30 min, it is possible to determine whether the subject is positive for EIB (54, 55). A subject is considered positive when the FEV1 is reduced by at least 10% (in athletes) or 15% (in sedentary subjects) compared to base values. In the case of a positive outcome of the test, it is essential for the extent of the problem to be evaluated, and therapeutic safeguards put into effect for the patient under examination. EIA has been reported, for instance, in US Olympic Winter Sports athletes (64, 65), affecting about 25% of them, particularly cross-country skiers, and with a prevalence of women over men; in Finnish cross-country skiers also, the percentage was the same, with a prevalence of atopic subjects (66). The same was found for runners (67). Recently, there have been reports that the EIA screening of elite athletes shows remarkable differences between laboratory and field exercise challenges (68). In fact, exercise done during competition induces the symptoms more easily than in laboratory tests. One of the main problems currently confronting allergists is what kind of physical exercise or sport can be suggested for allergic subjects. The main questions are as follows: Can asthmatics practice sports? What kind of sport is suitable for asthmatics? How is an asthma attack to be prevented? How is an asthma attack to be treated? Of course, there is general agreement that asthmatic children not only can but should practice sports. Exercise is beneficial both for the growth and for the psychological status of asthmatic children, who often consider themselves – and are likewise considered by their parents and relatives – as seriously ill persons, incapable of achieving good performance in sports. It is often incorrectly believed by some physicians, too, that an asthmatic is not fit for sports. In fact, there is a long list of world athletes who have been able to reach the highest levels of success (taking part in world championships, the Olympic Games, and so on), despite being asthmatic; some of them have achieved quite brilliant performances. Among them, we may recall Miguel Indurain (69), the famous cyclist, and Kurt Grote (US Olympic Gold Medalist in the 400 m relay swimming in the 1996 Olympics). Another point is that there is a clear difference between power and endurance sports in terms of anaerobic and aerobic performance. It is well known that some sports involve less risk for asthmatic subjects. For instance, swimming is better than running, probably because the reduced gradient of temperature between the inhaled air and the airways decreases the effect of air on the aspecific bronchial reactivity, which is typical of the asthmatic patient. The asthmatic subject today has a whole range of measures to prevent an attack during exercise. Exercise is to be performed when the patient is clinically symptomless, but this status should also correspond to a peak respiratory flow rate (PEF) of ≥80%. The exercising individual should avoid areas and seasons where pollens are at high concentration (e.g., grass fields in springtime or indoor rooms where mites can be present). For instance, a positive skin prick test to such allergens was found in 41% of a group of Australian athletes involved in Olympic sports (70) and in 28% of 118 athletes of the Italian Olympic team (71); thus, elite athletes may often find themselves participating in competitions during already scheduled periods, which in general are not determined on the basis of the pollen season (70). Running, the highest-risk sport for asthmatics – apart from being a discipline per se, with various different events – is also a training method used in almost all sports to increase aerobic capacity. It is possible to observe subjects who do not complain of any symptom while practicing their own discipline, but who manifest symptoms during training runs. Swimming, as previously reported, is commonly suggested for asthma patients: the warm, damp air of the swimming pool avoids the drying-out and cooling of the bronchial mucous membrane which, as we have seen, is the cause of EIB, and ventilatory demands are limited. It is, however, necessary to pay attention to the high levels of chlorine as an aspecific irritant, as well as to the possible presence of mites or mold in the changing rooms and other communal areas. Medium-risk sports are team sports (particularly volleyball and basketball) in which the alternation of aerobic and anaerobic phases, as well as the relatively brief periods of continuous exercise (in any case, usually under 5–8 min), results in a lower risk of broncho-spasm; medium- to low-risk sports are those which do not require high ventilatory levels (fencing and artistic gymnastics, for example, are primarily indicated) (54), but, even in these cases, it is necessary to pay careful attention to the environmental conditions for allergy patients, or to the presence of aspecific irritants. The evaluation of the bronchial hyperreactivity is fundamental: if this proves to be high and not reversible by adequate pharmacologic therapy, even sports such as swimming are inadvisable. On the other hand, if the bronchial hyperreactivity can be prevented or reduced by treatment, even an asthmatic can practice any sport. Considerable restrictions remain, however, for any underwater activity using breathing apparatus, high-altitude sports (hang gliding or mountaineering, for example), and motor sports (54, 55). This topic is apparently not strictly related to allergy, but we will see that the relationships between viral infection, allergy, and sports are closer than they may at first appear. Infections of the respiratory tract by rhinoviruses, but also RSVs, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, influenza, and coronaviruses may exacerbate or induce an asthma attack (72), especially in young children. It has recently been demonstrated that the altered response of the airways during a viral infection probably exhibits the same mechanism as that observed during an asthma attack (73). In allergic subjects, in fact, the infiltration of the inflammatory cells, even at the level of the bronchial lumen, is supported by an increased expression of ICAM-1 (74), and 90% of human rhinovirus variants (HRVs) use this superficial glycoprotein as a receptor (75–78). If we take into consideration the fact that alterations of the immune defenses may occur for those who practice competitive sports, exposing the subject to a higher risk of viral infections, it is clear that asthmatic subjects performing exercise are at risk also from this point of view. There is general agreement that EIA can be prevented by some classes of drugs (79) (some of which are prohibited by current antidoping legislation). Salbutamol, terbutaline, and salmeterol are the only drugs allowed by antidoping laws, and they may be administered only by inhalation and only for the prevention and/or cure of EIA and EIB. The use of the drug must be reported in writing to the appropriate medical authority (80). In addition to the well-known effects of these drugs, they have the advantage of favoring the replacement of water lost during the inhalation of dry air (38). Particularly indicated for children, these drugs (cromolyn and nedocromil), with their short-term action of about 90 min, protect most athletes (even those who are prick-test negative) from EIA if administered beforehand (81). Their activity probably stabilizes the membrane of the mast cells, reducing the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators. It is well known that the systemic use of corticosteroids is reserved for the most serious cases (III and IV stage, according to GINA). In any case, they are prohibited by the antidoping laws. Conversely, the use of the topical steroids budesonide, fluticasone, flunisolide, and beclomethasone is the standard prolonged treatment of asthmatic subjects, and their use is allowed by the antidoping regulations, provided that the appropriate authorities are notified. The strategic place of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma has opened new possibilities for EIA treatment. EIA is the only key indication for the leukotriene receptor antagonists (zafirlukast and montelukast), and the drugs can also be administered in combination with β2-agonists and/or cromones. In the case of episodic exertion, β2 stimulants remain the drugs of choice for prevention and treatment, while antileukotrienes are employed when there is regular exertion, particularly in the case of children when exercise cannot be scheduled (82, 83). As far as dope testing is concerned, there are no restrictions (so far) on this class of drugs. For other classes of drugs, such as anticholinergic inhalants and orally administered theophyllines, there are no restrictions. As far as antibiotics are concerned, the only necessary caution concerns the formulation for intramuscular administration, inasmuch as local anesthetics, often used in association, are classed as doping substances. Antihistamines are prohibited only if used in association with β2 stimulants, sedatives, or ephedrine; they are in any case prohibited in the international competitions organized by the trapshooting, archery, and biathlon federations. Some antiasthmatic drugs are often used improperly even by nonasthmatic athletes in order to improve their competitive performance; in fact, some β2 stimulants (clenbuterol) (84) behave like anabolic steroids, and have been used especially by cyclists, bodybuilders, and weight lifters. Nonpharmacologic prevention, on the other hand, is based on the following strategies, which are not always easy to put into practice: Nasal breathing: this aids the warming of inhaled air, and gives rise to lower stimulation of the bronchial mucous membrane. Some authors have advocated the use of nasal dilators to reduce the airflow limitation in the nose and lungs (85, 86). At this point, it is worth remembering that allergic rhinitis, as an important factor which can predispose to or induce asthma, needs to be duly treated, mainly in children, in order to prevent EIA. The use of an anticold mask. The practice of performing warm-up exercises (87) consisting of brief exertions of between 15 and 30s, alternating with rest periods lasting 60–90s. There is, however, a certain percentage of allergic subjects with bronchial asthma able to practice either competitive or noncompetitive physical activities without any apparent problem. A relevant point to remember is that correctly administering allergen-specific immunotherapy (88) to allergic subjects can reduce bronchoreactivity, allowing them to perform better. Not being in a position to avoid pollen seasons (unless they can change hemisphere), asthma patients should avoid zones (such as grass fields) with high concentrations of allergens. A weekly pollen bulletin in many countries helps patients to assess the environmental situation. The Sydney Olympic Games, for example, were held during the southern spring, with consequently high spring pollen concentrations; a warning was announced that numerous pollen-allergic athletes taking part in competitions involving prevalently aerobic activity ran a risk of asthma (70). Another important issue is the close relationship and confidence between the patient and the doctor. There is agreement on the simple rules that have to be followed: Do not underestimate breathing difficulty after exercise, believing it to be simply the consequence of a heavier workload than normal or a normal effect of exercise. Do not underestimate episodes of dry and persistent coughing (more frequent in children after physical exercise), considering it a simple \"irritation\" of the airways. Do not underestimate excessive tiredness or headaches, accompanied by a sense of thoracic constriction and general feeling of malaise, that may arise after exercise: they may in themselves be the only manifestations of exercise-induced asthma in its initial phase. In 1996, of the 699 athletes in the American Olympic squad, 107 (15.3%) had suffered from asthma in previous years, 97 (13.9%) received antiasthma therapies, and 117 (16.7%) took antiasthma drugs or were diagnosed as having bronchial asthma. Numerous asthmatic athletes won medals in their events (89). This demonstrates that, despite preconceptions, it is possible for those with bronchial asthma to compete at the same level as non-asthmatic individuals, both in sports and in everyday life. Anaphylaxis, a name coined in 1902 by Charles Richet (1913 Nobel Prize winner) and his colleague Paul Jules Portier, to describe \"the opposite of protection (phylaxis)\" (90), is the most serious phenomenon in the field of allergology; the form arising from physical exercise is a relatively recent syndrome (first described in 1979) (91, 92). Its clinical manifestations can be extremely varied, ranging from pruritus, erythema, and urticaria to angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, laryngeal symptoms, and vascular collapse (93). There are two types of EIAn: postprandial (food-dependent, FDEIAn) non-food-dependent. In the first case, the symptoms may arise a few hours after the consumption of foodstuffs, which thus represent the predisposing factor. The literature includes cases of EIAn following the consumption of a wide variety of foods (94–96). EIAn following the consumption of snails in patients demonstrating cutaneous hypersensitivity to dust mites has also been described (97), the cross-reactivity between aeroallergens and foodstuffs being well known. Although the prognosis for this disease has not been clearly defined, a reduction in attacks has been shown in 45% of subjects upon the elimination of the foodstuff in question. In non-food-dependent EIAn, hyperemia and hyperthermia can, in subjects who have mast-cell instability, provoke an activation of the mast cells and eosinophils with massive and ubiquitous liberation of their mediators (98). Mention should also be made of the so-called aquagenic anaphylaxis (from contact with water), as well as of drug-dependent EIA (99). The diagnosis of EIAn may follow a well-defined protocol, first described by Romano et al. (100). It is important that patients with suspected food-dependent EIAn receive allergologic testing in the form of prick tests with a wide panel of commercial allergens (airborne allergens and food allergens, including seasonal foods) and fresh foods, as well as CAP System RAST. Avoidance of all test-positive foods (or of all meals, for patients whose reaction does not appear to be related to a specific food) for 4 h before exercise seems to prevent further EIAn episodes. Some authors also describe a case in which the EIAn depends mainly on the amount, and not on the type, of allergic food ingested (101). Urticaria, which has been well known since ancient times (described by Hippocrates [460–370bc]), was named by Frank in 1792 (from the Latin name for the stinging nettle Urtica urens). EIU is one of several different kinds of urticaria. These include EIU itself, physical urticaria (or urticaria factitia, or dermographism), and various forms induced by cold or heat, by compression, by exposure to solar rays, by vibrations, and by water, as well as the cholinergic form. The cold-induced form reveals itself in various ways. Among athletes, the most common is the primary acquired form; erythematous-pomphoid lesions develop in areas exposed to the cold, the wheals occurring after a few minutes and persisting for 0.5–1 h (102). Sometimes the pattern can be so serious that it might be related to EIAn, with symptoms leading to shock, especially after a swim. Delayed pressure-induced urticaria is characterized by a deep and painful pomphoid reaction which develops 3–12 h after a pressure stimulus, and which can last up to a day. In general, it affects young subjects in body areas under an increased pressure on the tissue (for example, the feet after a run, the buttocks of a cyclist, the hands of athletes who use their hands in their sports, or even in areas where a particular piece of equipment with belts, straps, or slings leads to an increase in pressure). Solar urticaria may affect all those athletes exposed to solar rays, revealing itself in erythema and wheals within 5 min of exposure to rays of a particular length, and this may vary from person to person (UVA, 320–400 nm; UVB, 290–320 nm; visible light, 400–700 nm). Aquagenic urticaria is a particular form of physical urticaria; it is provoked by simple contact of the cutis with water at body temperature. The lesions, indistinguishable from those of cholinergic urticaria, appear at 2–3 min and 30 min–1 h after contact, and regress after about 30 min (102). Other minor aspects of allergic disorders during sporting activity are related to contact dermatitis caused by different substances or situations. There have been descriptions of dermatitis in swimmers arising from phenol-formaldehyde resin and benzoyl peroxide contained in swimming goggles (103), or from diphenylthiourea or other substances in wet suits (104, 105). There are also reports of the \"sea bather eruption\" (a form of pruritic dermatitis probably due to Cnidaria larvae in Florida, the Caribbean, and Bermuda) (106, 107). Lichenoid photodermatitis in footballers (108) and dermatitis due to formaldehyde resins in athletic tape have been also described (109). The relationship between allergy and exercise has been clearly shown by a number of clinical pictures, ranging from simple dermatitis to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. The mechanisms of EIA, EIB, EIU, and EIAn have been clarified in general terms, and their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are beginning to be well defined and standardized, mainly thanks to the extraordinarily rapid growth of research in the fields of allergy and immunology. Studies concerning the effects of exercise on the immune system may also yield further data and contributions to studies on allergy and sports. Relevant points to be stressed are that during exercise other important systems are activated: the neurologic (110) and endocrine (111) systems may greatly affect immunoallergic responses, and we should be aware of this aspect when performing studies on athletes in the field and in the laboratory. Nutritional factors (112) (foods, vitamins, amino acids, and integrators) are also of great relevance; this is another sports-related field of research whose effects are generally beneficial, but its relevance to allergy is also important, as we have seen in the case of food allergy, EIAn, and EIU. The number of allergic sportsmen and sportswomen is destined to increase rapidly over the next two decades: this implies that the studies performed so far on allergy and sports, which have been briefly outlined in this review article, need to be better standardized and brought out of the laboratories into the practical field. We are now in possession of a whole range of techniques by which we can measure and individually quantify physical effort, in order to evaluate an athlete's potential, as well as to assess the level of atopy, bronchial reactivity, cell subpopulations, and mediators, all of which allows us to provide allergic subjects with appropriate counseling and correct guidelines for behavior and treatment. In short, we now have the armamentarium to allow us to help our allergic patients to realize their full athletic potential; perhaps, as doctors, some of us will some day have the satisfaction of having helped produce a champion. We thank Professors A. Balestrieri and A. Concu for suggestions and advice; Ms E. Manca, Ms B. Ambrosini, and Ms A. Ghiani for laboratory technical support; Dr M. Scorcu for collaboration in our studies on athletes; and Mr D. J. Webb for English text supervision.",

Ideas that current or past life choices could cause or contribute to infertility can cause feelings of guilt. Sexual function may be affected both by these complex feelings and by the impact of timed tests on a couple’s choices about when to have sex.

      "title": "Sharing credit / sharing blame.",
      "abstract": "In the US, adolescent pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates are declining along with the numbers of adolescents who engage in sexual intercourse before they finish high school. Contraceptive use among adolescents is also rising. The adolescent pregnancy rate remains the highest in the industrialized world, but it is finally heading in the right direction and is at its lowest level in two decades. Responsibility for this favorable turn of events is assigned to a variety of factors including greater emphasis on delaying sexual activity; increasingly conservative attitudes about casual sex and out-of-wedlock births among adolescents; fear of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV/AIDS; popularity of long-lasting contraceptive methods; more consistent or effective use of contraception; and a strong economy with better job prospects. Others credit adults, parents, teachers, and health professionals. Adolescents themselves also deserve credit and praise for adopting responsible sex behavior. While some argue that adults must continue to provide adolescents with dual messages promoting abstinence and contraceptive usage, educators should also praise adolescents. Educators should also consider accepting a portion of the blame for the persistent homophobia in the US that has led to the brutal murders of young homosexuals. Educators must not shirk from addressing this issue, and if the subject is banned from the classroom, educators must take advantage of whatever opportunities arise in their homes and communities to answer questions and respond appropriately to inappropriate jokes and slurs.",

      "abstract": "The persistent or recurrent difficulties of the woman to allow vaginal entry of a penis, a finger, and/or any object, despite the woman's expressed wish to do so\" is vaginismus. Early traumatic sexual experiences (e.g. sexual abuse), religious orthodoxy, low self-esteem and body image, negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of knowledge about sex and fear responses are some of the traditional etiological correlates of vaginismus. Vaginismus is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. An interview is crucial in differentiating the causes of this disease and it should involve the following key questions: -whether the contraction of the vaginal muscles was recorded from the first sexual contact and still remains a need for sexual satisfaction is achieved without relations vaginal or -symptom occurs for some time and what circumstances it bound or -contraction of the muscles is independent of the will, reflex and is at the very idea of sexual intercourse, and -that the contraction of the vaginal muscles occurs when you try to enter the member into the vagina which is very painful. The physical, gynecological and sexuological examinations exclude local causes of the disease. The mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases is psychosexual support. The cause of organic vaginismus is congenital malformation of the genital tract. It results from abnormal development of genital paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, which are structures involved in the process of oviduct, uterus, and vagina organogenesis. This has strong implications in the practices of gynecology and sexuology in general, not only in adolescent gynecology and sexuology. Vaginismus with congenital malformation is an important problem in these fields.",

They also lose power over their lives more informally through everyday paternalism and the structural violence, constraints, institutionalisation, and abuse they experience at hugely disproportionate rates. The assumption that because of their disability some people simply do not have the cognitive abilities to exercise choice and control over their lives, and as a result must be restricted in the name of protection, is at the root of the ableism that pervasively shapes their lives. People with disabilities have been subject to, violated, and harmed by these ableist assumptions for centuries, and they underlie the legal and social justification for restricting or obstructing their right to legal capacity and liberty.",

On the one hand, low-SES individuals tend to experience boredom frequently and more aversively. On the other hand, SES also affects how individuals respond to boredom: Those who are of low SES face both material and psychological obstacles that hinder their ability to respond to boredom constructively. Hence, the chapter demonstrates that there are compelling theoretical reasons that link boredom to poverty. Boredom is not solely an issue for the affluent or those with an abundance of leisure time. It is also a significant and pressing affective condition that afflicts individuals who face conditions of material scarcity, exploitation, or marginalization.",

      "title": "An examination of disengagement among elderly people in a low income public housing facility",
      "abstract": "Six general hypotheses guided the development of the study: The older person experiences progressive disengagement from society resulting in feelings of isolation, depression, frustration, and despair; the aging person is dissatisfied with the degree of this process of social disengagement; the aging person gains satisfaction by participating in activities which lead to individual growth and/or benefit to others; the aging person lacks capacity and/or desire to participate in many activities or to continue the full-time roles of parent, job holder, and citizen; the aging person would like to choose his activities according to his desires and needs; and the aging person will more likely participate in activities if he is able to obtain adequate health care and has financial security. Descriptive and statistical inferential tests were used to analyze the data. A relatively small percentage of possible disengagement in the recreational, occupational, and family life areas occurred during the individual's life span from age 40 to age 70. The percentage of possible disengagement in these areas increased dramatically in the life span from age 70. Most of the respondents rejected loneliness and depression and felt in good spirits most of the time. A tendency toward less and less contact with others was seen. Statistically significant differences were found between activities which were presently enjoyed which were basically individual and passive in nature; and activities respondents would plan for themselves, which were of a significantly more social nature involving them in rewarding activity with others. Statistically significant differences were found between interest in the activity program available at Northwest Tower, basically recreation and entertainment; and the activities respondents would include in their program, mainly designed for self-enhancement or benefit to others. Statistically significant differences were also found between the number of activities available and the smaller number desired. The findings suggested that the preponderance of the respondents desired to withdraw from major responsibilities outside their household. Of those who desired responsibilities such as occupation, family or civic, they were prevented from assuming them most of the time because of their increasing age, deteriorating health, and lack of money. These were also the main factors operant in restricting their activity and preventing them from enjoying satisfactory ways of living. The majority of opinions as to society's responsibility to the aging suggested that intervention was necessary to provide financial security, health care, and better and cheaper methods of transportation. The findings of the study suggested the importance of more intensive research in planning programs directly related to meeting the individual needs of elderly people.",

      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

All major population projections currently assume that fertility in the countries with the lowest levels will recover or at least not decline any further. Should birth rates, however, defy these projections and continue to decline, then these populations would shrink and age much more rapidly than currently assumed. The low fertility trap hypothesis discussed in this contribution gives plausible reasons why indeed fewer and fewer people may want to have children in the future.",

      "abstract": "The idea that people who identify as transgender or outside the gender binary are not interested in becoming parents has been refuted by several studies. However, both medical unknowns and cis-gendered normativity surround the process of becoming a parent for people identifying as transgender or outside of the gender binary, with little known about the psychosocial impact on the family formation dilemmas of transgender and gender nonconforming adults. Employing Life Course Theory as our theoretical framework, three focus group interviews were conducted with eleven adults who identified as transgender or outside the gender binary. Qualitative data analysis of the focus group interview transcripts was conducted through Thematic Analysis. Three main themes were identified concerning the dilemmas perceived by the nine participants who contemplated future parenthood: (i) Planning to become a parent -- \"but am I ready for the big responsibility?\"; (ii) who I am doesn't fit into the cis-gender system of accessing fostering, adoption or fertility services; (iii) my quest for a non-binary or gender appropriate self and the need for flexible future planning centered on reproductive capacity. Overall, thoughts about gender transition were often interwoven with parenthood plans and in a reciprocal fashion the desire and intention to have, or not have, children was implicated in satisfaction with gender transition. The significance of these themes is discussed in relation to how hopes for parenthood could be realized without jeopardizing gender identity and the need for a future focused, flexible, and open-minded approach on the part of fertility and adoption services.",

Significant gender and race/ethnic differences persist after controls for social learning variables as well as for social bonding variables. Interaction effects involving two social bonding variables—family attachment and moral belief—point to theoretically important conditions that maintain a gender gap in underage drinking and relatively low levels of deviant drinking among African American adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Psychophysical comparisons seem to show that obese individuals experience normal sweet and fat sensations, they like sweetness the same or less, but like fat more than the non-obese do. These psychophysical comparisons have been made using scales (visual analogue or category) that assume intensity labels (e.g. extremely ) which denote the same absolute perceived intensity to all. In reality, the perceived intensities denoted by labels vary because they depend on experiences with the substances to be judged. This variation makes comparisons invalid. Valid comparisons can be made by asking the subjects to rate their sensory/hedonic experiences in contexts that are not related to the specific experiences of interest. Using this methodology, we present the evidence that the sensory and hedonic properties of sweet and fat vary with body mass index. The obese live in different orosensory and orohedonic worlds than do the non-obese; the obese experience reduced sweetness, which probably intensifies fat sensations, and the obese like both sweet and fat more than the non-obese do. Genetic variation as well as taste pathology contribute to these results. These psychophysical advances will impact experimental as well as clinical studies of obesity and other eating disorders.",

      "title": "Pathological Aspects of Reproduction",
      "abstract": "fertility among certain nations has been studied in recent years by various groups of investigators. Sociologists, economists, statisticians, and biologists, even geographers, all have advanced theories to account for the stationary or declining population rates in different countries, and a literature of considerable extent has accumulated embodying their widely varying opinions. There can be no question about the important influence of social, economic, and environmental factors on the maintenance of adequate birth rates; but attention must also be accorded to certain physical causes for sterility which come within the domain of medicine and which, it seems to me, have not been given sufficient consideration in a study of the problem of a diminishing fertility. Among the causes which interfere with reproduction, there are certain well-defined processes, in which the element of disease constitutes the preponderating influence. Some of these may affect not only the individual but an entire community, and they may vary greatly both in character and in degree. Moreover, sterility, inherent or acquired, and miscarriages of normal pregnancy, as manifested in abortions and stillbirths, constitute a group of important factors in relation to population maintenance. How great an influence they exert in lowering the birth rate may be difficult to estimate; nevertheless, as many of these conditions may be prevented or cured, it is appropriate to extend to them some degree of consideration. Their existence and our attitude toward them, therefore, should prove of interest to students of population problems. Perhaps the best way to approach the subject is to take them up in order and to analyze them from a general point of view, although it may be necessary at times to resort to medical terms and descriptions.",

They focus on different aspects of the phenomenon of hunger and different levels of aggregation involved in its study. Food shortage occurs when total food supplies within a designated area—the world as a whole or continents, countries, or regions within countries—are insufficient to meet the needs of its population. Food poverty refers to the situation in which households cannot obtain enough food to meet the needs of all their members. Food deprivation refers to inadequate individual consumption of food or specific nutrients, also known as undernutrition. The relationships between food shortage, food poverty, and food deprivation are complex. If a region suffers a food shortage, some households will be food poor, and at least one household member will suffer food deprivation. Conversely, food poverty also can (and does) occur within regions where there is no aggregate food shortage, and individual food deprivation can occur in households that are not food poor. The key factor in both cases is distribution.",

      "abstract": "Summary Three- to five-year-old children (N = 134) approached each other in two experiments investigating age, sex, and dyadic sex composition differences in a social manifestation of the awareness of the sex of self and of others. Children of both sexes and at all ages both stopped and oriented their bodies farther away from opposite-sex peers than from same-sex peers, regardless of age-status or familiarity. A nonverbal technique, which is readily reproducible and experimentally manipulatable, is presented which measures an aspect of early awareness of one's own sex and that of others in an obviously meaningful interpersonal context.",

      "abstract": "Research suggests that the associations between femininity, body image and eating disorders are intricate. How these constructs are linked to each other still needs to be determined. The purpose of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of these links, examining the mediational relationship among these constructs. Also, the prediction that bulimia and binge eating disorder symptoms have a similar origin was tested and compared. Some researchers have suggested that the pathways leading to these disorders are equivalent and the main difference between the two is the dietary restriction, while others see them as distinct disorders with different etiology. A total of 355 female college students (ages 18 to 26) completed a set of questionnaires that assessed femininity, feminine gender role stress, body dissatisfaction, bulimia, and binge eating disorder. Results showed that body dissatisfaction mediates the relationship between femininity or feminine gender role stress with bulimia symptoms, as well as the relationship between feminine gender role stress and binge eating disorder symptoms. Results indicate that body dissatisfaction related to femininity or to feminine gender role stress may contribute to higher levels of bulimia symptoms. The findings also suggest that body dissatisfaction related to feminine gender role stress may contribute to higher levels of binge eating disorder symptoms. Results did not support the mediational role of body dissatisfaction between femininity and binge eating disorder. However, the mediational role of feminine gender role stress between femininity and body dissatisfaction was partially supported, suggesting that feminine gender role stress might only be one pathway by which femininity may have an impact on body dissatisfaction. iii Acknowledgements It is with all my gratitude that I would like to acknowledge and say thank you....

In this context, the study evaluates whether or not individuals continuously fulfill their religious activities on the basis of the age factor. As a result of the study, it has been determined that advance age causes individuals to feel closer to death and consequently live a more religious life by continuously fulfilling religious activities.",

      "abstract": "Food craving is often defined as a strong desire to eat. Much work has shown that it consistently and prospectively predicts eating and weight-related outcomes, contributing to the growing obesity epidemic. Although there are clear gender differences in the prevalence and health consequences of obesity, relatively little recent work has investigated gender differences in craving, or any sex-hormone-based differences as they relate to phases of the menstrual cycle. Here, we propose that gender-related differences in food craving contribute to gender-related differences in obesity. Drawing on findings in the addiction literature, we highlight ways to incorporate gender-based differences in food craving into treatment approaches, potentially improving the efficacy of obesity and weight loss treatment. Overall, this review aims to emphasize the importance of investigating gender differences in food craving, with a view towards informing the development of more effective treatments for obesity and weight loss.",

      "title": "Nutrition and Chronic Disease: Lessons from the Developing and Developed World",
      "abstract": "Many features of human susceptibility to chronic noncommunicable diseases can be mapped onto the framework of the match/mismatch hypothesis. From an evolutionary perspective, it is highly likely that the human genome has been under selective pressure to survive and reproduce against a background of seasonal food shortages and frequent episodic famines, leading to the attractive, but unproven, concept of 'a thrifty genotype made deleterious by famine'. From an ontogeny perspective, it has been clearly demonstrated that fetal undernutrition leads to a thrifty phenotype that enhances metabolic risk if the individual is later exposed to an energy-abundant environment. Data from developing and rapidly emerging countries permit insights into both of these pathways. Many populations are rapidly emerging from conditions broadly representative of human history over the past 600 or so generations (i.e. since the dawn of agriculture) and are transitioning within very few generations to a state of dietary abundance and low physical activity. And within this framework, many individuals make an even more rapid personal transition from the womb of a malnourished mother to a state of affluence. These journeys provide exceptional opportunities to interrogate thrifty genotype/phenotype theories, but such prospects are frequently impaired by a lack of robust data.",

The need for sexuality and intimacy is maintained in old age [3], only modes of sexual expression can be different concerning individual's age. In addition to physical sexual relations elderly can express sexuality through hugging, fondling, kissing, holding hands, touching or physical closeness [3, 4], through demonstrating mutual tenderness, support, and under‐ standing, and through developing a new partnership relationship [5].",

Vordergründig ist allen Jugendlichen daher bewusst, dass Selbstbefriedigung keine körperlichen Nebenwirkungen hat. Bei psychischen Auswirkungen bestehen manchmal nach wie vor Befürchtungen, dass Selbstbefriediung zu einer sexuellen Abstumpfung und Empfindungslosigkeit führen könnte. Doch selbst wenn auf körperlicher Ebene vordergründig keine negativen Auswirkungen der Selbstbefriedigung gesehen werden, sind diese Befürchtungen nicht vollkommen verschwunden. Immer dann, wenn ungewohnte oder unerwartete körperliche Wahrnehmungen auftreten, werden diese sofort mit der Befürchtung in Verbindung gebracht, sie könnten durch Selbstbefriedigung entstanden sein. Wenn während der Pubertät beispielsweise die Haut am Penis oder auf den Hoden dunkler wird oder Talgdrüsenektopien in diesem Bereich auftreten, führen diese völlig normalen Hautveränderungen zur Verunsicherung und zu der Frage, ob es möglicherweise an der Selbstbefriedigung liegen könnte.

I suggest that improved treatment of disease and handicap at all ages should be welcomed. As a secondary effect, this may in many cases result in an extension of individual lives. However, the direct aim at life extension through modification of certain basic human properties, such as genetic enhancement, should be looked at with suspicion. It may involve exaggerated risks, but the main argument is that it may diminish the existential character of what it is to be human, involving relation to others as a central aspect. To intentionally produce humans so that they become immortal is a violation against these individuals, because they lack an important existential dimension of human life. (Less)",

Hal ini pada satu sisi dapat merisaukan public pada umumnya, misalnya merisaukan lingkungan masyarakat, dunia pendidikan keluarga, sekolah bahkan pendidikan di gereja. Akan tetapi pada aspek lain terdapat orang-orang yang memiliki dorongan yang berangkat dari hati nuraninya sehingga memiliki kepedulian dan keberpihakan terhadap para remaja yang melakukan hubungan free sex. Tipikal yang demikian memiliki inisiatif sendiri untuk menolong orang-orang yang mengalami dan khususnya bagi remaja. Biasanya perihal yang dilakukan adalah berinisiasi untuk mengumpulkan mereka dan menyampaikan materi-materi yang berkaitan dengan free sex agar mengurangi lajunya pergerakan yang semakin dinamis dalam realiata yang ada.&#x0D; Pada umumnya Etika Kristen tidak membenarkan tentang hubungan seks bebas atau free sex, baik yang dilakukan oleh oknum-oknum yang berkeluarga, orang dewasa dalam hal ini yang belum menikah, ataupun oleh pemuda-pemudi bahkan remaja-remaja. Upaya Kristen dalam menangani kasus-kasus yang terjadi pada remaja tentu mengacu pada beberapa pola yang sesuai standar Alkitab. Pola-pola yang penulis maksudkan adalah upaya melalui tinjauan Alkitab tentang seksualitas, melalui pendidikan gereja, melalui pendidikan keluarga, sekolah, melalui pendekatan kontribusi terhadap budaya, masyarakat, dan melalui kontribusi terhadap pemerintah setempat. Supaya elemen-elemen tersebut saling interdepedensi dalam mengatasi free sex yang belakangan ini marak terjadi di kalangan para remaja di Indonesia. Metode yang digunakan dalam kajian jurnal ini adalah metode deskiptif dengan pendekatan literatur dan fakta data sesuai yang berkorelasi dengan judul utama dan sub-sub judul. Hasil yang ditemukan dalam kajian ini mencakup peran gereja tidak terbatas pada internal gereja melainkan berperan akif juga di luar gereja khususnya peran dalam mengantisipasi lajunya free sex yang signifikan.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a health challenge in Denmark, especially among young and middle-aged people. It raises questions about control, alienation, responsiveness, and responsibility in relation to the body in welfare societies. Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, this article explores how young and middle-aged Danes diagnosed with IBS inhabit and relate to their bodies. Previous studies have described how IBS patients experience their bodies to be unreliable, unpredictable, and embarrassing. Drawing on phenomenological explorations of bodily alterity, we argue that the gut transforms into “an other” for the afflicted. It is involved in a restless process in which it sometimes emerges as “me,” sometimes as “not-me,” and sometimes as “not-not-me.” People attempt to theorize and control their gut trouble, yet it continuously escapes their grasp. How do people live with and care for such an alienness-within? Does an IBS diagnosis make bodies feel more or less alien?",

      "abstract": "Sporting achievements are traditionally assessed in terms of the gender and age categories, based on the ideas of the fundamental differences in skeletal, physiological and hormonal characteristics of a person of certain sex and age. Modern ideas about the genetics of sex, medical advances that allow changing gender, along with active lobbying of interests of people who do not meet the binary gender norm or identify themselves with the opposite sex compared to the one of which they were born, require increased attention to the problem of gender identification in high-performance sports. In this context, there are a number of issues that require the implementation of an integrated approach by medical professionals, sports officials, and lawyers. The main one is related to the feasibility of genetic testing of athletes, which is questioned due to the lack of a statistically significant cause-and-effect relationship between abnormalities in sexual development and achieved sports results. This simultaneously raises the issue of the effect of identifying such deviations on admission to competitions, depending on sport activity, the “direction” of mutation (from man to woman or from woman to man), and the possibility of resolving the situation in a medical way. When writing the article, methods of collecting and studying isolated facts; generalization methods; scientific abstraction methods; methods of learning patterns have been used. Upon the results of the study, it is concluded that mass genetic testing is not appropriate for gender verification and that there is a need for an integrated approach to the assessment of an athlete’s sex, which cannot be limited by his/her chromosomal characteristics, which follows from the practice of international sports organizations and existing medical approaches to solving this problem.",

The extreme of weakness, as giving up and giving in, which older adults applied to others, not themselves, prompted them to engage in several efforts at staying strong. These included motivating self-talk, achieving balance, keeping busy and active, and self-validating as a strong person. Older adults' perceptions of the association between weakness and ageing were variable and characterized by considerable ambiguity.Nurses must be alert to both the visible and subtler dimensions of weakness. It is important to engage older adults in active strategies that enhance muscle strength while capitalizing on their self-motivating and validating efforts at staying strong.",

      "title": "The “no” of the Adopted Adolescent: A Combination of Factors that Encourage the Development of Oppositional Behaviours",
      "abstract": "Opposition is a common form of behaviour in adolescence, a sign of the process of self-affirmation and the quest for independence. The narcissistic foundations formed during early childhood are particularly tested at this age. They constitute a narcissistic filter protecting against invasion by the object or its deficiencies. When they are weak or deficient, opposition may take a pathological and restrictive turn, penalizing family and social inscription. This frequently occurs with adopted adolescents. The authors emphasize the reasons why the situation of adoption is liable to undermine both primary and secondary narcissistic foundations. Opposition has the effect of making imperious demands on the object while at the same time keeping it at a distance, and has more to do with taking pleasure in mastering or controlling the object than in sharing with the object. The analysis of two clinical case histories of adopted adolescents will help to highlight certain aspects of this problem. One case concerns a narcissistic confrontation owing to the mother’s alcoholism and depression in the absence of paternal regulation; the other concerns a refusal to attend school and the development of a negative identity in response to a traumatic family situation undermining the status of the adolescent’s identity. In both these situations, the “work of the negative” in Green’s sense is highlighted.",

Trata-se de uma pesquisa de revisao de literatura, que teve como foco o estudo de artigos cientificos recentes e fazer uma revisao narrativa. As mudancas corporais se tornam perceptiveis ao olhar da sociedade, e a forma como cada sujeito vivencia esse processo tende a contribuir de forma significativa para a compressao de que o idoso e assexuado, que nao se utiliza de praticas relativas ao sexo. Contudo, os idosos apresentam vida sexualmente ativa, sao propensos aos mesmos problemas de saude e merecem a mesma atencao que os mais jovens quanto a educacao sexual. Ressalta-se a importância de haver um sexo seguro, buscando a prevencao a Infeccao Sexualmente Transmissivel (IST). Conclui-se, que a sexualidade vai bem mais alem da premissa do ato sexual, e momento de troca de afeto, cumplicidade, respeito ao companheiro e amor.

People with disabilities are often placed in an intermediate status between children and adults, as if we expected them to recognise their inability to have a \"serious\" form of sexuality, marking their sexual identity. Masculinity–virility intervenes therein not in the sense of sex, as a descriptive concept, but in the sense of gender, which is an evaluative and prescriptive notion: \"being a man\" means having to show muscle power, strength, daring, or even aggressiveness. Virility places individual masculine identity within the dimension of social gender and its attributes. This issue can thus be seen to affect all men, not just physically disabled man, supposedly devoid of virility. Virility, as an attribute of one's personal identity and in its power of seduction, is not based, as some common misrepresentations would have it, on a bodily condition.",

      "title": "Adolescent Brain Development and Progressive Legal Responsibility in the Latin American Context",
      "abstract": "In this article, we analyze the contributions of neuroscience to the development of the adolescent brain and shed additional light on the minimum age of criminal responsibility in the context of Latin America. In neurobiology, maturity is perceived to be complex because the brain's temporal development process is not uniform across all its regions. This has important consequences for adolescents' behavior; in their search for the acceptance of their peers, they are more vulnerable to pressure and more sensitive to stress than adults. Their affectivity is more unstable, and they show signs of low tolerance to frustration and important emotional reactivity, with a decrease in the capacity to self-regulate. Consequently, risky behavior presents itself more frequently during adolescence, and behaviors that transgress norms and social conventions typically peak between the ages of 17 and 19. However, only a small percentage of young offenders escalate their behavior to committing crimes during adulthood. In comparative law, there are considerable differences in Latin American countries' legal dispositions regarding the minimum age of criminal responsibility; Brazil, Costa Rica, and Ecuador regard the age of criminal responsibility to be 12, while Argentina accepts this to be 16. From a legal viewpoint, however, the debate about the minimum age of criminal responsibility is connected to other circumstances that, because they are still at a developmental stage, are attributed to adolescents' rights in their decision-making and understanding of autonomy (e.g., the minimum ages for voting, alcohol consumption, and medical consent). We argue that research on the development of the adolescent brain does not provide definitive answers about the exact age required for different juridical purposes. Nonetheless, the current state of knowledge does allow for reflection on the development and maturation of adolescents and the implications for considering them criminally responsible. It also validates demands for a system that provides adolescents with greater protection and that favors their healthy integral development. In any case, although a specific minimum age is not evident, this study is disposed not to recommend lowering the age of criminal responsibility, but rather increasing it.",

Some studies indicate that greater religious involvement tends to bolster feelings of self-worth, whereas others suggest that more religious involvement is associated with less positive self-evaluations. A new perspective is tested in the present study which predicts that there may be a nonlinear U-shaped relationship between these measures. More specifically, it is proposed that self-esteem is highest among elderly people with the greatest, as well as the least, amount of religious commitment and lowest among older adults with only modest levels of religiosity. The data tend to largely support this new view. However, feelings of self-worth tend to be lowest for those with very little religious commitment rather than those with moderate levels of religious involvement.",

The principle, which we all share, is that all persons are equal and none are less equal than others. No disability, however slight, nor however severe, implies lesser moral, political or ethical status, worth or value. This is a version of the principle of equality. The three fallacies exhibited by some or all of my critics are the following: (1) Choosing to repair damage or dysfunction or to enhance function, implies either that the previous state is intolerable or that the person in that state is of lesser value or indicates that the individual in that state has a life that is not worthwhile or not thoroughly worth living. None of these implications hold. (2) Exercising choice in reproduction with the aim of producing children who will be either less damaged or diseased, or more healthy, or who will have enhanced capacities, violates the principle or equality. It does not. (3) Disability or impairment must be defined relative either to normalcy, \"normal species functioning\", or \"species typical functioning\". It is not necessarily so defined.",

These associations hold across a variety of demographic backgrounds and rival in size those linked to income and social status. Meanwhile, individuals experiencing dignity threat are much more likely to report a variety of health issues. An instrumental variable analysis provides support for the proposition that dignity leads to better health. Dignity relates to better health net of mastery, life meaning, and mattering to others. In fact, it is most strongly linked to general health when these other resources are lacking, suggesting its unique role in promoting well-being among those who are structurally or extremely disadvantaged.",

In analyzing panel data of the 'Familienentwicklung in Nordrhein-Westfalen'-study we argue that individual values are important cultural characteristics that influence young women's choices concerning motherhood. The most egalitarian category of women, who value autonomy and economic independence and who do not identify with traditional family values, has a significant lower risk of giving birth or getting pregnant than those women who do not value autonomy or who do value traditional values. A second finding in this paper is that women who are in a 'shorter' consensual union and get pregnant, more often plan their marriage before giving birth compared to women in a 'longer' consensual union. This suggests that, just. like a first child symbolizes an affirmation of marriage, a first child in 'longer' consensual unions similarly symbolizes an affirmation of continuity.",

      "title": "RACE DIFFERENCES IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF ADULT CHILDREN’S PROBLEMS ON MOTHERS’ PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING",
      "abstract": "Abstract Adult children’s problems have been found to be strong predictors of older parents’ psychological well-being, regardless of whether the sources of the problems are psychological or physical health, life circumstances outside of the children’s control, or children’s poor life decisions. Further, this pattern remains regardless of the number or proportion of offspring with problems, or whether children with problems were favored or disfavored by their parents. One important question that has not been addressed is whether the impact of children’s problems differs in Black and White families. Race disparities in health and other life circumstances lead Black adult children to be at greater risk of experiencing problems than are their White counterparts. Thus, Black mothers are at greater risk of having adult children with problems; however, increased exposure does not necessarily lead to a stronger impact of children’s problems on well-being. Alternatively, it can be argued that due to stronger kin networks and higher levels of religiosity, children’s problems may have a weaker impact on Black than White mothers’ well-being. In this paper, we use mixed-methods data collected from 101 Black mothers and 295 White mothers as part of the Within-Family Differences Study to explore differences in the impact of adult children’s problems on mothers’ depressive symptoms. Preliminary analyses of quantitative and qualitative data suggest that mothers’ interpretations of the circumstances surrounding their children’s problems, rather than support or type of problem, play a greater role in the impact of those problems on well-being in Black than White families.",

Indonesia itself is said to rank third in the world as a country with the most fatherless children. This is mostly caused by death leading to orphans, but if his absence is caused by departure from his role as a father, then the child can be said to be orphaned prematurely, a divorce, separation due to problems in the marital relationship, or problems health. This writing uses a qualitative approach with the library research method (literary study) as secondary data. The results of the study show that fatherless has many impacts on children, namely identity crises, children's sexual development, and psychological disorders in children in adulthood.",

      "title": "Relapse",
      "abstract": "Pregnancy is widely regarded as an opportunity for a drug-using woman to give up drugs and become rehabilitated into society. Drug dependence is, however, a chronically relapsing condition and progress is easily disrupted. The motivational forces need to be strong to withstand the challenges presented by a new baby. From earlier chapters we have learned that drugdependent women tend to come from deprived backgrounds in which they may have been subjected to neglect, abuse and a variety of other stressors that leave them low in self-esteem and prone to anxiety and depression. As their dependence increases they may become detached from the usual support systems of family and stable friendships. Their need for support increases when they become pregnant. The frequency of premature births and NAS among the children creates the potential for additional strain. There is evidence that babies that are premature or have feeding problems are more at risk of neglect and abuse (Browne and Saqi, 1988). A crying child can be perceived as a rejecting child, the rejection is regarded as unnatural and the mother is confirmed in her belief that she is a failure, the tensions increase and their interactions become unrewarding. This is a pattern seen in non-drug-using mothers and is linked to symptoms of anxiety and depression. It is likely that the impact on the drug-using mother is much greater. If she is also without informal support from partner, family or friends she is particularly vulnerable to self-medication at this time with her own form of therapy and may resume using the drugs that have worked for her in the past.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical and religious and spiritual factors. The multidimensional concept of sexuality is constructed socially and shaped by sexual and gender norms and inequalities. Sexuality is one of the key components of the physical, intellectual and psychosocial well-being of an individual. Patient-centered approaches are used to define 'normal' or 'healthy' sexuality. Disruption in any phase of the sexual response cycle is considered sexual dysfunction. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in mental illness is very high. The disease process by itself as well as the medication used in treatment both contribute to the increased prevalence of sexual dysfunction. The estimated prevalence of sexual dysfunction in people suffering from depression is around 70-80% in various studies. Patients suffering from Alzheimer's and related dementia have a multitude of sexual problems, which include sexual apathy, sexually inappropriate behavior, decreased sexual desire and inappropriate sexual behavior, causing disrupted marital relationships.",

      "title": "Relationships among development, growth, body size, reproduction, aging, and longevity - trade-offs and pace-of-life",
      "abstract": "Relationships of growth, metabolism, reproduction, and body size to the biological process of aging and longevity have been studied for decades and various unifying “theories of aging” have been proposed to account for the observed associations. In general, fast development, early sexual maturation leading to early reproductive effort, as well as production of many offspring, have been linked to shorter lifespans. The relationship of adult body size to longevity includes a remarkable contrast between the positive correlation in comparisons between different species and the negative correlation seen in comparisons of individuals within the same species. We now propose that longevity and presumably also the rate of aging are related to the “pace-of-life.” A slow pace-of-life including slow growth, late sexual maturation, and a small number of offspring, predicts slow aging and long life. The fast pace of life (rapid growth, early sexual maturation, and major reproductive effort) is associated with faster aging and shorter life, presumably due to underlying trade-offs. The proposed relationships between the pace-of-life and longevity apply to both inter- and intra-species comparisons as well as to dietary, genetic, and pharmacological interventions that extend life and to evidence for early life programming of the trajectory of aging. Although available evidence suggests the causality of at least some of these associations, much further work will be needed to verify this interpretation and to identify mechanisms that are responsible.",

      "abstract": "AbstractNoteworthy data is emerging to support the existence of longevity-enabling genes. Our observations of the relationship between reproductive fitness and longevity among centenarians support theories that posit strong selective forces in the determination of how fast humans age and their susceptibility to diseases associated with ageing. Current data support the idea that there is no selective advantage for humans to have a lifespan of approximately 100 years. Rather, getting to such a very old age may be a by-product of longevity-enabling genes that maximize the length of time during which women can bear children, and during which they can increase the survival probabilities of their children and grandchildren. We thus review the literature pertaining to the relationship between reproductive fitness and longevity.Es liegen bemerkenswerte Daten vor, welche die Existenz von Langlebigkeits-Genen stützen. Unsere Beobachtungen bezüglich des Verhältnisses zwischen reproduktiver Fitness und Langlebigkeit bei Hundertjährigen unterstützen die Theorien die postulieren, dass starke selektive Kräfte bezüglich der Determinierung der Geschwindigkeit, mit der Menschen altern und ihre Anfälligkeit gegenüber mit dem Alter assoziierter Krankheiten existieren. Aktuelle Daten unterstützen die Ansicht, dass es keinen selektiven Vorteil für Menschen gibt die eine Lebensdauer von ungefähr 100 Jahren haben. Eher kann das Erreichen eines so hohen Alters eine Nebenerscheinung von Genen sein, die Langlebigkeit ermöglichen. Diese maximieren die Dauer, während der Frauen Kinder gebären können und während der sie die Überlebenswahrscheinlichkeit ihrer Kinder und Enkelkinder erhöhen können. Wir geben daher einen Literaturüberblick das Verhältnis zwischen reproduktiver Fitness und Langlebigkeit betreffend.Des données sérieuses créditant l'existence de gènes de la longévité commencent à apparaître. Nos observations concernant la relation entre aptitude reproductive et longévité chez les centenaires, appuient les théories qui postulent que des forces sélectives puissantes opèrent sur la détermination du rythme de vieillissement et de la susceptibilité aux maladies qui lui sont associées. Les données actuelles sont favorables à l'idée qu'il n'y a pas d'avantage sélectif pour les humains à vivre approximativement 100 ans. Par contre, atteindre un âge aussi élevé peut être un à côté des gènes de longévité qui rendent maximum le temps pendant lequel les femmes peuvent avoir des enfants et pendant lequel elles peuvent accroître les probabilités de survie de leurs enfants et de leurs petits enfants. Dans cette perspective, nous passons en revue la littérature concernant les rapports entre aptitude reproductive et longévité.",

This includes: the management of the anatomy, physiology and sexual behaviourof the young boar, that influences its performance as an adult. Normal reproductive activity in boars is coordinated by the endocrine and nervous system. Abnormal activity in one or more of these areas can result in reproductive problems. For the development of the sexual behaviour is important to considerer plays and social conditions of rearing of penmates. Play in animals is common in mammals, frequent in young and is not oriented to satisfy the immediate needs and carries appreciable costs in energy, time and even physical risk. Although, play contributes to the development of several functions that take place in the adult. Sexual behavior begin as early as 1 month of age in boars; mounting activity of penmates is observed more frequently for males than females. Some authors emphasized the importance of social conditions during rearing, due to the sexual activity showed in pubertal boars.",

Consequently, it is often difficult to believe that religion or a particular manner of religious awareness can also be conducive to the degradation and humiliation of individuals, and that it can be maneuvered to justify abusive behavior. In this article we discuss the emotional repercussions of religious-related abuse in the family, an aspect that is rarely documented in the field of psychotherapy, but has many negative consequences. Religious-oriented emotional abuse is traceable to several levels of human functioning: the individual's internal level of experiencing themselves, the interpersonal and systemic levels, where the individual enters relationships, as well as within the framework of the individual's relationship with God.",

More than has been recognized so far, eating is a continuous form of body work that is decidedly essential to aesthetic labour. Against the backdrop of slender aesthetics, models are purposefully socialized into remaining or becoming slender, through food beliefs inducing them to eat in specific ways. Food is classified into good and bad categories, and believed to affect male and female bodies differently. But other than to aesthetics or gender, considering ‘what (not) to eat’ links to morality, enabling models to draw symbolic boundaries between themselves and others. These show two main moral imperatives: models should eat controlled and effortlessly. Solving this moral paradox, models normalize and conceal controlled eating. Ultimately, the fashion modelling food system preoccupies models with self-surveillance and reinforces power inequalities between models and other professionals.",

Specifically, we examined whether traditional gender-role endorsement, belief in male sexuality stereotypes, and age predict sexual compliance among heterosexual men. Participants (N = 426 men) completed a brief demographic questionnaire, measures of gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes, as well as a modified measure investigating motives for consenting to unwanted kissing, sexual touching, oral sex, and/or penetrative sex. The reported incidence rate of mild sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to unwanted kissing at least once) in heterosexual men was 61.3% over the past 12 months. Results suggest that sexual compliance in heterosexual men may be predicted by their endorsement of traditional gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes. Moreover, men may be motivated to be sexually compliant due to motives of altruism, intoxication, sexual inexperience, peer pressure, popularity, and sex-role concerns.",

In particular, this article focuses on gender differences in weight-based teasing and in the ways boys and girls responded to being teased within the high school context. Findings suggest that girls’ body fat was more closely monitored and criticized than boys’ by both male and female peers. Boys and girls of all sizes and all social groups, including teens who were overweight, were critical of people who displayed body fat. This article argues that by engaging in “othering” discourses of their peers’ body fat, adolescents, regardless of their size, were able to discursively construct themselves as “normal” in comparison. In doing so, they negotiated a higher social rank for themselves and distanced themselves from the reality of everyday fatness.",

      "title": "The Promise of Intersectional Stigma to Understand the Complexities of Adolescent Pregnancy and Motherhood",
      "abstract": "For decades, adolescent pregnancy prevention strategies focused on proximal determinants. These strategies resulted in impressive declines in US adolescent pregnancy and birth rates, reaching historic lows in 2014. However, disparities in adolescent birth rates by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status persist. Further, not only are adolescents of color and those who live in underserved communities more likely to become pregnant, they are also more likely than their white and more affluent peers to experience negative health and social consequences of pregnancy and parenthood. More distal or “upstream” factors, such as social stigma, may cause these persistent disparities. This paper aims to build upon a nascent framework, intersectional stigma, and show how it may shape efforts to address the needs of adolescent mothers. Stigma is defined as a deeply discrediting attribute that marginalizes groups of people as “other.” Intersectional stigma posits that individuals may experience stigma resulting from the dynamic interaction of multiple marginalized social identities. Adolescent pregnancy and motherhood often cross multiple oppressed identities (e.g., minority race/ethnicity, single motherhood, low socioeconomic status), resulting in intersectional stigma. This stigma is experienced at school, in healthcare and social services, through media, and in public. As a result, adolescent mothers describe experiencing shame, guilt, and unhealthy coping strategies including avoiding the locations and institutions involved in their experience of stigma. Doing so can lead to repeat births and delinquent behaviors. The intersectional stigma framework provides a guide to the development of interventions to reduce stigma and improve outcomes for pregnant and parenting adolescents.",

In addition, sterilization sometimes has been performed with the mistaken belief that it will prevent expressions of sexuality, diminish the chances of sexual exploitation, or reduce the likelihood of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. A decision to pursue sterilization of someone with developmental disabilities requires a careful assessment of the individual's capacity to make decisions, the consequences of reproduction for the person and any child that might be born, the alternative means available to address the consequences of sexual maturation, and the applicable local, state, and federal laws. Pediatricians can facilitate good decision-making by raising these issues at the onset of puberty.",

Feeding one's child is also a very powerful maternal and paternal drive. For all these reasons, problems with childhood nutrition and hydration are often found to be very distressing problems in children's palliative care, particularly for parents. This seems to be an area that tends to be overlooked in the African children's palliative care setting, perhaps because malnutrition is so common in children with AIDS and/or cancer in Africa. This chapter notes that malnutrition is a social problem with medical consequences: people must address the social issues that caused it, or it will simply return. Management of terminal loss of appetite and thirst is guided largely by what the child wants: if he is thirsty or hungry, then drink and food should be given. If not, the situation is less clear.",

      "title": "A Socio- Religious Perspective of Late Marriage and Stigmatization of Single Adults and its Impact on the Church in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "Late marriage among adult youths is one of the challenges in the church in Nigeria. It affects the image of the church and the spiritual growth of the people concerned. Many of the youths marry at late thirties to late forties.Late marriage here refers to situations when aperson who hasreach the state of maturity in every facet of life that is; mentally, spiritually, financially and physically is not married probably as a result of unavailability of spouse or some other factors. Although there are a few who deliberately choose to delay their marriage probably because of academic, career or ministerial pursuit but majority of those who are having late marriage are not prepared for it. They have their life planned out only to find it difficult to settle into blissful home.Many of those with delay marriage are being mocked by their relatives and peers; many times they are seen as people with peculiar problem. The church also treated them sometime as people who have spiritual problem or are not spiritual enough to pray through and get answer in the area of marriage. Sometimes their case is termed demonic and they are stigmatized. This attitude discouraged many adult singles, particularly the females, and made them feel not welcome in the Church. The loneliness and the temptation the matured singles face in their various offices are beyond imagination: the harassment of bosses, insult from colleagues and ungodly proposals from ridiculous quarters coupled with fellow Christians teasing them that ‘how is bro?’ when it is obvious that the fellow is not into any relationship is like putting salt in a sore. The paper attempts to examine the causes of late marriage, the socio-religious perspective of marriage among the Yoruba, stigmatization of female single adults and the impact of these on the Church, using the descriptive and socio-historical approach. Findings showed that many go into marriage to satisfy social and religious expectations not necessarily because it was the best thing for them as at the time they married. It becomes necessary to re-orientate the youths on the need to make necessary preparations before marriage and see marriage as a gift from God. Most important is the fact that late marriage or no marriage at all does not make one less human or less intelligent.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual selection drives the evolution of some of the most exaggerated traits in nature. Studies on sexual selection often focus on the size of these traits relative to body size, but few focus on energetic maintenance costs of the tissues that compose them, and the ways in which these costs vary with body size. The relationships between energy use and body size have consequences that may allow large individuals to invest disproportionally more in sexually selected structures, or lead to the reduced per‐gram maintenance cost of enlarged structures. Although sexually selected traits can incur energetic maintenance costs, these costs are not universally high; they are dependent on the relative mass and metabolic activity of tissues associated with them. Energetic costs of maintenance may play a pervasive yet little‐explored role in shaping the relative scaling of sexually selected traits across diverse taxa.

      "abstract": "A large and consistent body of epidemiological evidence indicates that there is an inverse relationship between physical activity and risk of mortality. Higher levels of physical activity at all intensities are associated with lower mortality risk but, minute-for-minute, higher intensities are associated with greater benefit. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that participation in muscle-strengthening exercise, as well as aerobic physical activity, is associated with lower risk of mortality. High levels of sedentary behaviour are associated with higher mortality risk, but this relationship is complex, with a stronger relationship observed for television viewing than overall sitting, and it appears that the risk associated with high levels of sitting can be mitigated by high levels of physical activity. The biological traits cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength are also both inversely associated with risk of mortality. The available evidence suggests that those with the highest levels of physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness have approximately 1.5 to 4 years longer life expectancy than those with the lowest levels of activity/fitness. It is important to note that while the evidence base is large and convincing, the observational nature of these data preclude firm conclusions being made about the causal nature of these relationships without other supporting data. However, there are many plausible biological mechanisms to explain the associations between physical activity (and related factors) and risk of mortality which provide strong evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship. This evidence is described in later chapters.",

      "title": "On the epidemiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
      "abstract": "Abstract The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is high in Chinese in South East China and in those living in a traditional Chinese manner in the countries of South East Asia. The related Mongoloid peoples of Japan and Korea have a low incidence, as do the Caucasians of Europe, America and India. In Chinese born abroad and living in a “Western”‐type environment in Australia, Hawaii and California the incidence falls significantly. This suggests that the high incidence in the Chinese relates to a genetically determined racial or “line” predisposition combined with environmental factors or to environmental factors alone. In Kenya, ethnic origin does not relate to incidence which depends on environmental factors only. The possible significance of genetic factors cannot be assessed until adequate information on the genetic profiles of racial groups with high and low incidences is available. Different environmental factors may be of importance. Biologic agents such as fungi or viruses may be of importance in some areas, in others a physical or chemical agent may be of significance, or the cancer may arise following exposure to a combination of factors. In some areas inhalation of polynuclear hydrocarbons may be of importance, in others the ingestion of nitrosamine‐like compounds, and these external agents may only be effective if combined with a viral infection, possibly the Epstein‐Barr virus or with a particular nutritional or hormonal status. The local tissue sensitivity is the factor which determines the response to any particular external agent. Examination of the external environment is, perhaps, of less importance than that of the milieu intérieur, as it is now recognized that the stability of the respiratory epithelium is affected by hormonal and nutritional factors. Universally the incidence in men is higher than in women, and this may relate to their different internal environments.",

      "title": "Terrorism and Poverty",
      "abstract": "Terrorism and poverty have multiple definitions. Terrorism is the premeditated use or threat to use violence by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political or social goal through the intimidation of a large audience. Poverty is lacking sufficient material possessions or income to satisfy a person’s needs. Terrorism and poverty are multifaceted magnitudes. Terrorism can be domestic or transnational and rooted in ethnic, religious, economic, or political factors. Extreme poverty corresponds to a situation where the individual’s basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter are not met. More generally, poverty refers to failure to achieve these living standards along with education, health, and other necessities. Poverty is strongly and negatively associated with income. Both terrorism and poverty are related through social, economic, and political elements, making their association complex. Despite the intrinsic difficulty in appraising the relationship between terrorism and poverty, their connection is intriguing. This article compiles bibliographic references to empirical research related to two questions: Does terrorism cause poverty? Does poverty cause terrorism? There is a consensus on the answer to the first question: Terrorism has a negative impact on the economy, thus making individuals poorer. Hence, the research focuses on how to measure such negative impact and to assess its magnitude in various dimensions. However, the causal link from poverty to terrorism is not as easy to establish as intuition might suggest. Economic conditions do play a role in explaining terrorism outcomes, but their effect is mediated through other determinants making the causal relation from poverty to terrorism, if existing, much more complex. This article is organized as follows: After a section summarizing the general overviews of the field of terrorism studies in general and the Political Economy of Terrorism in particular, two sections organize the annotated bibliography regarding first the causal connection from terrorism to poverty and then from poverty to terrorism. The multiple economic consequences of terrorism are referred to in various subsections devoted to the aggregate economic cost of terrorism and its impact on investment, market valuation of firms, and the tourism sector. The role of poverty in causing terrorism is then analyzed including Aggregate Studies, some Explanations, and an analysis of the Policy Response to terrorism.",

      "abstract": "Postmenopausal longevity may have evolved in our lineage when ancestral grandmothers subsidized their daughters' fertility by provisioning grandchildren, but the verbal hypothesis has lacked mathematical support until now. Here, we present a formal simulation in which life spans similar to those of modern chimpanzees lengthen into the modern human range as a consequence of grandmother effects. Greater longevity raises the chance of living through the fertile years but is opposed by costs that differ for the sexes. Our grandmother assumptions are restrictive. Only females who are no longer fertile themselves are eligible, and female fertility extends to age 45 years. Initially, there are very few eligible grandmothers and effects are small. Grandmothers can support only one dependent at a time and do not care selectively for their daughters' offspring. They must take the oldest juveniles still relying on mothers; and infants under the age of 2 years are never eligible for subsidy. Our model includes no assumptions about brains, learning or pair bonds. Grandmother effects alone are sufficient to propel the doubling of life spans in less than sixty thousand years.",

Study participants were 77 men and 75 women aged between 18 and 38 years. Individuals in romantic relationships had lower cortisol levels than singles. Individuals of African ethnicity, however, showed the opposite pattern. Individuals who perceived their relationship to be highly unstable had higher cortisol levels. Aside from African-Americans, married individuals reported the lowest relationship instability and the lowest cortisol levels, followed by individuals in long-term relationships, and by individuals in short-term relationships. The presence or absence of clear dominance in the relationship, dominance status, or relationship worries did not affect cortisol levels. Therefore relationship status and relationship instability were better predictors of variation in cortisol (presumably through stress-related mechanisms) than individual attributes.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is a medical condition marked by a diminished capacity to halt or manage alcohol consumption, even in the face of detrimental social, professional, or health outcomes. It encompasses various terms such as alcohol abuse, dependence, addiction, and colloquially, alcoholism. Research has consistently highlighted the significant toll that alcoholism can take on the spouses of individuals struggling with alcohol addiction. Living with a spouse who struggles with alcoholism can be incredibly challenging and emotionally taxing. It can have significant impacts on one's mental and physical health, as well as on the dynamics of the relationship and family life. The typologies of wives of alcoholics categorize the various coping and behavioral patterns these individuals may adopt in response to their spouse's alcoholism, including enabling the behavior, adopting a victim mindset, compensating by being overly competent (the hero), displaying oppositional behavior (the rebel), or withdrawing emotionally and socially to protect themselves. The dynamics of alcoholism in a marriage can erode trust, communication, and intimacy, often leading to a breakdown of the relationship if left unaddressed. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or support groups, can be crucial for both spouses to navigate the challenges of alcoholism and work towards healing and recovery, either individually or as a couple.",

Erectile disorder, as withother sexual dysfunctions, may be caused by, or associated with a number of diseases that impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, men who have few physical problems may also experience the disorder due to psychological factors. Men who suffer from ED due to psychogenic factors are believed to differ from functional men in five key cognitive and behavioral domains. Barlow and Sbrocco (1996) used these differences to formulate a model of male sexual dysfunction that explicitly addresses the cognitive mechanisms involved in ED. The model proposes that a key point in the development of ED is whether or not a man feels challenged or threatened when experiencing a discrepancy between expected and actual performance. Men who are challenged by the experience typically have the skills necessary to identify and alleviate the discrepancy in performance. They are believed to use positive outcome expectancy and confidence to overcome suboptimal sexual performance and maintain function. In contrast, men who are threatened by discrepancies between expected and actual performance may expect a negative outcome and have little faith in their ability to sexually perform.",

      "abstract": "El futbol a edades tempranas, como otros ambitos de la sociedad, se estructura en grupos de 1 ano de edad cronologica, buscando crear una practica y competicion mas justa e igualitaria entre los participantes. Sin embargo, este clasico sistema de agrupacion de jugadores a edades tempranas presenta algunos efectos negativos a la hora de identificar y seleccionar a jovenes jugadores con talento. Las diferencias en la edad cronologica entre jugadores que han nacido en un mismo ano (conocido como edad relativa) asi como las diferencias en la maduracion biologica de estos jugadores son dos de los principales factores que, junto con las expectativas de eficacia de los entrenadores acerca de las habilidades de sus jugadores, estan influyendo en la seleccion y el desarrollo de los jovenes jugadores de futbol. A pesar de que la edad cronologica entre jugadores de un mismo equipo difiere en menos de un ano, las diferencias biologicas entre ellos, debido a un estado madurativo distinto, puede suponer una ventaja antropometrica y de rendimiento fisico para aquellos jugadores mas avanzados en su maduracion biologica. Estas ventajas producidas por un estado madurativo distinto son temporales y pueden crear un sesgo en el proceso de identificacion y seleccion de talentos, a la vez que hace del actual sistema de agrupacion de jugadores, basado en la edad cronologica, un sistema poco justo e igualitario. Los objetivos de la presente tesis doctoral fueron (1) informar acerca de la posible existencia de un sesgo en el proceso de identificacion y seleccion de talentos en futbol que favorece a los jugadores nacidos en los primeros meses del ano, asi como de la relacion de este efecto con las medidas antropometricas y de rendimiento fisico; (2) evaluar las posibles diferencias en las medidas antropometricas y de rendimiento fisico, asi como en las adaptaciones al entrenamiento de fuerza, entre jugadores con diferente estado madurativo y (3) analizar las diferencias en las expectativas de eficacia del entrenador acerca de jugadores con distinto estado madurativo. Un ultimo objetivo de esta tesis fue proponer un modelo teorico para agrupar a los jugadores de un club de futbol basado en el estado madurativo y el rendimiento fisico de los jugadores, asi como en las expectativas de eficacia del entrenador. Los principales hallazgos de esta tesis incluyen: (1) un solido sesgo en la participacion en futbol que favorece a aquellos jugadores nacidos antes durante el ano de seleccion; (2) que el estado madurativo de los jovenes jugadores de futbol afecta a su rendimiento fisico mientras que el cuartil de nacimiento no discrimina entre aquellos jugadores con mejor o peor rendimiento en los test fisicos; (3) que los entrenadores no perciben las ventajas en el rendimiento fisico de los jugadores con un estado madurativo mas avanzado; (4) que los jugadores con un estado madurativo mas avanzado tienen mejores valores antropometricos y de rendimiento fisico que los jugadores con un estado madurativo menos avanzado y (5) que los jugadores con un estado madurativo distinto tienen distintas adaptaciones para programas de entrenamiento de la fuerza concretos. Los resultados obtenidos en esta tesis indican que el estado madurativo de los jovenes jugadores de futbol debe ser evaluado y controlado para un mejor proceso de identificacion y seleccion de talentos, asi como para mejorar los programas de desarrollo a largo plazo del deportista. Estos hallazgos pueden permitir que los entrenadores y profesionales del futbol comprendan mejor los sesgos que influyen en la participacion de este deporte y en el proceso de seleccion de jugadores, pudiendo incluso ayudar a los clubes de futbol a crear grupos o equipos mas homogeneos que tengan en cuenta el estado madurativo y que permitan una practica del futbol en igualdad de condiciones en futbol a edades tempranas.",

      "title": "S09 * GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ALCOHOLISM I",
      "abstract": "# S09.1 FEMALE ALCOHOLISM, CLINICAL DIFFERENCES AND DIFFERENCES IN THERAPY {#article-title-2}\n\nAlcohol abuse and alcoholism are among the major medical problems afflicting both men and women. While men display a higher prevalence for alcoholism, it is women who suffer a much greater risk for alcoholism-associated bodily damage. Although women generally consume less alcohol compared to men, females usually suffer more severe brain and other organ damage following binge or chronic alcohol abuse. Aim of this work was to search for clinical differences between male and female alcoholism. Main methods and key findings are: although many biological (i.e., genetic risk and neurological abnormalities) and psychosocial (i.e., impact of positive drinking expectancies, personality characteristics and deviance proneness) factors appear to impact men and women equally. These factors especially social and environmental, physiological, genetic and neurobiological ones have been demonstrated to contribute to the sex difference in response to alcohol intake, as well as the development of alcoholic complications. A number of neurotransmitters and growth factors may be partially involved in these differences between men and women. The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in the development of addictive behaviors. Differences in dopamine receptor density are found between sexes where gonadal steroid hormones may play a role. Differences in some gene polymorphisms were found in subgroups of patients due to Lesch typology (particularly MAOA) with respect to gender. Females were mainly type II and III alcoholics regarding Lesch typology of alcoholism; therefore they need different treatment.\n\n# S09.2 GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED BRAIN ATROPHY {#article-title-3}\n\nBackground. Alcohol dependence is unequally distributed across gender (1/3 women versus 2/3 men), though the percentage of women with alcohol dependence seems to be growing. Little is known whether alcohol affects men and women differently.\n\nMethods. A first step to assess gender-related differences of alcohol dependence is to compare structural differences as well as neurocognitive function in alcohol-dependent women and men.\n\nResults. Though women start to develop an alcohol disorder later in life (Escribano & Parra, 2007), they move more rapidly from abuse to dependence (Walter, 2003) and suffer from the same detrimental effects of alcohol on cognitive, neurologic and internal function as men (Nixon et al., 1995).\n\nOn a structural level, several studies have reported gender differences in alcohol-related brain atrophy. Mann et al. (1992) found an enlarged size of the ventricles in alcohol-dependent women compared to alcohol dependent men. Other groups found a more pronounced loss of hippocampus volume in women (Agartz et al., 1999), or gender-associated size of the corpus callosum (Hommer et al., 1996). However, another study only found differences of brain volume when comparing alcohol dependent men to healthy controls (Pfefferbaum et al., 2001).\n\nConclusions. Future studies will have to assess whether there are functional correlates of these structural differences between men and women, using e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or connectivity analyses. One could address the question why women progress much faster from abuse to dependence, or whether there are profound gender differences in response to alcohol stimuli or suffering a relapse.\n\n# S09.3 GENDER RISK IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT SETS OF GENES {#article-title-4}\n\nIntroduction and Aim. Results from non-marker genetic studies, like twin studies, indicate that the genetic influence on alcohol dependence risk is different in women and men. The aim of this analysis of a large, multi-centre case-control study in alcohol-dependent individuals is to investigate several gene variants in alcohol-dependent women and men separately.\n\nPatients and Methods. more than 2000 alcohol-dependent individuals (530 females) from three addiction treatment centres and over 2000 controls (1026 females) were included. Characteristics of AD and related phenotypes were obtained using standardized structured interviews. All subjects were genotyped for several candidate gene variants, including the GABA, Glutamate, Serotonin and Dopamine system.\n\nResults. While in the total sample, ADH4, GABAergic, Dopaminergic and Serotonergic gene variants were associated with alcohol dependence; males and females had a different set of gene variants influencing alcohol-dependence.\n\nConclusions. This study confirms that different sets of genes influence alcohol dependence risk in males and females and may provide evidence for gender-specific treatment strategies.\n\n# S09.4 DIFFERENCES IN SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AMONG MALE AND FEMALE ALCOHOLICS {#article-title-5}\n\nBackground. The lifetime risk of a suicide attempt in alcohol-dependent individuals is high, estimated for 7-15%. Similarly to general population, the risk of suicidal death has been shown to be significantly higher in males, while prevalence of suicide attempts – in female alcoholics. However, other differences in suicidal behavior among male and female alcoholics have not been satisfactory studied. Material and methods: In two outpatient and two residential alcohol treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland, 113 patients who reported a suicide attempt during their lifetime were interviewed. The data concerning demographics, severity of suicide attempts, course of alcohol dependence and psychopathology with special interest to impulsivity was collected. The groups of male and female alcoholics were compared.\n\nResults. Among alcohol dependent patients with a history of at least one suicide attempt, men were significantly more impulsive than women in stop signal task (p = 0.02). Men appeared to have more severe course of alcohol dependence, with higher scores in Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (p < 0.00005) and Short Inventory of Problems (p = 0.036). No differences in social support (p = 0.31), general psychopathology (p = 0.43), or education (p = 0.37) were found. Those patients whose most serious attempt was during a heavy drinking episode were more likely to be males (82.3% vs 47.1%). In addition, violent suicide attempts were significantly more frequent in men than in women (p = 0.0005).\n\nConclusions. Suicide attempts in male alcoholics were more violent and more dangerous than in female alcoholics, which may be related to higher impulsivity and to intoxicating effects of alcohol.",

Stability occurs as life trajectories following an adolescent pregnancy are often consistent with trajectories prior to the pregnancy. However, adolescent pregnancy also has the potential to transform the lives of young women and young men. Psychological and physical changes may be multidirectional, with the direction of change depending on individual characteristics and the context of the pregnancy. Prenatal care, reactions of others, and legislation all have the potential to impact the degree to which pregnancy‐related changes are mostly positive or mostly negative. Research goals include increased focus on the dynamic interaction between early life trajectories and transformation changes associated with adolescent pregnancy.",

Such concerns did not originate from recent technological advances but from the ancient Greeks and Romans who honored health more than life, and the early Christians who honored life more than health. These opposing concepts reflect differing notions of quality of life. Determining the quality of life involves personal issues--the cognitive ability to evaluate one's own life; the perception of a satisfactory state of social, emotional, physical, and mental health; and an acceptable feeling of well-being despite physical limitations. In contrast, and often conflict, are objective evaluations of treatment outcomes, morbidity/mortality statistics, cost/benefit analyses, and age studies performed in an attempt to determine quality of life by persons other than the patient.",

      "abstract": "Until recently, most 40-year-old women considered their families complete and wanted no more children. At present, however, with more women working, easier contraception, and more frequent divorces, many 40-year-old women are ambivalent about their future childbearing plans. Their fertility is in decline, but some form of contraception is still necessary. At all ages from puberty to menopause, contraceptive choice is related to ambivalence in desire for a child, body image, and the contraceptive method itself. For a psychologically well-balanced and healthy woman of 40 wanting no more children, almost any method of contraception may be acceptable. Women this age fearing loss of fertility and aging may come to desire another child. Couples with 2 children of the same sex or working women wanting a family \"eventually\" may realize they can defer their decision no longer. Women who do not feel comfortable unless they are pregnant or caring for a small child by this age may have several children and are usually considered good candidates for sterilization. They in fact should probably not be sterilized because of the likelihood of psychological complications or psychosomatic problems. IUDs are probably the best choice for such women. Good tolerance of contraception depends on the sexual adjustment and mutual understanding of the couple. As to the choice of method, oral contraceptives (OCs) are controversial because of the increase of vascular risks with age. Smoking, metabolic disorders, and hypertension are absolute contraindications. OCs may however have protective effects against endometrial and ovarian cancer, and the increased surveillance provided to women on OCs is an argument in their favor. Progestin-only pills combine contraception and therapy for some mammary or uterine pathologies. IUDs may be a good choice although local problems such as fibromas may limit their use.",

The effectiveness of mental health intervention and treatment is often evaluated on the basis of changes in the personal networks; however, the development of such measures for young women with anorexia is constrained due to the lack of quantitative descriptions of their social networks. We aim to fill this substantial gap. In this paper, we identify the basic properties of these women’s personal networks such as size, structure, and proportion of kin connections. The empirical analysis, using a concentric circles methodology, is based on 50 ego networks constructed on data drawn from interviews with Russian-speaking bloggers who have been diagnosed with anorexia and write about this condition. We conclude that young women with anorexia tend to support a limited number of social ties; they are prone to select women as alters, but do not have a preference to connect to their relatives. Further research is needed to elucidate whether these personal network characteristics are similar among women with anorexia who belong to different age, ethnic, cultural, and income groups.",

Transgression has been punished by force of ecclesiastical rules and government statutes. However, no single definition of incest is widely accepted, as the degree of kinship in which marriage is allowed and the age of consent vary. Fueled in part by the current emphasis on child abuse prevention, the reporting of incest is increasing. The perpetrator in the majority of reported cases is a male adult, and most often the victim is a young girl. Other dyads do occur and are probably under-estimated in frequency. Disturbed family relationships generate a shift in individual responsibilities and expectations that can lead to incest. A lack of spousal sexual activity is a common preceding factor. The sequelae of this breach of family integrity are significant. Frequently, the family itself is destroyed; the destruction often begins before incest occurs. The victim faces a future characterized by emotional turmoil, diminished self-esteem, impaired interpersonal relationships, and impulsive acting-out behavior. Family and individual therapy, participation in support groups, and referral for chemical dependency treatment are essential if future problems in the lives of everyone involved are to be avoided.",

Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

Individuals are born with a persistent genetic predisposition to a specific savings behavior. Parenting contributes to the variation in savings rates among younger individuals, but its effect decays over time. The environment when growing up (e.g., parents’ wealth) moderates genetic effects. Finally, savings behavior is genetically correlated with income growth, smoking, and obesity, suggesting that the genetic component of savings behavior reflects genetic variation in time preferences or self-control.",

There are girly, frilly, ultra-feminine girls, while others show less dominant female attributes and sit at the further end of the female spectrum where females resent almost any hint of being female and live as tomboys, even if they have XX chromosomes. Girls can sometimes blame others, internalise their feelings or develop co-morbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders or hyperactivity. Girls become women and the expectations on women only grow bigger. Women are expected to marry, have a family, run a household and often some form of employment too. Women must face many challenging changes to their bodies, including menstruation, growing through puberty into the curves and shapely form of womanhood.",

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos do envelhecimento",
      "abstract": "Passing in review the main intelectual and affective changes associated with age, the author stresses that psychologic aging is subject to great inter-individual variability. Longitudinal research has not given support to the old notion that cognitive efficiency undergoes a global and progressive decline after maturity. Many abilities remain unchanged, and a few can even increase in middle age; others, conversely, become impaired at an early age, by effect of such limitating factors as the slowing of mental functions and the difficulty in the processing of information. But recent findings seem to explain age effects on cognitive functioning also in terms of previous education and current activity. This sort of «plasticity» underlines the importance of stimulation for maintaining mental efficiency in old age. The same kind of inter-individual variability can be observed in personality development along middle and advanced age. Sequential research has shown that some well documented general changes, such as rigidity or cautiousness, are less important than the specific features of the evolution of each individual. On the other hand, personal goals and adaptative processes turn out to be relatively constant through adult life, and not very dependent on age factors. So, one may say that personality becomes more rich and differentiated as age processes; any disease or extreme deprivation can impoverish and equalized. Thus, as the patterns of behavior brought about by internal and external changes in old age are so different and specific, general theories of life satisfaction do not seem to be valid, as long as they are rigid and normative. Multidisciplinary studies suggest that activity theory and, in a lesser degree, disengagement theory, both have come part of truth. A temporary or selective disengagement of peripheral roles may possess good adaptative value, and is frequently followed by a re-engagement in fresh family or social roles. For the majority of elderly individuals, therefore, a good adaptation seems to be dependent on maintaining a fair level of activity and social interchange. Such activity, that must be perceived as useful, is stimulating for the intellect and potentially rewarding. It strongly contributes to self-confidence and self-esteem, which are most important for life satisfaction to be preserved.",

      "abstract": "Officially, Western societies are waging a war on obesity. Unofficially, we are waging a war on fat people. Anti-fat sentiment is pervasive, and fat people suffer a host of harms as a result: workforce discrimination, inferior medical care, relentless teasing, and internalized shame. A significant proportion of the population endures such harms. Yet, that is not typically regarded as a serious problem. Most of us aren't quite sure: Is it really OK to be fat? This book argues that it is. In Why It's OK to Be Fat, Rekha Nath convincingly argues that onventional views of fatness in Western societies—as a pathology to be fixed or as a moral failing—are ill-conceived. Combining careful empirical investigation with rigorous moral argumentation, this book debunks popular narratives about weight, health, and lifestyle choices that underlie the dominant cultural aversion to fatness. It argues that we should view fatness through the lens of social equality, examining the wide-ranging ways that fat individuals fail to be treated as equals. According to Nath, it is high time that we recognize sizeism—the systematic ways that our society penalizes fat individuals for their size—as a serious structural injustice, akin to racism, sexism, and homophobia.

Man will be able to live as well as possible and can mempuyai meaning if he can live together in society. It is inconceivable that humans who live in isolation without intercourse and associate with other human beings. In order to foster a harmony of social relationships or with other humans required a form of self-control in the association of living together called the ethics. Living in the era of globalization while maintaining ethical values is certainly not easy, many challenges and obstacles to be faced. Problems that become challenges and obstacles are increasing violence in society, extinction behavior and attitude in family life and society, decreasing pride of ancestral culture and tradition, increasing of self-destructive behavior such as suicide, alcoholism, drug use, and sex free, decreasing work ethic, low individual responsibility attitude, waning sense of honesty in every human being and many other cases. Seeing the phenomenon that occurs in today's society is more likely to behave with less ethics and morality then study Kakawin Nitisastra is highly recommended, but still many people who do not know the existence Kakawin Nitisastra. Therefore the author examines Kakawin Nitisastra so that later can contribute in the life of society in the era of globalization, in addition to preserving the classic works that many people do not know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problems to be discussed are (1) how is the structure of Kakawin Nitisastra?

      "title": "Consequences of ultra-low fertility.",
      "abstract": "It is assumed in this discussion devoted to the consequences of ultra-low fertility that \"complete\" control over fertility means control over both the number of children and, within physiological limits, the timing of childbirth. As such extensive control already is widespread in most European populations, what can be said about its future consequences can in large part be said about conditions occurring already. Thus, focus is on differences essentially of degree rather than of kind. Improved individual health among those children born is one likely consequence. This would be the result of a lower incidence of childbirth at the youngest and oldest extremes of the mother's fecund period, the proper spacing of births, and the fact that those born would be \"wanted\" children. Control over fertility also offers women greater independence and status by giving them increased opportunity to acquire education and training, obtain employment outside the home, advance in a career, and earn incomes of their own. Yet, the opportunities for greater independence and higher status offered middle-aged women in their 50s or 60s by having had complete control over childbearing may not realized because of demands on them resulting from demographic trends (greater longevity) and social trends (dissolution of marriages). Control over fertility is conducive to an older age structure; proportions will be smaller in the younger ages, larger in the older. The extent of this will be determined by how far fertility declines. The relation between age and need is not necessarily direct. Much depends on habits of life prior to old age and on contemporary conditions. Aging is as much a social and psychological process as a biological one. Some savings can be effected in public programs for the aged by introducing elements of means-testing, and savings will result from a reduced proportion of the population in the younger, dependent ages. Programs such as forced savings that enable the aged to support themselves largely, possibly totally, through earnings garnered during their peak working years will need to be developed and extended. If one employs a different demographic definition of aged, e.g., those in the age categories having less than 10 years' life expectancy at present rates, the increase in the proportion \"aged\" during this period is reduced considerably. In sum, a decline in number actually can provide considerable opportunities, particularly with respect to improving the quality of life and making human numbers, lifestyles, and consumption patterns more compatible with ecological and physical reality.",

In this, the moral discourse linking obesity with gluttony or weakness and avarice with underweight will be studied. I will also ask whether changed Christian attitudes towards the body and bodily functions lead to new concepts regarding the matter. For these different levels of questions, I take into account concepts of disability history, asking whether the obviously impairing factors of excess weight or the opposite of it lead to social disfunctionality, hindering people from important social functions and subjecting them to social stigma.

      "abstract": "L'omofobia e una forma di violenza basata sulla vulnerabilita di un certo gruppo di persone a causa del loro (vero o presunto) orientamento sessuale che produce non solo discriminazione ma anche invisibilita. Cerchero di articolare, nel tempo assegnato, il fenomeno dell'omofobia con questi tre elementi. In anzi tutto, cominciamo per cercare da definire l'omofobia la quale e caratterizzata dall'atteggiamento di ostilita nei confronti degli omosessuali, uomini o donne che siano. Se la componente primaria dell'omofobia e effettivamente un rifiuto irrazionale o addirittura un odio verso gay e lesbiche, essa non puo tuttavia essere ridotta solo a questo. Come la xenofobia, il razzismo o l'antisemitismo, l'omofobia e una manifestazione arbitraria che consiste nel designare l'altro in quanto contrario, inferiore o anomalo. Nella sua irriducibile differenza, l'altro viene situato altrove, al di fuori dell'ambito comune degli esseri umani. Crimine abominevole, amori vergognosi, gusti depravati, costumi infami, passione ignominiosa, peccato contro natura, sodomitico, sono altrettante designazioni che per secoli hanno definito il desiderio e le relazioni sessuali o affettive tra persone dello stesso sesso. Relegato a emarginato o ad eccentrico, l'omosessuale viene designato dalla norma sociale come un essere bizzarro, strano o strambo. E siccome il male viene sempre da fuori, in Francia l'omosessualita e stata chiamata vizio italiano, costume arabo o coloniale. Come il nero, l'arabo o lo straniero, l'omosessuale e sempre l'altro, il differente, quello con cui qualunque identificazione resta impensabile. La recente preoccupazione per questa ostilita nei confronti dei gay e delle lesbiche modifica il modo in cui la questione e stata finora affrontata. Invece di concentrarsi come in passato allo studio del comportamento omosessuale in quanto deviante, l'attenzione viene ormai posta sulle ragioni che hanno portato a considerare come deviante proprio questa forma di sessualita: lo spostamento dell'oggetto d'analisi verso l'omofobia corrisponde ad un cambiamento tanto epistemologico che politico. Epistemologico, dal momento che non si tratta tanto di conoscere o di comprendere l'origine e il funzionamento dell'omosessualita, quanto di analizzare l'ostilita suscitata da questa specifica forma di orientamento sessuale.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal dormancy (e.g. diapause, hibernation) is widely considered an adaptation for surviving life-threatening conditions during part of the year. However, the selective pressures acting on dormancy are poorly studied. An underestimated common aspect is the high survival rate during dormancy compared to the active period, perhaps due to the reduced risk of predation and competition. We hypothesize that dormancy phenology is influenced by a trade-off between the reproductive benefits of being active and the survival benefits of being dormant. Using a phylogenetic comparative method and more than 20 hibernating mammals, we find that the sex difference in hibernation phenology is explained by sex differences in physiological constraints that may influence this trade-off. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, the sex that spends more time in an activity directly associated with reproduction (e.g. testicular maturation, gestation) or indirectly (e.g. recovery from reproductive stress) spends less time in hibernation. Some of the tested parameters such as testes maturation or a late mating period during the active season also influence the sex difference in dormancy phenology among ectotherms (e.g. reptiles, invertebrates). We then gathered evidence that dormancy in non-life-threatening periods that are unfavorable for reproduction may be more widespread than previously thought.",

Participants were randomly induced to be either wholly innocent, guilty, or partially innocent of committing an academic transgression and then given the choice to accept or reject a plea deal to avoid disciplinary sanction. Partially innocent participants pled to cheating nearly as often as guilty participants and vastly more often than innocent participants. Partially innocent participants—not unlike guilty participants—experienced greater feelings of guilt than did innocent participants. In turn, these feelings of guilt, but not shame, were associated with taking responsibility for comparable, less severe, and more severe transgressions not committed.",

      "abstract": "Inclination toward eveningness is often associated with risky behavior. But the existing studies are scarce, inconsistent and usually limited to self-reported measures. We sought to investigate in young adults whether morningness-eveningness is associated with risky behavior in dangerous driving situations, with self-reported drunk driving and with alcohol consumption. Results show that, indeed, inclination toward eveningness is associated with these risky behaviors. We also demonstrate a link between morningness-eveningness and sensation seeking. Therefore, young adults with a tendency toward eveningness might be more at risk to face negative consequences of alcohol abuse or to be involved in a road accident.",

      "abstract": "Based on the same reasons, who allowed us to try to synthesize and expose some formulas or references above aspects or better to say manifestations of compatibility of different aspects or different ways compared to different aspects of diseases, ie in this case a competition or approach. The term alcoholism is maintained signifying a behavioral disorder with complex determinism, socio-psychological and biological, manifested by repeated and excessive alcohol consumption, with individual repercussions, affecting the mental and somatic health of the drinker, as well as his family and professional relationships, status its economic and social. The type and amount of beverage are less relevant to the diagnosis of chronic alcoholism, as well as the duration of consumption, due to individual differences in “sensitivity” to alcohol, its rate of metabolism, the rate at which tolerance and dependence are established, and the time interval in which complications occur.",
