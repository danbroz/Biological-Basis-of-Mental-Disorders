      "title": "Self-Efficacy and Emotional Competence of Learning Disability Students:A Correlational Analysis",
      "abstract": "Unlike other disabilities, such as paralysis or blindness, a learning disability is a hidden handicapped and it is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store and respond to information. The term learning disability is used to describe the seeming unexplained difficulty a person of at least average intelligence has in acquiring basic academic skills. These skills are essential for success at school and work and for coping with life in general. An important part of the definition of Learning Disability is its exclusions: learning disabilities cannot be attributed primarily to mental retardation, emotional disturbance, cultural difference, or disadvantage. Thus, the concept of Learning Disability focuses on the notion of a discrepancy between a child's academic achievement and his orher apparent capacity to learn. Learning Dis abilities affects individuals differently at various stages of life-early childhood, the elementary schools years, adolescence, and adulthood. In some cases other problems coexist with the learning disabilities. Emotional competence as an efficiency to deal effectively with several dissociable but related processes is a blending of competencies (Coleman 1970). A learned capability' based on emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at work. Our emotional intelligence determines our potential for learning the practical skills based on the five elements: self-awareness, motivation, self-regulation, empathy, and adeptness in relationships. Our emotional competence shows how much of that potential we have translated into on-the-job capabilities. (Denial Goleman, 1998). Emotional competence can be defined as the demonstration or practical application of the learned abilities and knowledge-building attitudes related to the cognitive, affective, conative and social aspects of emotional intelligence in active interaction with one's environment. Emotional competence can be a resource through which organisational relationships are created, interpreted and altered but self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviours necessary to produce specific performance attainments (Bandura, 1977,1986,1997). Self-efficacy reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own motivation, behavior, and social environment. Self-efficacy is the extent or strength of one's belief in one's own ability to complete tasks and reach goals. Self-efficacy affects every area of human endeavor. By determining the beliefs a person holds regarding his or her power to affect situations, it strongly influences both the power a person actually has to face challenges competently andthe choices a person is most likely to make.Jadhav (2010) investigated a study on a study of emotional maturity' and emotional competence of college going students of Belgaum district and reported that there is a significant difference between male and female students, second year students and government and private college students in emotional competence. It was found that there is no difference between 20-21 and 22-23 year students in both variables, male and female and first and second year students in emotional maturity and arts and science students in both emotional maturity andemotional competence, rural and urban students in emotional competence.Pintrich and Groot (1990) observed in one study on Motivational and self-regulated learning components of classroom academic performance and results revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level. Levine (1999) reported that children who cannot overcome learning difficulties are more likely to under-perform in school and become problem students. …",

      "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility (CF) enables individuals to readily shift from one concept or mode of practice/thoughts to another in response to changes in the environment and feedback, making CF vital to optimise success in obtaining goals. However, how CF relates to other executive functions (e.g., working memory, response inhibition), mental abilities (e.g., creativity, literacy, numeracy, intelligence, structure learning), and social factors (e.g., multilingualism, tolerance of uncertainty, perceived social support, social decision-making) is less well understood. The current study aims to (1) establish the construct validity of CF in relation to other executive function skills and intelligence, and (2) elucidate specific relationships between CF, structure learning, creativity, career decision making and planning, and other life skills.",

      "abstract": "Psychological problems of intelligence and intellectual development are considered in the context of designing of experimental distance learning course of personal development “Success”. The research shows that highly developed intelligence is related to the process of life success achievement. General metacognitions (reflection, strategic thinking, decentration) and unassisted problem statement are shown to be sufficient for integration of different types of intelligence – academic, practical, social, emotional – and for their discrimination from other psychic constructs. Forming of these intellectual metacognitions is included in the distance learning course for development of competencies of success. In order to give learning developmental potential, ability to promote transforming of information into knowledge and means for problem solving, a unit of development (self-development) should be designed and put into operation.

      "title": "Executive Functioning During Infancy and Childhood",
      "abstract": "Introduction Executive functions refer to a set of cognitive processes that support the regulation of thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Executive functions help us to achieve goals in our daily lives, whether planning a vacation, controlling anger or multi-tasking. They develop dramatically during infancy and childhood, and predict later success in school, health and income. They are also trainable under certain conditions. At the same time, executive functions are highly heritable, meaning that genetic differences between individuals contribute to differences between individuals in executive functions. Moreover, these differences are stable across development: Low executive functioning in childhood predicts low executive functioning decades later. Impairments in executive functions are observed in children from backgrounds of low socioeconomic status and in a variety of clinical disorders, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, autism and depression.",

      "title": "Defining and measuring creativity:<i>Are creativity tests worth using?</i>",
      "abstract": "Creativity tests measure specific cognitive processes such as thinking divergently, making associations, constructing and combining broad categories, or working on many ideas simultaneously. They also measure noncognitive aspects of creativity such as motivation (e.g., impulse expression, desire for novelty, risk‐taking), and facilitatory personal properties like flexibility, tolerance for independence, or positive attitudes to differentness. Raters can score the various kinds of test with substantial levels of agreement, while scores are internally stable to an acceptable degree. The tests also correlate to a reasonable degree with various criteria of creativity such as teacher ratings, and are useful predictors of adult behavior. Thus, they are useful in both research and education. However, they are best thought of as measures of creative potential because creative achievement depends on additional factors not measured by creativity tests, such as technical skill, knowledge of a field, mental health, or even opportunity. However, the multidimensional creativity concept they define indicates that assessments should be based on several tests, rather than relying on a single score.",

Anxiety and fear are adaptive and defensive reactions to escape the source of danger or motivational conflict. These reactions include active responses to escape the threat, which have been labeled as fight or flight, and passive responses, labeled freeze, when the threat appears inescapable. Individual differences in genetic predisposition and early adverse experiences, as well as coping or affective styles, appear to be critical predisposing factors for anxiety-related disorders. Separation anxiety is a common precursor to school refusal and also may interfere with a child's ability to enter a classroom experience. This chapter operationally defines twice exceptionality as: students who demonstrate the potential for high achievement or creative productivity in one or more domains such as math, science, technology, the social arts, visual, spatial, or performing arts or other areas of human productivity.",

      "title": "Social Skills and Problem‐Solving Training",
      "abstract": "Abstract Social skills training is an approach to improving interpersonal functioning, based on the principles of social learning theory and the shaping of behavior through successive approximations to the desired goal. The primary emphasis in social skills training is on the clinician's use of modeling (demonstrating) specific social skills in simulated role plays, behavioral rehearsal of the targeted skills by the client in role plays, providing positive and corrective feedback following each role play to shape more effective skills, and developing home assignments for clients to practice the skills on their own. Problem‐solving training is teaching an approach to solving personal or interpersonal problems by following a standard sequence of steps: defining the problem, brainstorming solutions, evaluating the solutions, choosing the best solution(s), making a plan to implement the solution(s), and evaluating the success of the solution(s). Social skills and problem‐solving training are conducted together, and may be either the primary focus of group or individual intervention, or combined with other therapeutic techniques. These skills training methods have a strong evidence base supporting their effectiveness in a wide range of child, adolescent, and adult disorders, including developmental disorders (e.g., autism), schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. These skills training approaches are also widely used in health and mental health prevention programs, improving relationships in the general population, and teaching employees effective interpersonal skills.",

Independence, strong energy, nonconformism and anticonventionalism, stubbornness, resistance, lack of cooperation, indifference to the rules, cynicism, neglect, traits that must be channelled into a mature creative behavior, dictated by abilities residing in a personality that has dimensions conducive to creativity and an inner thrust to strive in central areas for the existence. The desire to complete a state of unsatisfactory things is the catalyst of creative behavior and to allow a creative potential to manifest consistently and meaningfully, it is a central matter the early identificationand the stimulus of interests, motivation and habit to consider their workalso from the point of view of social utility, just from the school experience.",

      "abstract": "Overview The principles of coaching and reinforcement will be discussed along with case examples of the application of reinforcement, coaching skills and graded exposure for social skills and assertiveness deficits. Clinical examples demonstrating the distinction and overlap between social anxiety disorder and poor social skills will be described. Anger and poor impulse control will be examined, as will comorbidity and overlap with other treatments. A lack of social skills may be present from childhood or only become apparent later in life. Social skills deficit may arise in response to a mental health problem such as schizophrenia or may lead to psychiatric problems in their own right. Indeed, many people may have poor social skills, which interferes with their ability to sustain relationships, succeed in the workplace and live fulfilling lives. Failure in these domains can result in psychological distress and mental health problems. Situations and conditions that can result in impaired social skills include: • lack of general social skills • social anxiety disorder (social phobia) • social skills not developed (e.g. owing to being brought up in a different culture and lack of understanding of the social norms in the new culture) • secondary to a developmental disorder (e.g. Asperger syndrome or autism spectrum disorder) • secondary to severe, enduring mental illness and subsequent withdrawal and negative symptoms (e.g. secondary to schizophrenia) • lack of assertiveness • this can lead to a build up of resentment and eventually may result in psychiatric difficulties such as depression • lack of impulse control • can be comorbid with other psychiatric disorders (e.g. alcohol or drug misuse, personality disorder) • can be a standalone condition and part of a generally impulsive personality. Michel Hersen was one of the most powerful figures in the development of social skills and assertiveness training in the 1970s and 1980s. Although much of this work is now forgotten, many of the skills developed from this time are used in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings (Miller, 2012; Thase, 2012). Social skills training techniques are part of packages used to treat patients with psychotic illnesses and depression (Bellack, 2004). They are also now widely used in the fields of autism and Asperger syndrome (Patrick, 2008; Weiss et al , 2013; Chang et al , 2014).",

      "title": "Attention Deficits in Adolescence: Description, Evaluation, and Management",
      "abstract": "Attention deficits may persist through childhood and into adolescence or they first may become manifest in adolescence. Their manifestations are often more subtle but Severe enough to exact a significant toll on academic performance. Associated learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and affective dysfunction, especially low self-esteem, are frequent concomitants or complications. On the other hand, some traits (such as creativity) of attention deficits may serve as redemptive features. Evaluation necessitates a systematic gathering, synthesis, and interpretation of a vast amount of information as well as direct testing and observation. Compensatory strengths and other positive attributes should be elicited and mobilized. Management should be individually tailored to the adolescent9s specific needs and resources and implemented in a stepwise fashion. Intervention is usually multimodal, because attention deficits invariably affect several areas of function: academic, behavioral, social, and emotional. Management might include educational interventions, counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, behavior modification, and pharmacotherapy. Management should always include demystification, construction of a functional profile, specific advice-giving, encouragement, advocacy, and long-term follow-up, roles for which the pediatrician is especially qualified. With increased awareness of the plight of adolescents with attention deficits, the pediatrician, working closely with other professionals, has an extraordinary opportunity to minimize the accusations, suffering, and maladaptive, self-destructive behaviors that have been so much a part of the adolescent9s condition in the past. As we become more sensitive to the effects of endogenous dysfunction during adolescence, it will become increasingly possible to redeem the struggling young people in their own eyes and in the eyes of important adults in their lives. Optimal evaluation and treatment is likely to be taxing, time-consuming, and expensive for all involved. However, the price of neglect, false attributions, and failure will be far higher.",

      "title": "An Integrative Review on the Research Progress of Mindfulness and Its Implications at the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Mindfulness has rapidly become a significant subject area in many disciplines. Most of the work on mindfulness has focused on the perspective of health and healthcare professionals, but relatively less research is focused on the organizational outcomes at the workplace. This review presents a theoretical and practical trajectory of mindfulness by sequential integration of recent fragmented scholarly work on mindfulness at the workplace. The review showcases that most contemporary practical challenges in organizations, such as anxiety, stress, depression, creativity, motivation, leadership, relationships, teamwork, burnout, engagement, performance, well-being, and physical and psychological health, could be addressed successfully with the budding concept of mindfulness. The causative processes due to higher mindfulness that generate positive cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioral outcomes include focused attention, present moment awareness, non-judgmental acceptance, self-regulatory functions, lower mind wandering, lower habit automaticity, and self-determination. Employee mindfulness could be developed through various mindfulness interventions in order to improve different organizational requirements, such as psychological capital, emotional intelligence, prosocial behavior, in-role and extra-role performance, financial and economic performance, green performance, and well-being. Accordingly, this review would be beneficial to inspire academia and practitioners on the transformative potential of mindfulness in organizations for higher performance, well-being, and sustainability. Future research opportunities and directions to be addressed are also discussed.",

      "title": "Attention Deficits in Adolescence: Description, Evaluation, and Management",
      "abstract": "Attention deficits may persist through childhood and into adolescence or they first may become manifest in adolescence. Their manifestations are often more subtle but Severe enough to exact a significant toll on academic performance. Associated learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and affective dysfunction, especially low self-esteem, are frequent concomitants or complications. On the other hand, some traits (such as creativity) of attention deficits may serve as redemptive features. Evaluation necessitates a systematic gathering, synthesis, and interpretation of a vast amount of information as well as direct testing and observation. Compensatory strengths and other positive attributes should be elicited and mobilized. Management should be individually tailored to the adolescent's specific needs and resources and implemented in a stepwise fashion. Intervention is usually multimodal, because attention deficits invariably affect several areas of function: academic, behavioral, social, and emotional. Management might include educational interventions, counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, behavior modification, and pharmacotherapy. Management should always include demystification, construction of a functional profile, specific advice-giving, encouragement, advocacy, and long-term follow-up, roles for which the pediatrician is especially qualified. With increased awareness of the plight of adolescents with attention deficits, the pediatrician, working closely with other professionals, has an extraordinary opportunity to minimize the accusations, suffering, and maladaptive, self-destructive behaviors that have been so much a part of the adolescent's condition in the past. As we become more sensitive to the effects of endogenous dysfunction during adolescence, it will become increasingly possible to redeem the struggling young people in their own eyes and in the eyes of important adults in their lives. Optimal evaluation and treatment is likely to be taxing, time-consuming, and expensive for all involved. However, the price of neglect, false attributions, and failure will be far higher.",

      "title": "Development of educators’ soft skills: tolerance to uncertainty and thinking in conditions of instability",
      "abstract": "Based on the analysis of scientific, pedagogical and regulatory sources, it is summarised that the concept of uncertainty is considered in different contexts and meanings. Tolerance for uncertainty and thinking in conditions of instability as part of the “soft skills” of educators, which, along with other skills, underlies their professional effectiveness, adaptation to life situations, remains relevant for researchers. Properties that are important for pedagogical activity are highlighted, which indicate tolerance to uncertainty: the ability to control oneself and not fall into a prolonged state of stress, psychophysical stability, anti-fragility; the ability to master emotions, to control or regulate one’s emotional states; cognitive attitudes that approve, positively colour what is incomprehensible, multitasking, non-linear or multiple; a positive attitude towards situations in which one needs to act, take responsibility, and find solutions. It also deals with intolerance to uncertainty – various negative feelings – discomfort, threat, insecurity, mistrust of oneself and others; giving preference to cognitive strategies in order to simplify situations – stereotyping, polarisation, rushing decisions, finding ways to delegate responsibility, the need for categorisation, dichotomy of thinking, which prompts to automatically give priority to one's own, familiar and usual. Factors that are the conditions and characteristics of instability in professional pedagogical activity have been identified and analysed: poly-subjectivity of educational processes; verticality of the structure of pedagogical interaction; the dynamics of educational changes and educational processes, which is particularly typical of the modern global educational space; external determinism of education by market and social factors. Based on the results of the empirical research (diagnosis of intolerance by Badner), it was found out that: 1. A significant advantage of the average level of intolerance/tolerance of the respondents was found in relation to the subscales: “novelty of the problem” – 73.91 %; “complexity of the problem” – 91.30; “insolvability of the problem” – 84.05; 2. Tolerance, that is, the low level of intolerance of the interviewees is insignificant: “insolvability of the problem” – 7.24 %; “complexity of the problem” – 1.44; “novelty of the problem” – 2.8; 3. As for the high level of intolerance, it was found that it is characteristic of a significant part of future teachers only according to the subscale “novelty of the problem” – 34.78 % – in the respondents of the Preschool Education specialty, and 17.39 % – of the Primary Education specialty. According to the “complexity of the problem” subscale, these indicators are much lower: 8.69 % and 6.52 %, respectively, and according to the “insolvability of the problem” subscale, they are 13.4 % and 6.52 %. Thus, the novelty of the problem is the main source of intolerance to uncertainty and thinking of students in conditions of stability. Keywords: soft skills; pedagogical activity; professional activity in conditions of instability; thinking in conditions of instability; tolerance to uncertainty.",

A aprendizagem depende de varias condicoes fisiologicas e psicologicas. Em muitos casos os alunos que apresentam problemas de aprendizagem sao, decorrentes da falta de atencao e concentracao, entendimento, valorizacao, dialogo, desajuste familiar, etc. As criancas e adolescentes estao carentes de conhecimento e precisam ser elogiados. No entanto muitas vezes recebem mais criticas do que auxilio e compreensao.

As dificuldades de aprendizagem compreender as descobertas ou disturbios manifestados por dificuldades significativas na aquisicao e uso da escuta, fala leitura, escrita, raciocinio ou capacidades matematicas. Esses transtornos sao intrinsecos ao individuo, provavelmente devido a disfuncao do sistema nervoso central que pode ocorrer durante a vida. Quando as criancas nao se ajustam a instituicao escolar, nao avancam. As autoridades da escola ocasionalmente consideram mais faceis culpar aos alunos, ao inves de examinarem suas proprias deficiencias. Existem muitos casos em que o aluno realmente apresenta limitacoes em algumas aprendizagens, para sintetizar alguns conhecimentos ou por diferentes motivos nao quer aprender. Para muitos nao foram oportunizados as aprendizagens significativas de forma prazerosa e interessante.

The basic understanding of science that should be possessed by everyone, not only professionals in scientific fields are frequently referred to as scientific literacy. Intellectual intelligence helps us to understand and navigate the world on one level, but emotional intelligence helps to succeed in life. That is why some people that are academically brilliant are socially inept and unsuccessful. In addition to being emotionally intelligent and scientifically literate, successful living entails ability to tackle problems. Emotional intelligence is directly linked to self-esteem, self-awareness, compassion, empathy and adaptability which are important predictors of success in life. Harnessing the power of emotional intelligence, scientific literacy and problem-solving skills therefore means exhibiting traits of emotional intelligence while following the scientific habits of mind and problem solving strategies like analyses, brainstorming, lateral thinking and trial-and-error to arrive at solution to some challenges or problems in life.",

      "abstract": "'Quality of life' has different meanings and entails different components, depending on the perspective of the investigator and the intention of any analysis. Although there is no exact definition of quality of life, there is an emerging consensus that quality-of-life assessment can be based on physical condition, psychological wellbeing, social activity, and everyday activity. These categories can then be further subdivided into a number of aspects such as mobility, self- care, family contact, intimacy, or negativity in terms of depression or anxiety. The approach to quality of life, therefore, must be multidimensional and involve a variety of investigatory tools (Table 1). The usefulness of many trials dealing with quality of life is limited by their unidimensional approach focusing only on restricted issues, e.g., functional status, excluding mental or psychological aspects or psychological features, leaving aside functional capacity. Future investigations of quality of life, moreover, will have to address a variety of health-associated sectors, including costs, working capacity, and social care, in addition to physical and mental integrity, since invasive therapies cause manifold interactions between the individual and the environment and vice versa. Quality-of-life research should, therefore, use an analytic model and comprehensively include predictors and response variables in a given time-frame in which the impact of therapy on quality of life is elicited [1].",

More recently, deficits in adaptive behaviour as well as in intelligence have been incorporated into definitions of intellectual disability in Australia as well as overseas, and identification is directed towards establishing support needs rather than identifying group or category membership. This paper explores some of the difficulties inherent in the use of psychometric concepts and measurements to identify intellectual disability from a needs perspective. Problems of test reliability and the implications of changes over time in intelligence test norms are discussed. The concept of adaptive behaviour, its construct validity, and the utility of a psychometric definition of adaptive behaviour are questioned. It is concluded that a more fruitful definition of intellectual disability might be found in psychological theories about human needs.",

The aforementioned event-related potential research has contributed to our knowledge of the temporal course of reading. Dyslexia involves difficulties in reading and spelling despite normal schooling, adequate intelligence, and equal social economic opportunities, as well as a lack of sensory acuity deficits, neurological and psychiatric diseases. As mentioned previously, reading is a complex cognitive skill, entailing several levels of brain organization, which are difficult to differentiate with traditional psychological measures.

      "title": "Intelligence (IQ) Testing",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Intelligence tests assess a person's mental abilities and compare them with the abilities of other people through the use of numerical scores. Although the term intelligence is used as if there is agreement on what it means, in reality there is much debate as to how this term should be and has been defined. For example, debate has surrounded whether intelligence should be considered an inherent cognitive capacity, an achieved level of performance, or a qualitative construct that cannot be measured. Psychologists have debated whether intelligence is learned or inherited, culturally specific or universal, and one ability or several abilities. While these debates are ongoing, evidence is increasing that traditional intelligence tests measure specific forms of cognitive ability that are predictive of school functioning, but do not measure the many forms of intelligence that are beyond these more specific skills, such as music, art, and interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities. (1) Despite these debates, most experts view intelligence as a person's problem-solving abilities, such as adapting to the environment and having vocabulary skills, higher-order thinking (eg, decision making, reasoning skills, verbal and nonverbal problem-solving skills), memory, and mental speed. More specifically, for the purpose of this article, intelligence is discussed as it relates to a child's score on the intelligence (IQ or \"intelligence quotient\") tests that are used most commonly to measure a person's intelligence for educational planning or neuropsychological assessment.Efforts to measure intelligence have long been a part of psychology, and despite controversy over the meaning and scope of intelligence, an IQ score can provide meaningful data about a child's cognitive abilities if put within a conceptual framework that does not overstate its meaning or implications for the child. Intelligence tests are the most studied and, consequently, the most reliable, valid, and useful tests available for measuring specific cognitive abilities. Within a particular IQ test, children tend to perform the same on items designed to assess the same ability, which suggests internal consistency. The tests are reliable because children generally receive the same score when they retake the same test years later, although the reliability of the test usually increases with the age of the child. Test validity is based on numerous studies that have found high correlations between children's IQ scores and their performance in school, achievement tests, and tests of specific intellectual functioning (eg, measures of language, visual motor processing).An IQ score reflects a child's performance on an intelligence test relative to that of children of the same age. In short, a child's IQ score tells the extent to which his or her performance on the test departs from average. The IQ score represents a construct of \"intelligence\" that includes a combination of verbal and nonverbal processing skills, such as vocabulary, information about the world, reasoning, short-term memory, and speed of information processing; these skills, together, are represented by the IQ score. Nearly all comprehensive psychological evaluations include some measure of intelligence. For example, for a child who is being tested to confirm a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), an intelligence test can confirm that the child's academic difficulties do not indicate a specific cognitive weakness or mild mental retardation.Most intelligence tests assess a range of verbal, visual-spatial, and problem-solving skills. Because they target multiple cognitive skills, IQ tests are composed of subtests that measure specific areas of functioning. Scores on these subtests are combined to yield measures of verbal and nonverbal problem-solving abilities, as well as a full-scale IQ score. IQ scores are assumed to be normally distributed in the population, with most scores falling in the middle of the distribution and fewer scores falling at the upper and lower extremes (FigureF1). The average IQ score on most IQ tests is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Most IQ scores (about 68%) fall within 1 standard deviation on either side of the mean (eg, between 85 and 115), and almost all scores (99% of population) fall within 3 standard deviations above or below the mean.School-age children most frequently are tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition (WISC-IV). The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) is the test used most frequently for adolescents ages 16 and older. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence –Third Edition (WPPSI-III) is used most frequently to test children ages 2½ to 6 years of age. Each of these tests is composed of subtests that measure a variety of domains. The WISC-IV contains 15 subtests that are divided into 10 core subtests and 5 supplemental (ie, optional) subtests, which form four composites scales (referred to as \"factor scores\"): Verbal Comprehension (verbal knowledge and the ability to use verbal skills in new situations), Perceptual Organization (the ability to think about and organize visual material without the use of words), Working Memory (the ability to hold information in memory to manipulate it or perform calculations with it), and Processing Speed (the speed at which one can process simple visual information without making errors). The TableT1 lists the WISC-IV subtests and factor scores. Although there are tests of infant \"intelligence,\" such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, most tests for children younger than age 3 years measure abilities, such as sensorimotor development and early language skills, which are not highly correlated with later IQ.Intelligence tests are reasonably accurate at predicting which children will be successful in school and which will have difficulty, with correlations between intelligence tests and measures of educational achievement averaging about 0.50. Thus, IQ tests are one of the best single indices of how well a child will do in school. However, IQ test scores are not the sole predictive factor of how a person will perform in school and are not the definitive indication of how a person eventually will function in society because other variables, such as intellectual domains not measured by a specific test, parenting, quality of schooling, motivation, and exposure to culture and books, also are important determinants of success in life. Research has shown that IQ constancy increases with age, although correlations tend to be slightly higher for elementary students than for high school or college students. Generally, the correlations with educational achievement and IQ are highest for verbal subjects, such as reading. In contrast, the predictive power of IQ test scores before the first birthday are not very strong for children who fall in the average to superior range, (2) but the tests are fairly predictive (ranging in studies from 0.50 to 0.97) for children assessed at lower IQ levels (ie, below IQs of 50). (3)Overall, the general rule of thumb is that the older the child, the more stable the IQ. By age 4 years, the correlation with IQ 12 years later is relatively high (r=0.77). (2) Although many older children show little fluctuation in their IQ scores, research has indicated that a subset of younger children show wide fluctuation in IQ scores. Finally, even older children may show some fluctuations in scores in response to major stressors such as a loss of a parent, divorce, or change in schools. With these possible exceptions, by around age 10 years, IQ scores generally are relatively stable.IQ is influenced by genetic factors (eg, the child's genetic makeup), familial factors (eg, parents' IQs and education and quality of the home environment), educational factors (eg, quality of educational opportunities and teaching), and other factors, such as the community in which the child lives. Environmental influences on the development of intelligence include access to stimulating or enriching experiences, caregivers who help the child learn problem-solving skills, access to books and sources of knowledge, good nutrition, a high level of social support, parental involvement in the child's learning and education, an enriched language environment, good school attendance, good schools, and stable neighborhoods. (4)Cultural and ethnic differences in performance on intelligence tests also have been documented. For example, studies have indicated that the average scores on standardized intelligence tests of children from African-American and Latino families often are below those of children from Caucasian families. However, the available data do not support a genetic interpretation; (5) rather, the differences likely reflect a cultural or language bias.In addition to innate and background factors, an almost limitless list of intervening variables can affect a child's performance on an IQ test. A qualified test administrator attempts to minimize such variables as much as possible, but influencing factors can include the location of the evaluation (eg, noisy office), previous testing experiences that may result in practice effects, the examiner-examinee interaction, a negative stance on the part of the child, peer-group pressure to fail, or poor motivation. Other causes of poor performance can include limited hearing or visual acuity, a lack of proficiency with the English language, situational stressors, poor attentional skills, or acute emotional difficulties such as depression or anxiety.In general, children's factor scores on the WISC-IV should be fairly similar; the more variability observed in factor scores, the higher the probability that the child has a learning or cognitive disability. Previous versions of the WISC provided verbal and performance IQ scores in addition to a full-scale IQ. Differences greater than 15 points between a child's verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning scores are worthy of an explanation and may be cause for concern because many learning disabilities result in large verbal-performance splits on IQ tests. For example, many children who have dyslexia have lower verbal abilities compared with nonverbal abilities because dyslexia is a verbally based learning disability. Children who have nonverbal learning disabilities, by definition, have lower perceptual reasoning scores compared with verbal comprehension abilities and frequently have significantly weak processing speed scores, as well. However, even a 15-point difference does not necessarily indicate the presence of a learning disability. This is because differences in styles of thinking and learning are common and often are reflected in a child's pattern of IQ scores, such as in the case of a child who has superior intellect and has a verbal comprehension index of 140 and a perceptual reasoning index of 120. That said, if an extremely large (>25-point) verbal comprehension-perceptual reasoning split is present, and if one of these scores is below the average range, psychologists frequently refer the child to a neurologist or to a developmental pediatrician to rule out the possibility of neurologic impairment. Even if the difference between a child's factor scores on an IQ test is large, the discrepancy should not be used alone to make a diagnosis of a learning disability or to predict brain functioning without substantial support from other test data and observations. Finally, when the differences between a child's WISC-IV factor scores are significant, the full-scale IQ may not be a valid measure of the child's level of overall intellectual functioning because the IQ may represent a forced \"average\" of very disparate skills.To evaluate specific learning disabilities, such as a reading disorder, disorder of written expression, or math disability, IQ tests typically are used in conjunction with achievement tests. Achievement tests are designed to measure what a child has actually learned, including mathematical problem-solving, reading, spelling, writing, or an understanding of science concepts. Most achievement tests focus on a particular subject and measure a child's learning with questions of varying difficulty. The child's score then either is compared with that of a child of the same age or grade or measured against an objective standard. When used to diagnose a specific learning disability, a child's academic achievement in one or more areas is compared with his or her intellectual abilities. If a child's ability in one or more areas of achievement, as measured on standardized tests, is significantly lower than expectations based on age, education, and intelligence, the probability is high that a learning disability exists. However, these difficulties also must impede the child's ability in academic achievement or activities of daily living. Also, if the child has a sensory deficit, such as in visual perception, memory, or attention, the difficulties in math or writing need to be worse than what would be expected with the sensory deficit alone. For example, if a child who has ADHD has problems with math, the math difficulties must be worse than what would be expected from a child who has attentional difficulties. Thus, although IQ and achievement tests are used frequently to diagnose a learning disability, a simple discrepancy is not sufficient to make the diagnosis because other issues need to be eliminated.In addition, the lack of a discrepancy is not necessarily an indication that a learning disability does not exist. This is particularly true for the young child who may exhibit early signs of a learning disability, but who does not yet lag behind to the extent that a discrepancy exists. In these cases, the pattern of scores on relevant tests (eg, reading fluency, phonics skills, reading comprehension, prereading skills) becomes primary in the diagnosis of a learning disability. Because current federal law recognizes the shortcomings of a discrepancy approach in determining a learning disability, school districts are not bound by the discrepancy criteria before children are found to be eligible for special education services. However, current law also states that the lack of achievement must not be due to mental retardation; a visual, hearing, or motor impairment; emotional disturbance; or environmental disadvantage. Thus, intelligence tests typically are given to rule out the possibility that a cognitive deficit underlies the child's difficulties with academic skills.Intelligence is a multifaceted construct that, for the purposes of this review, is operationalized as the standard IQ tests (eg, Wechsler Scales) used by schools and psychologists to measure cognitive functioning in a formal environment. Intelligence scores predict the ease with which people learn in formal situations, but do not necessarily predict success in life or occupations. Measures of intelligence can be affected by fluency of language, access to educational stimulation, educational resources, motivation, and emotional functioning. Variability in terms of subtest or factor score performance may be a sign of a learning disability, but a simple discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal abilities is not sufficient to diagnose a learning disability. Comparisons of IQs with tests of academic achievement frequently are used in diagnosing specific learning disabilities, but schools and diagnosticians are not bound by the discrepancy criteria. However, to diagnosis a specific learning disability, the possibility of a cognitive deficit needs to be ruled out, which typically is done through the administration of an IQ test. Overall, IQ tests are the most reliable and valid instruments used to measure a person's cognitive abilities, but they always should be interpreted within a conceptual framework that does not overstate its implications for the child.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive deficits such as memory problems have a major impact on independence in daily life and participation in society in several populations, such as people with dementia, brain injury (i.e. stroke) or a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. Similarities in the impact on participation and well-being have resulted in the development of comparable psychosocial interventions across populations, aiming to support people to adapt to cognitive deficits or by adapting the environment. These interventions are developed separately, without using the expertise in other fields. We argue that each of the fields and the field of psychosocial care in general would benefit from closer collaboration on development and evaluation of innovative psychosocial interventions. Collaboration has been complicated by the use of different care models and theoretical frameworks, each with their own terminology. The concept of social health - the ability to participate in work or other meaningful activities and to feel healthy despite a condition - translates to the leading care models within the fields of dementia, brain injury and severe mental illness. The concept of social health provides a common language and framework. In this paper, we elaborate on strategies for collaboration using examples of interventions to improve social health.",

Each difficulty of a person with intellectual disabilities tended to be interpreted as an expression of low intelligence, rather than be analysed with the specific and scientifically grounded constructs of developmental cognitive psychology and neuropsychology. This chapter explores how low development of attention and inhibitory control, working memory and language can generate important, though individually variable differences, in reasoning, knowledge acquisition and adaptive skills of people with intellectual disabilities. In this chapter, the authors argue that clinicians' attitudes should change from a type of assessment that only takes a static picture of the IQ level of a child to a more dynamic perspective that looks for the specific abilities and motivational factors allowing development to move ahead.",

      "abstract": "Learning is an individual process for each student. People can be aware of own learning or do not think about it at all in the diverse situations of life. However, in the pedagogical reality, the awareness of students' learning is essential as it contributes to self-regulation of behaviour and self-reflection of actions, striving towards continuous self-development. It is important to be aware of oneself mentally and physically, understanding and accepting own thoughts or feelings. The integration of all areas of personal development becomes relevant, as changes in one area are linked to changes in another. Awareness of own learning directs the learner towards the social, emotional and academic dimension, including not only awareness of the knowledge and acquired skills, but awareness of own goals, motivations, emotions, interests, the personal relevance of the learning content and also the variability of the current situation, strategies for future learning, and other elements of the learning process. Mindfulness can also be seen as a powerful 'antidote' to common mental health problems, e.g. fatigue, exhaustion, apathy, anxiety and difficulty in concentrating. Mindfulness practices can be implemented at schools as an element of the lesson, but it is also important to purposefully create a culture of mindfulness at the institutional level, which can be greatly facilitated by the professional development of teachers. Mindfulness is a mental state of being reflective in the present moment. It provides the ability to live intensely in the present moment, acceptance of own thoughts and feelings, a sense of perspective and the ability to cope with stressful situations through conscious concentration. The aim of this publication is to analyze the theoretical aspects of mindfulness, the possibilities of facilitating the learning process through mindfulness practices, as well as to carry out empirical research evaluating 16-19-year-old students` self-awareness skills, the phenomenon of the presence of mindfulness in their learning process and its impact on their learning outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: The problems of emotional intelligence (emotional quotient, EQ), success and psychological adaptability to the environment in the complex and systemic integrity are important factors in ensuring the effectiveness of social administration. The modern form of social administration involves the factors of emotional leadership and emotion management, including the ability to connect with people, inspire and encourage them, keep them highly motivated and achieve the development and prosperity of the social organisation as a whole. The concept of «emotional intelligence» is closely related to the categories of «social success» and «psychological adaptability to the environment». The latter two factors should be interpreted as a consequence of sufficient development of emotional intelligence of a fully developed person. People due to objective reasons have different levels of EQ. Following this, they are differentiated as either socially successful or not socially successful, adaptive or not susceptible to the mechanisms of psychological adaptation to the environment. This differentiation is partly a genetic predisposition of a person to manifest organisational abilities and leadership qualities, but no less important are the purposeful and organised efforts of people to learn, develop and self-improve their emotional and intellectual qualities. In social management it is of particular importance, because it significantly affects the effectiveness of interaction between objects and subjects of administration, thus creating a favourable emotional climate in the team or, on the contrary, contributing to the rise of negative, pessimistic and emotionally unstable moods in the managed community.&#x0D; Research methods. When studying the problems of emotional intelligence, success and psychological adaptability to the environment, the author used a wide range of methods of cognition, which are developed and tested by modern socio-psychological science. Among them there are analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, observation, survey, method of analysing documents and results of social activity.&#x0D; Results. As a result, the author proposes a number of theoretical and methodological constructs and practical guidelines for social managers, which enable them to take into account the emotional content of administratively significant information, to maintain a proper sensual atmosphere of communication, to minimise socio-psychological conflictogens and to suppress unconstructive interaction between people.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The concept “industry” is shorthand for mastering new skills. In middle childhood, mastering multiple academic skills, such as language, vocabulary, grammar, writing, mathematics, classifying, reversing, sorting, matching, and thereby being industrious gives energy for future development. Conversely, where a new skill is too challenging, or not taught well, for example, jumping from simple math to multiplying fractions, a child may experience feelings of inferiority or lack of confidence that can impede progress in other areas of development. Low self-esteem may also follow crises in the wider family or environment. Trauma informed interventions by teachers foster resilience. Concrete skills are used and built upon throughout life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Intellectual development concerns how individuals develop their higher mental functions, such as understanding abstract ideas, mastering complex skills, formulating logically organized thoughts, and solving novel problems, which allow them to deal effectively with life challenges and lead successful lives. The terms intellectual development and cognitive development are often used interchangeably. However, it can be argued that the scope of intellectual development should be broader than cognitive development, as it goes beyond the development of specific cognitive structures and functions to encompass issues of the effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity of a living system trying to achieve its goals in a complex and sometimes treacherous environment. Intellectual development is clearly associated with knowledge acquisition through experience and formal instruction, yet intellectual development connotes the growth of a mind that has more pervasive, transferable power than narrowly defined knowledge and skills or expertise.",

      "title": "THE DIAGNOSTICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE PERSON USING PROVERBS AND SAYINGS",
      "abstract": "In this article social intelligence of teachers of pre-school educational establishments was analyzed in the context of understanding by the person the meaning of proverbs and sayings which include socially determined sense. The author of the article considers the most important criteria for productive functioning of the teacher’s social intelligence so called successful solution of human social non-standard (including – the most original) tasks, as well as the success of a specialist in the implementation of pedagogical activities. The first involves the mandatory functioning of decision-making mechanism. This mechanism, as well as other functional mechanisms of social intelligence (the mechanism of decentralization, the mechanism of intellectual initiation, reflexive mechanisms, etc.), are predetermined by individual cognition, for example, attention, imagination, perception, memory, thinking. That’s why we have a deal with automatism of functional mechanisms of social intelligence. In the field of mnemonic experience (the mnemonic aspect of social intelligence) conscious experiences are accompanied by a sense of subjective evidence of what had been happened. The mechanism of making a socially balanced decision was analyzed taking into account the complexity, non-standard social situation. This mechanism allows the teacher to move away from intellectual formations of a person as a representative of a certain national-cultural space, and, avoiding prototypes and ethnic stereotypes, to choose the most appropriate for this social situation the mechanism for updating the reflection of the subjective space, the cognitive style of carrying out professional activity, and building a development logic situations of interpersonal interaction, taking into account moral and ethnic norms, values, etc., to make a socially weighed decision. The latter will contribute not only because the teacher will adequately and empathically interact with other actors (colleagues and trustees), but also, including the achievement of the teacher of success in the professional activity. In the functional aspect we are talking about the amplification of social intelligence.&#x0D; The empirical results of our research allow to distinguish the following tendencies: 1) there are no statistically significant differences in the results of teachers of different groups (including the directors of pre-school educational institutions) according to the success of their interpretation of social meaning at a generalized level; 2) teachers of pre-school educational institutions prevail over the following levels of understanding the meaning of proverbs (sayings), as the “level of concrete understanding” and the “level of global understanding”.",

Many internalizing behaviors can be present together, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, or depression. Eating disorders are often accompanied with anxiety and/or depressive disorders, and those identified with anxiety or depression may have symptoms of both. Interventions are needed to help individuals manage their internalizing behaviours. Interventions that have been successful in treating depression include cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving skills training, cognitive restructuring, pleasant activity planning, relaxation therapy, self-management training, family involvement, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a combination of cognitive and behavioral interventions. Although anxiety management/relaxation training is not a traditional depression intervention, there have been studies that prove it is an effective strategy for improving depression. Students are first helped to understand the relationship between life stressors and anxiety and/or depression.",

      "title": "Career Indecision in Adolescents",
      "abstract": "evolution of fundamental concepts of occupational indecision–or career indecision–is initially summarized: dichotomous, developmental, cognitive, and multifactor concepts. Then, some typical evaluation tools that have enabled more fundamental research work on identity, intercultural differences, and the effects of guidance-related practices are presented. Finally, the evolution of fundamental concepts is mentioned through its possible avatar– uncertainty. Indecision, i.e., the inability of a person to make a choice when encouraged to do so, is an irritating state for the researcher who wishes to explain it, as it is for the expert who wishes to reduce it. Career indecision relates to the incapacity to make decisions about a major or a vocation. Career choices are worked out in two large frames of reference: family and school, the effects of which are pointed out. Various designs have been built, all of which cannot be set out: especially, strictly clinical approaches or those related to career decisions of adults engaged in the professional Indecision is often approached in a dichotomic–almost administrative–way, by the opposition of decided/undecided people. Studies on the frequency of indecision (lack of choice) and contrasts between decided/undecided adolescents turned out to be rather disappointing. Indeed, during adolescence, indecision often doesn't mean lack of career choice, but indicates a period of development of this choice. In the developmental approaches of decisions, some adolescents make choices rather quickly (and, therefore, are said to be decided) and others more slowly (and are said to be undecided). However, either quickly or slowly, some adolescents manage not to decide. Two forms have been distinguished: a developmental, normal indecision, and another form, more problematic and marked by a strong anxiety, chronic indecision. Undecided adolescents are thus not a homogeneous group: some are undecided and others indecisive and they undergo different processes. These processes have been studied within the framework of Cognitive Information Processing, where decision is considered as an application of several mechanisms, the dysfunction of the one being sufficient to create an undecided state. The location of these mechanisms is supposed to allow a reduction of indecision–which is not always true. Factors of indecision are indeed numerous and have been described in multifactorial approaches. A differential diagnosis of indecision is necessary for understanding the state of a person; this diagnosis makes it possible to assess the role of different factors (as lack of information or lack of decision method). These last approaches require precise data and adapted tools have been elaborated; some– among the most typical–are presented. With these tools, more fundamental problems have been examined as the question of identity, intercultural differences, and assessment of guidance practices. The assessment of these practices may be located among a body of research in France, from which one relates to college students: it is for an average indecision at the beginning of college (university) that the later examination grades are highest. The idea of optimum indecision is then taken up in a more general way: depending on situations, an amount of indecision is adaptive and the current evolution of the professional world seems to indicate that indecision–which becomes a perceived uncertainty– could increasingly become more efficient because it leaves the person free to adapt to the modifications of the world.",

      "title": "NON COGNITIVE SKILLS AS THE NEW METRIC IN RECENT LABOR MARKETS – CASE STUDY: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING SKILLS",
      "abstract": "Recent trends seem to conclude that computerization leads to the transformation of already skilled employees into characters that possess certain criteria such as flexibility, team spirit, communication, motivation, critical thinking, adaptive, multi-tasking and innovative responses, well-being, social and collaborative problem-solving abilities, etc. The prementioned skills are usually referred to as non-cognitive skills or soft skills or socio-emotional skills and in general they are considered to be major predictors of adult professional life. In fact, it is widely accepted that part of these skills is usually acquired in early childhood as well as in primary and secondary schooling, yet it appears to be a major factor of employment dynamics and future income throughout life. On the other hand, there is lack of clarity and measurement in the process of studying, defining and classifying soft skills. As a result, at the moment there are no sufficient customized tools that specifically measure the procedures of possessing or gradually developing behavioral and attitudinal skills so consequently there is absence of proportionate skills development policies. At the same time, as internet tends to shape pedagogy and overall education and training, soft skills continue to reform constantly adding up to the present yet unsolved matter of soft skills tools measurement modeling. Meanwhile, as online markets are rapidly growing, many e-communities worldwide are promoting specific sets of soft skills, usually by posting impressive job applications or by using digital matching tools that make online recruitment more attractive, interesting and promising to both employers and jobseekers, finally augmenting the already long list of soft skills. As this has been the case during the recent years, many new non-taught personal skills have been arising. Consequently, questions and thoughts regarding their methodology development tend to be crucial. In the present paper, the above issues are thoroughly discussed and analyzed. In addition, a classification of the new skills in demand is attempted in terms of recent real labor and on line market, mainly by researching through social media platforms and focusing on the recent changes in skills demand as well the ways some of these skills are often cultivated subconsciously mainly through frequent use of social media, according to social media marketers that participated in the present research. Finally, the current paper hopes to add up to the ways new skills taxonomy may be incorporated in education and training sectors, business sectors, private sectors and policy makers by proposing ways that upgrade job skills in response to worldwide labor market's signals in order to best prepare in terms of human resource development.",

Thus, even if a good comprehender exhibited \nsome de cits in particular skill areas (e.g., phonics or \nmonitoring), we would say that those variations from the \nideal were differences that did not make a difference, or \nperhaps disabilities that did not make a difference.

      "abstract": "Thinking includes cognitive processes implicit or explicit, or an internal mental perception of events or things, or a mental means by which a person deals with facts, things and events through the cognitive processes that are represented in the use of symbols, concepts and words. Thinking and style are its types, it is the outcome of interaction between several changes, such as an individual’s past, past experiences, ability to teach, level of education, level of education and social upbringing, cultural and civilizational factors and the influence of the surrounding environment. Work is one of the important factors that affect the life of a pensioner. Without it, the individual suffers from many social and psychological diseases, such as isolation, depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Work is the basis of respect for the individual and the respect of people for him, and the individual achieves many gratifications through his work, and when he loses it, he is exposed to many frustrated situations related to his inaction. Compulsory retirement is the second of the growth crises experienced by the individual after the crisis of adolescence. Compulsory retirement from work has become one of the most important problems facing them. Here, there are many studies that dealt with adaptation to retirement, which emphasized the importance of preparing for the post-retirement phase so that the individual avoids potential psychological disorders and to achieve a sound psychological and social harmony and a smooth transition to the retirement stage. Irrational thoughts come as a result of false cognitive precipitations in forced retirees, resulting in many socio-psychological problems, such as the problem of family relationships and a tendency to depression. Accordingly, the problem of the study was determined in a question: What is the effectiveness of a professional intervention program within the framework of strategies and methods of rational emotional-emotional-behavioral therapy in modifying the irrational thoughts related to the pressures of life for forced retirees?",

Theoretical analysis of psychological phenomenon procrastination, comparison, classification and synthesis of modern scientifical research of procrastination in youth were used. Results. Research of professional psychological literature promote understanding of procrastination, generalization and arrangement of ideas about specifics of this psychological phenomenon development in personal world of youth age individual.Conclusions. Procrastination is complex psychological phenomenon, its experience comes with negative emotions. This phenomenon display people response on social necessity in accomplishment of low personal significant activity. In youth individual faces not only the need to construct his own personal goals, but also the need to work hard for realization of his life plans at first. High complexity of this goal achievement and absence of life success guarantees causes young men and women to delay such activities or fix on procrastination strategy. Procrastination comes over not only common socially determined activities, but also take form of personal generalized life strategy. Expressed procrastination causes decline of personality’s life energy in different ways of his social world. It can become cause effortless life stance at all. Procrastination is nearly concerned in different phenomena of individual personal world. An “active” procrastinators feel high anxiety, anger, temper. Such negative emotions cause mobilization of their own psychological resources for realization and finish of necessary procrastinated activity. Unlike them, “passive” procrastinators feel sad, disappointment, boredom. They realistically predict future social sanctions. But they don’t finish their activity in time. In elder youth young people develop their ability in management of their own procrastination. In increasing frequency, they use this strategy for short-time planning of complex or new tasks realization. But, according to modern scientists’ research analysis, elder youth aged youngsters often use ineffective ways of procrastination. Key words: personality, procrastination, youth age, delay, anxiety, social pressure.

Специфіку особистісного розвитку молодої людини в юності визначає те, що вона вперше постає перед необхідністю не лише конструювати власні життєві цілі, але й докладати значних зусиль для реалізації своїх життєвих планів. Виявлено, що висока складність досягнення таких цілей та відсутність гарантій життєвого успіху спричинюють праг-нення юнаків і дівчат відкласти відповідні справи, точніше вибрати стратегію прокрастинації. Проаналізовано специфіку прокрастинації діяльності (відкладання юнаками та юнками побутових соціально детермінованих справ) та прокрастинації в прийнятті життєвих рішень (відкладання як генералізованої стійкої стратегії особистості). Виражена прокрастинація спричинює гальмування життєвої енергії людини в різних аспектах її соціального світу та може спричинювати становлення пасивної життєвої позиції загалом. Результати теоретичного аналізу також дають можливість констатувати, що особистість юнацького віку певною мірою може регулювати власну стратегію прокрастинації. «Активні» прокрастинатори переживають високу тривожність, гнів, роздратування. Ці негативні емоції сприяють мобілізації ними власних психологічних ресурсів для виконання і завершення необхідної діяльності, що підлягає прокрастинації. На відміну від них, «пасивні» прокрастинатори виявляють емоції суму, розчарування, нудьги. Вони здійснюють реалістичний прогноз подальших соціальних санкцій. Але не завершують діяльність у необхідні строки. Доведено, що впродовж пізньої юності молоді люди більш вибірково використовують стратегію відкладання у своїй життєдіяльності. Все частіше використовують цю стратегію для короткотривалого планування виконання складних чи нових завдань. Однак аналіз результатів досліджень сучасних учених показав, що і в пізньому юнацькому віці особистість часто вдається до неефективних способів прокрастинації.Ключові слова: особистість, прокрастинація, юнацький вік, відкладання, тривожність, соціальний тиск.",

      "abstract": "Philosophers and psychological scientists have converged on the idea that wisdom involves certain aspects of thinking (e.g., intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change), enabling application of knowledge to life challenges. Empirical evidence indicates that people’s ability to think wisely varies dramatically across experiential contexts that they encounter over the life span. Moreover, wise thinking varies from one situation to another, with self-focused contexts inhibiting wise thinking. Experiments can show ways to buffer thinking against bias in cases in which self-interests are unavoidable. Specifically, an ego-decentering cognitive mind-set enables wise thinking about personally meaningful issues. It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined. Focus on such contextual factors sheds new light on the processes underlying wise thought and its development, helps to integrate different approaches to studying wisdom, and has implications for measurement and development of wisdom-enhancing interventions.",

Skills are interpreted as actions that a person performs to acquire motor or intellectual abilities, carrying out those actions in the appropriate manner. It is shown that, alongside new skills, new knowledge and habits also emerge during the process of activity. Skills are formed through various activities in the learning process, such as work, tasks, games, exercises, tests, projects, etc. In the classification presented in the article, skills are divided into fields such as perception, learning, labor, or-ganization, communication, and so on. The psychophysiological characteristics of motor skills, which form the basis of other skills, are explained. It is stated that without motor skills, the development of other skills is impossible. The article also provides a classification of cognitive skills. A brief explanation is given for cognitive skills formed through the perception of sensory signals, attention, memory, thinking, speech, and other cognitive processes. Another issue highlighted is the relationship between cognitive skills and other psychological constructs that stimulate their application. It is noted that the social-cognitive skills include motivation, teamwork, self-regulation, organizational skills, goal setting, decision making, social intelligence, emotional intelligence, social role behavior, and so on. In conclusion, the important role of skills in human life and professional activity is emphasized.",

      "title": "Social cognition and its potential role in bipolar disorder roughening",
      "abstract": "The present issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica contains a very elegant and comprehensive review and meta-analysis by Professor Strejilevich’s emerging group (1) on the state of the art of social cognition in bipolar patients. According to the authors, deficits in theory of mind and emotion processing would occur even in euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) patients, while decision making would be preserved. It is also known that social cognition impairment may lead to poor social functioning (2). The term ‘social cognition’ is used to refer to various abilities that allow people to process social information, especially its encoding, storage, retrieval, and application to social situations. It comprises several skills. The most widely used social cognition abilities include emotion processing—the ability to identify and appraise the emotions displayed by other people—decision making, or the effect of reward and punishment on behavior selection, and theory of mind—the ability to attribute mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intents to oneself and others. In summary, social cognitive skills allow us to properly understand or judge the world from an interactive, affective, and empathic perspective. Social cognition is known to be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and severe psychiatric conditions as schizophrenia and unipolar depression. However, an issue that needs to be clarified concerns to how big is the word ‘social’ in the ‘social cognition’ construct. In other words, is social cognition impairment merely epiphenomena of neurocognitive impairment? Both decision making and theory of mind might be strongly influenced by executive frontal components, and in fact, both seem to be related to gray matter volume reduction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (3). As for emotional processing, it has been described how damage to the fusiform gyrus, in the temporal lobe, can lead to the inability to recognize faces and that amygdale, a usual suspect in bipolar disorders’ pathophysiology, strongly influences fusiform gyrus function during face perception (4). To what extent social cognition dysfunctions are merely the clinical expression of soft neurological signs occurring in bipolar disorders remains as something to be further studied. On the other hand, although Samamé and colleagues find social cognition to be independent from mood state, it is also true that subsyndromal symptoms and medications may also play a role. It is well known, for instance, that even low doses of antidepressants during a few days may improve emotional processing and recognition in depressed patients (5). Social cognition might even be involved in the sensitization phenomena related to bipolar illness. Bipolar individuals with affected social cognition skills may get involved in social stressful events more often due to their inability to ‘read’ what is happening, to weigh the risks involved in a social situation, or to take the right decision deriving from it. Hence, this enhanced likelihood for negative life events would trigger many episodes and, finally, worsen the course of the disorder. Later on, as supported by the kindling models, the disorder itself develops some biological autonomy, progressively allowing for more neurological soft signs, social, and neurocognitive impairment, biological sensitization and outcome worsening in a never-ending cycle. All this needs to be taken into account in both the pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches to bipolar patients. From a pharmacological perspective, we may hypothesize that an energetic and early treatment with mood-stabilizing agents may even have positive effects on social cognition and stop or slow down the roughening cycle described above. From a psychological treatments perspective, we should consider both the early implementation of psychoeducational programs and the potential role of cognitive rehabilitation. Newer cognitive rehabilitation programs should include social cognition remediation. The fear of patronizing the patient by using a very directive intervention would be by far counterbalanced by the benefits deriving from prevention of both some life events and episodes. The political nuisance of using ‘cognitive orthopaedics’—such as some functional remediation models—is by far counterbalanced by its daily benefits in our patients’ both functional and clinical prognosis, and quality of life. All that said, clinicians have to keep in mind the extreme interindividual variability among all bipolar patients regarding social cognition. Some affected individuals really master social cognition and are particularly gifted with social and political leadership abilities, while others show extremely poor social cognition skills. Or, from an evolutionary perspective, some social cognition problems would be apparently rewarded by the group as they allow for a more effective leadership, particularly important when facing a critical situation. At the end of the day, the world did not ask Theodore Roosevelt or Winston Churchill to be empathic, but effective. A proper assessment of social cognition is needed to determine its possible impairment for all patients given its clinical, prognostic, functional, and therapeutic significance. Samané et al. paper in this issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica will help us to further understand why.

Not usually a deficit in techno-rational knowledge (although such presumed deficits are precisely what is targeted in most attempts to fix the problem). More often the problem has been failure to build up a personal store of relevant up-to-date specialist knowledge. Still more often it stems from deficits in tacit knowledge … (unverbalised) knowledge of ways of doing things. But most often it stems from a failure to consider the wider needs of clients and a disregard of the consequences of rule-bound actions grounded solely in disciplinary knowledge. In other words, by failure to engage with issues which lie outside the individual’s domain of specialist knowledge.

      "abstract": "The article raises the issue of developing a psychologist in the sphere of education. Emphasis is made on social and psychological conditions promoting the professional sensitivity of a psychologist, which determine the efficiency of their performance. This property is the level of sensitivity which allows detecting the subtlest indicators of a mental phenomenon. The structure of professional sensitivity is assumed to comprise four components: sensory properties (all types of sensitivity – from visual and auditory to olfactory); mnemic properties (memory capacity, speed of memorizing, durability of memorizing, accuracy and speed of reproducing, ability for immediate reproduction at a certain moment); imaginative properties depending on the individual characteristics of imagination; and attention properties (selectivity, volume, steadiness, abilities to distribute and switch attention). Professional sensitivity is not static; it develops and its structure improves with professional advancement. The research showed that a training of sensitivity for psychologists in educational sphere sets conditions for forming higher levels of selectivity, concentration and switching of attention; for development of empathy, communicability, emotional stability, sensitivity, independence, and self-control. The research topicality is due to developing professional sensitivity necessary to fulfill the professional requirements to a psychologist in the sphere of education.",

      "title": "Age as a Differential-Psychological Factor of the Axiopsychological Design of Life Personal Achievements",
      "abstract": "The paper considers the concept of “chronological age”, approaches to its understanding, and features of use. The leading psychological characteristics of the period of adulthood – early, middle, and late – are outlined. It is noted that the period of adulthood (or maturity) is the longest phase of ontogenesis (in developed countries it is 3⁄4 of the human life), which tends to achieve the highest development of physical, intellectual, and spiritual abilities of the individual. Signs of adulthood are given, namely: other nature of development, less related to physical growth and rapid cognitive improvement; the ability to react, respond to changes, and successfully adapt to new conditions, constructively resolve contradictions and difficulties; overcoming addiction and the ability to take responsibility for oneself and others; certain character traits (firmness, moderation, reliability, honesty, ability to empathize, etc.); social and cultural guidelines (roles, relationships, etc.) for the success and timeliness of development in adulthood.The hypothesis about the influence of the age category on the course of axiopsychological projection of life achievements of an individual in the period of adulthood – early, middle, and late – is tested and confirmed.It was stated that the study involved 239 people, of whom 90 (38 %) were respondents of early adulthood – students of 4-5 courses majoring in “Primary Education”, 86 (36 %) – respondents of secondary, and 63 (26 %) – late adults – primary school teachers working in general secondary education institutions of Chernivtsi and Chernivtsi region.Based on the results of the empirical study, differences in the determinants of the axiopsychological design of life achievements of the individual by age were established. It was found that respondents of late adulthood better assess their psychological age in contrast to their younger colleagues – representatives of early and middle adulthood; they are also distinguished by a better indicator of subjective life, they are more optimistic, seek new knowledge, have a higher level of self-esteem and social self-efficacy, and better build a strategy of their own lives. The regularity is revealed: from the period of middle to the period of late adulthood, instrumental-subjective abilities acquire special significance in axiopsychological projection of life achievements of the person.",

They underpin the consistency with which we think, act and feel across different situations and over time. Adult personality traits are thought to be derived from early life differences in temperament; these are partly genetically determined and shape exposure to social experiences.1 There have been many taxonomies of personality traits, but research over the past 20 years has converged on the view that there are five broad personality dimensions, each of which accommodates a number of lower-order traits. The five factors are: extraversion or positive emotionality (incorporating traits such as sociability, energy, shyness and dominance/subordination); neuroticism or negative emotionality (including lower-order traits such as proneness to anxiety, irritability, sadness, insecurity and guilt); conscientiousness (factors such as reliability, carefulness, persistence and self-control); agreeableness (cooperativeness, consideration, generosity, kindness and politeness); and openness to experience (imaginativeness, insight and aesthetic sensitivity). Individuals vary on all these dispositions, so each person is thought to have a particular combination of trait strengths. Personality traits predict a range of outcomes with moderate consistency, including quality of social and family relationships, marital status and satisfaction, occupational choices, political attitudes and criminality.2\n\nThe role of personality in coronary heart disease (CHD) …",

Multibattery assessment data should then be analyzed to determine individual strengths and weaknesses across working memory’s integrated components and to identify the relations weaknesses may have with other memory, cognitive, and executive abilities, as well as academic and daily living impairments. The results of such analyses can then be used to inform interventions and accommodations+L18",

      "abstract": "The term “EI (emotional intelligence)” was first used in 1990 by Salovey and Mayer. EI involves: (1) the ability to perceive accurately, appraise and express emotion; (2) the ability to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate thought; (3) the ability to understand emotion and emotional knowledge; and (4) the ability to regulate emotions to promote emotional and intellectual growth. Adequate interpersonal skills are an important component of EI. Social skills include: interpersonal behaviors needed to make and keep friends, such as joining in and giving compliments; peer-related social skills valued by classmates, such as sharing and working cooperatively; teacher-pleasing social skills related to academic success, such as listening and following directions; self-related behaviors, such as following through and dealing with stress; communication skills, such as attending to the speaker; and assertiveness skills. IE may be as important as or even more important than cognitive intelligence. Many learners, particularly those at risk of school failure, do not possess the social-emotional skills needed to be emotionally intelligent. Social-emotional learning enables learners to effectively understand process, manage and express the social and emotional aspects of their lives.",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Making disciplinary perspectives explicit and other best practices for interdisciplinary work in educational neuroscience Priya Kalra1* and Jamie K. O'Keefe1 1 Harvard Graduate School of Education, ISB, United States Education is a field rather than a discipline [2], and therefore lacks a single cohesive set of the defining elements of a discipline as identified by Repko [1], including assumptions, theories, methods, phenomena of interest, and epistemological perspectives. Instead, each of the disciplines that approaches problems in education (such as psychology, sociology or economics) brings its own latent set of disciplinary characteristics to the study of education. As a result, confusion and miscommunication between researchers of different disciplinary backgrounds often arises. This problem is heightened in the area of Educational Neuroscience and may be a serious hindrance to progress in the field. In previous work, we have attempted to make explicit the defining elements of disciplines contributing to educational neuroscience (such as developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and educational psychology inter alia) and demonstrate how they may conflict or cause confusion when not acknowledged, using the example of each discipline’s contributions to the study of reading disorders. Here, we build on that understanding by comparing the still-emerging interdisciplinary field of Educational Neuroscience to more established interdisciplinary fields; we will use this comparison to infer best practices for interdisciplinary work in Educational Neuroscience as well as to examine pitfalls we can avoid as the field goes forward. We believe that a wider understanding of the importance of making disciplinary perspectives explicit will lead to greater productivity in the field of Educational Neuroscience in the future.

A cognitive impairment is a consequence of a structural lesion that may be measured. Neuropsychologic testing enables us to identify that specific impairment that is a consequence of the structural deficit. Brain injury results in impaired function of localized higher-order sensory and motor function corresponding to these well-defined anatomic structures, but it also results in a variety of functions that are not clearly localized, such as the abilities to abstract and to reason. The first step in the process of rehabilitation is to identify the specific deficits. <i>Cognitive retraining</i>is a systematic attempt",

      "abstract": "The significance of mental health in accomplishing the worldwide objectives for sustainable development has been the subject of research and analysis in recent years. Although predicting psychological disorders is a difficult undertaking involving numerous considerations, current research has accomplished significant progress in this field. Using data analytics and machine learning (ML) algorithms to examine patterns and find possible markers of mental health issues is one noteworthy method. Predicting mental illness is a complex task that involves various factors, and recent research has been making strides in this area. On notable approach involves the use of ML algorithms and data analytics to analyse patterns and identify potential indicators of mental health conditions. Mental illness in the workplace can stalk from various issues, and it's often the result of a combination of personal, organizational, and societal elements. Some common reasons: job related stress, poor effort life balance, absence of job security, bullying and harassment, organizational culture, poor management practices, lack of resources for mental health support, job dissatisfaction, discrimination etc… Personality disorders, anxiety disorders, phobias, psychotic-disorders, depression, mood-disorders, eating-disorders, and other conditions can all result from mental illness. Mental health in the Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI) tech survey dataset, employee mental health issues are explored in this paper for their underlying causes. Objective of this data analysis is to decrease the problems associated with mental illness by educating the public about mental illness in the workplace. This article advocates and advises on the reasons for extreme mental health practices to prevent undesirable events caused by numerous elements in the working environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than two years of uncertainty and uncertainty for people around the world. This study quantifies perceived age-based discrimination in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the detrimental impact of social isolation and loneliness, fear, and behavioural disturbances in older individuals based on perceptions of COVID-19 risks. The findings demonstrate that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived ageism positively predicts loneliness and serves as an indirect predictor of mental illness. In addition, fear of Covid-19, social isolation and loneliness are good indicators of mental disorder.",

It is possible to measure these concepts empirically, through the use of tests, problems, and questions, and indirectly through psychophysiological measures. The intercorrelations between special types of tests define certain primary mental factors, usually referred to as primary or group factors. Primary abilities correlate together to form higher order concepts, such as fluid and crystallized intelligence; these concepts are defined in terms of observed correlations. Among major primary factors or abilities thus far demonstrated by research are verbal ability, numerical ability, memory, perceptual ability, divergent ability, reasoning, visuo-spatial ability, and several others. The intelligence quotient (IQ), as measured by standard tests, can be shown to be the product of three major independent factors; mental speed, persistence, and error checking mechanisms. This \"splitting\" of the IQ suggests more analytical research designs than have been customary hitherto.",

Making a valid decision requires understanding the facts presented, appreciating the nature of the decision to be made, mentally manipulating the information rationally, and communicating the decision. The complexity of the decision is a major determinate of how difficult it is to make the decision. Physiologic changes with aging, psychological changes, medication effects, and clinical syndromes, particularly dementia, common in aging all can affect decision-making ability. Clinicians are often required to assist in determining decision-making capacity, and many instruments have been developed to assist in this determination. Common categories of decisions include ability to consent to or refuse medical or psychiatric treatment, ability to decide to remain living at home instead of a more institutional setting, capacity to sign contracts, wills, or make other financial decisions, capacity to consent to sexual relations or marry, and capacity to consent to research. Factors that can complicate determination of decision-making include fluctuating levels of cognitive functioning from delirium, difficulty processing or producing speech in aphasia, and external factors that produce undue influence.",

It is linked to the ethical principle of autonomy and to a collaborative and supporting doctor-patient relationship, far from the ancient paternalistic model. Mental capacity can be evaluated in clinical settings (decision-making to consent to treatment or research), for the autonomy in daily life activities (financial matters, contracts), and in criminal forensic settings (competence to stand trial, criminal responsibility). Decisional capacity evaluations must always be contextualized, as skills and knowledges needed for specific competencies are context dependent and specific to the function or activity being evaluated. Unstructured evaluations have proven to be unreliable, especially when assessing patients whose cognitive functioning is neither completely intact, nor totally compromised. To overcome this issue, several tools have been developed, aimed at guiding and supporting the forensic evaluator when assessing decisional capacity. A proper balance between personal care and collective interest must be found in the application of legal instruments that can limit personal freedom.",

      "abstract": "Scholars generally associate intelligence with cognitive, academic, or mathematical-logical competence.Scholastic Aptitude Tests, GPA, ACT, GMAT, GRE, and other admission tests are considered as surrogates of cognitive intelligence.Although academic institutions offer programs that are associated with this intelligence, literature on management generally acknowledges the inadequacy of cognitive intelligence as a predictor of one's success in life or effective leadership.Literature on management and administration generally ignored the contribution of noncognitive intelligence, such as emotional, social, and cultural that are necessary for successful leadership in management and administration.My comments here are on social intelligence (SI) that is essential for healthcare professionals (HCPs) who provide services to the patients.These professionals are trained to maintain and/or restore physical, mental, or psychological health of the patients.The thesis of this essay is that HCPs must have social intelligence to be effective in their jobs.SI is defined as the ability to be aware of relevant social situational contexts; to deal with the contexts or challenges effectively; to understand others' concerns, feelings, and emotional states; and to speak in a clear and convincing manner that involves knowing what to say, when to say it, and how to say it and to build and maintain positive relationships with others.This definition consists of four categories of abilities-situational awareness, situational response, cognitive empathy, and social skills.Situational awareness is associated with one's ability to collect data and information for the diagnosis and formulation of problem(s), and situational response is associated with one's ability to use this information to make effective decisions to attain desired results.These two basic abilities or competencies are needed for one's success in life or effective leadership.Cognitive empathy and social skills are needed for better understanding the feelings and needs of people, to communicate with them effectively, and to build and maintain relationships.These two abilities can help HCPs to remain aware of various social situational contexts which, in turn, help them to improve their situational response competence.These two abilities mediate the relationship between situational awareness and situational response.The theoretical basis of the four-category nomenclature of the SI construct is described as follows. Situational AwarenessThis is associated with one's ability to comprehend or assess relevant HC situations.HCPs must be very strong in this ability as it is needed to collect relevant information for effective HC from the internal and external environments and make appropriate diagnosis of the strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats in a timely manner.This ability enables a professional to formulate an HC problem correctly.",

Understanding cognitive bias requires some background knowledge of cognitive processes that contribute to how humans receive and interpret perceptual information, how people learn and how they develop expertise, and how expertise shapes the processes people use to solve classes of problems. Cognitive bias is a well-established psychological phenomenon. It has been empirically observed across time, among many different populations both outside and within forensic practice, in studies using multiple research methods, and in a wide range of circumstances. Schemas are hypothetical knowledge structures that are created through experience in the environment. The child's schema develops from her experience with the environment, and changes with additional experience. Schematic knowledge also forms the basis of all forms of expertise. Expertise development involves three stages of skill acquisition.",

There are four commonly used standards for competency: evidencing a choice in regard to research participation, factual understanding of the issues, rational manipulation of information, and appreciation of the nature of the situation. These standards can be arranged hierarchically such that each represents a stricter test of competency. The decision as to how rigorous a standard for competency is desirable cannot be made on psychiatric grounds. It requires consideration of the policy goals one hopes to attain.

In this article a number of central issues in the debate on decision-making capacity are discussed. The different criteria, which are proposed to assess capacity, are discussed as well as the development of instruments in order to objectify capacity. It is concluded that the common approach towards decision-making capacity, which is strongly cognitive-oriented, is inadequate. A number of relevant aspects remain underexposed within this approach. A broader approach is explored, which takes into account the role of emotions, identity, and dialogue and deliberation. The different approaches are illustrated by way of a case example.",

The problem of social intelligence is important for the teaching profession. Social intelligence requires the teacher to understand himself, behavior, actions and effective interaction of other people, as well as the development of knowledge, skills and abilities to achieve the goal. Social intelligence is a global ability formed on the basis of intellectual, personal, communicative and behavioral skills, providing the power of the process of self-regulation, which helps to predict the development of interpersonal situations, explain the readiness of the individual for social interaction and decision-making. The total number of scientists conducting research in this area is huge. Like many other scientific concepts, scientists cannot understand what social intelligence is. However, the urgency of the problem is largely due to insufficient study of the features of social intelligence of future teachers. On the other hand, the level of development of the teacher's social intelligence in Kazakhstan has not yet been studied. There have been practically no empirical studies on social intelligence in Russian psychological science. Despite the various methods available in foreign sources aimed at determining the level of intelligence, not all of them have been translated into Kazakh.",

      "title": "Board 90: Work in Progress: Response to Failure and Success in an ECE Course",
      "abstract": "Abstract In engineering as a profession and in engineering education, failure is commonplace--attempted designs fail, experiments fail about 90% of the time, and students do not achieve the scores they desire on homework, quizzes, and exams. Thus, the ability to navigate and respond to failure as an opportunity for growth and learning is a key component of the scientific enterprise. However, engineering education research is sparse on how students respond to failure. Research on response to failure has been extensive in workplace settings, in which there is a very wide range of negative and positive responses to failure, including denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance, working harder, working smarter, shock, fear, renewed dedication, increased susceptibility to stereotypes, blame, shame, despair, changes in interest, reassessing career, reassessing self-perceived ability, and learning from failure. Thus, these responses may include combinations of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses. Research on responses to success likewise suggests positive emotions in response to success on work projects, such as pride, satisfaction, and happiness. Educational research on response to failure across different domains and ages--not just in engineering education--has been quite narrow because research has used theories that make very narrow predictions about response to failure, like self-belief theory[1], achievement goal orientation[2], expectancy-value theory[3], interest theory[4], etc. Educational research on response to success has been sparse, but also suggests positive emotions in response to success. Our long-term goal is to find ways to help build resilience to failure and ways in which we can help students learn from failure (e.g., viewing failure as an opportunity), and hence it is critical to understand the range of responses to failure. Furthermore, to understand what response to failure looks like, we need to contrast it with response to success. Additionally, it is important to consider not only the standards of the course or the specific task (i.e., what counts as a failing score) but also the standards of the students. For instance, the same grade may be interpreted differently by two different students, one may see it as a success and the other may see it as a failure. Thus, it is critical to interview students to develop a better understanding of their response to their standard of failure or success. For this work-in-progress, we interviewed 26 students in a second year ECE course in a large public university, which is required for EE or CE majors, so we expect that students will see the course as important, and simultaneously put a great deal of grade pressure on themselves, making this an excellent test bed for measuring responses to failure and success in Engineering. Interviews focused on a) perceived success vs. perceived failure on the first exam, b) emotional responses to the first exam grade received, c) perceived reasons for that success or failure on the first exam, d) any additional study strategies used to study for the first exam, and e) plans--if any--to change study strategies for the second exam. We have completed the first-exam interviews and a motivation questionnaire, and applied a draft coding scheme derived from the interview statements to about one-half of the transcripts. Results so far are consistent with broader findings regarding emotions in formal learning--those who did better than expected verbalized a wide range of (almost all) positive emotions and those who did worse than expected verbalized a wide range of (almost all) negative emotions. Follow-up interviews after the second exam of the semester have begun, and will be transcribed, coded, and analyzed using the same coding scheme with codes added as warranted by additional student statements in the interviews. A Likert-type questionnaire will be written based on the coded interview responses. In addition, interview responses will be analyzed based on scores on various motivation scales (e.g., students valuing the content more may have more-negative responses to perceived failure versus those who value the content less).

      "title": "The teaching of thinking in Malaysia",
      "abstract": "The development of the intellectual potential and consequently the ability to think wisely has always been an important goal of education. This important landmark of an educated person is again raised today as a major issue in education, after many studies have begun to reveal symptoms of a decline in students' ability to think wisely, especially when schools began to focus on the mastery of facts, probably in the preparation for examinations rather than on the processes of arriving at those facts. The ability to think well is critical to an individual's success in life, especially in the age of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Globalization whereby individuals have to sieve through massive information, which might not be necessarily relevant at such a rapid pace, and the survival of industry and nation depends on competitive, knowledge capital. Should we teach thinking? Is it not a natural process and a matter of experience? After all, we were able to classify, analyze, generalize, deduce, induce, evaluate, make decisions and solve problems without any formal instructions in thinking. It is no longer true that being able to think spontaneously would lead to the ability to think effectively and wisely. Thinking could be taught and good thinking requires practice. Teachers in Malaysia are grappling with this issue in an effort to be forerunners in the country's drive to attain the status of an industrial country and a world centre of educational excellence. This work, therefore, examines the Malaysian educational policy regarding the teaching of thinking and studies that have been conducted in this area and their implications, in particular, for teacher education.",

      "title": "[Desire, knowledge..., belief, choice, ...and ability].",
      "abstract": "The evolution of various approaches to health education and additions from educational psychology have brought about a proposition of an easy-to-follow (thus useful) model for health educators based on five nouns: Desire, Knowledge, Belief, Choice, and Ability (Vouloir, Savoir, Se voir, Choisir et Pouvoir). 1. Desire creates the motivation which is essential to action, and can stem from: anticipating consequences; and/or an internal need to resolve problems; and/or external constraints; and/or an interest, reflecting a system of values. Motivation increases, of course, when more than one of the above factors comes into play and the effects are combined. 2. Knowledge is the cognitive competence which is acquired through direct experience, imitation of models, or \"verbal apprenticeship\" which provides the individual with a repertoire of effective solutions to various problems. 3. Belief concerns the concept of self-evaluation (or rather self-estime). An individual judges his/her capacity to act according to his/her capabilities, and the community according to its actual or potential human, financial and material resources. 4. An individual or community uses its \"knowledge\" to consider a series of possible solutions to a given problem and chooses the solution according to a base of preferences. In health, as elsewhere, all actions have positive and negative consequences. An example can be found in the alcohol/tobacco area: a certain positive image of smoking and drinking has been portrayed in many socio-cultural environments, and educational campaigns have had a difficult time convincing the public of the negative consequences of these actions. It is thus not surprising that the \"balance\" of the decision continues toward substance abuse. 5. After \"desire, knowledge, belief and choice\" have filtered potential solutions, the decisive step is left: the individual and/or community execute an action according to their ability to succeed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Psychologically Literate by Design: Four Case Study Undergraduate Modules that Centre Psychological Literacy",
      "abstract": "Psychological literacy is an approach to teaching which encourages students to consider their subject knowledge in ‘real world’ applied contexts (i.e. in student’s lives beyond university), which may be professional, personal, or societal. ‘Real world’ here refers to the application of psychological knowledge and skills to students’ personal, student-role, work, and community contexts. Psychological literacy is typically integrated into psychology programmes through classroom activities, extra-curricular activities, and opportunities outside of the core curriculum. However, for the goals of psychological literacy to be fully realised, it should be intentionally and thoughtfully embedded at the module and programme level. One way to achieve this is to develop and evaluate modules (i.e. standalone units or courses) that embed psychological literacy explicitly by design. In this paper, we provide overviews, brief evaluations, and reflections on four undergraduate modules within a UK Psychology (BSc) degree that integrate the principles of psychological literacy. These include a first-year compulsory module (‘Biological Approaches to Human and Non-Human Behaviour’), a second-year compulsory module (‘Neuroscience’) and two final-year elective optional modules (‘Face Perception’ and ‘Feminist Social Psychology’). We offer reflections on the process of designing these modules as educators who are interested in developing students’ psychological literacy and also provide student evaluations.",

      "title": "Is it possible to improve social functioning of schizophrenia with cognitive rehabilitation",
      "abstract": "Social dysfunction of schizophrenia is observed in many domains including social skills, ability to conduct tasks, attention/durability, volition/motivation, stability of social life, and insight of dysfunction. These dysfunctions have been found to relate to non-social cognitive functioning to some extent. Social skills may have a strong relationship with social cognition. The intervention technique of cognitive functioning of schizophrenia, known as cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive remediation, has its main target as non-social cognition. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on the contents of the cognitive process, while cognitive rehabilitation focuses on the cognitive process (information process) or thinking skills. Which cognitive functioning should be targeted was revealed as were theoretical models of cognitive rehabilitation, and various intervention techniques and their usefulness. It has been found that some elements of cognitive functioning, such as executive functioning, could be improved in experimental settings in efficacy studies. However, comprehensive rehabilitation including cognitive rehabilitation should be used in order to relieve social dysfunctioning or psychiatric symptoms. Some experts insisted that an individualized program with several steps, along with cognitive abilities, is required to enhance usefulness and effectiveness. Other experts said more complex cognitive functioning profoundly associated with social life should be targeted, rather than elementary cognitive functioning. The conclusions of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trails were not consistent until now, because inclusion criteria of meta-analysis was different. Finally, it was discussed how the theory and techniques of cognitive rehabilitation should be implemented in traditional rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Critical thinking is a way of life. It is learned, not taught. As such, educators at all levels must strive to provide students with opportunities to develop and practice these skills. This can be accomplished in many settings; however, active learning is an essential component of the complex mental process that results in the permanent integration. In research and medical practice alike, critical thinking skills allow the individual to consider all options, explore new approaches, and develop innovative solutions based on facts free from bias and dogma. Initiatives to develop critical thinking skills using active, investigative learning have been implemented at all levels of science education. Continuation of these efforts is essential to the development of the scientific critical thinking skills required in the medical and scientific community. Current research suggests that critical thinking skills measured with a standardized exam may not correlate with medical student performance on standardized subject exams in physiology. These results suggest that critical thinking skills may differ between subjects, and/or skills not measured by the critical thinking exam are required for successful application in this setting. Additional research is required to more accurately define how to best facilitate the acquisition, application, and assessment of scientific critical thinking skills.

      "abstract": "All people have the ability to adapt to different life circumstances.But everyone adapts to the conditions not in the same way, but in a unique way.Some people easily adapt to any situation, even in non-standard difficult situations, they leave the past and focus on the future, move forward, develop, experience spiritual satisfaction; while some are focused on the past and act within a limited framework -within the framework of fears, prohibitions, permissions, obligations, strict rules, and lead themselves to moral collapse.Such differences in adaptation are the result of complications and successes caused by certain developed and underdeveloped abilities in the human psyche that help and hinder overcoming obstacles.The manifestation of the situation formed by these abilities is revealed in the form of feeling, behavior, emotion, thought, speech, which are indicators of the inner world of a person.A psycholinguistic analysis was conducted on the basis of speech, which is one of the forms of manifestation mentioned in the article, i.e. on the basis of language units that create the psychological portrait of the character in the speech, attention was paid to the pronouns from the language units that create the psychological portrait of the character.The existence of consciousness closes the possibilities of a person's unlimited development.Therefore, the development of consciousness leads to greater demarcation of the individual.And supremacy is not surrendering to consciousness, but breaking the boundaries created by consciousness.This means the emergence of mental health.As the psyche is not only made up of consciousness, mental health is formed as a result of the evolution of the psyche in a person.Mental processes provide health and disease just as they provide human existence and life.Thus, a person without a psyche is not an individual, and an individual who cares about his consciousness is an individual with a mental disorder.An individual who can control his consciousness and develop pre-consciousness is an individual who has gained mental health.",

A set of activities for promoting higher level thinking skills in adolescents emphasises the development of metacognitive understanding of the reasoning patterns students use to solve problems. (Other psychological elements built into activities were focussed on the reasoning patterns of formal operations, the use of cognitive conflict, and conscious effort to make transfer from the activity content to wider contexts.) Examples are given, and the long term results following a two year trial reported. Although it is not possible to isolate statistically the specific contribution of encouragement of metacognition to the gains in cognitive development in science which were demonstrated, it is argued that the children's development of the ability to think about the nature of their own thinking was a critical contributor to success, without which the effectiveness of other aspects of the activities could not have been realised.",

Yet, there are times when acting quickly and without thinking may seem desirable, even adaptive. With the possible exception of intelligence, no other personality dimension or trait so broadly influences various areas of human endeavor: interpersonal relationships, education, fiscal responsibility, personal moral behavior, business ethics and entrepreneurship, aggression, and criminality. This chapter gives an overview of impulsivity from a personality theory perspective.

      "abstract": "Most of the social and economic burden of dementia is attributable to its consequences in terms of disability. In this review, we describe the concepts defined in the disablement process model of Verbrugge and Jette [Soc Sci Med 1994;38:1–14] and show how they apply to dementia. The main pathway leads from pathology to impairments, functional limitations and disability. Pathologies (any cause of dementia) are expressed by impairments in specific cognitive processes. Functional limitations are limitations in generic cognitive tasks such as remembering a list of words or orientating oneself in time and space. They are responsible for disability in activities of daily living. Predisposing risk factors as well as introduced intraindividual and extraindividual factors speed up or slow down the main pathway. We show how the model can help in understanding the functional consequences of dementia, for better assessment and management of demented subjects.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews the recent literature on measuring and boosting cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills: personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill. Character is a skill, not a trait.At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years. High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.",

      "title": "Psycho-social congruences between resilience and solitude",
      "abstract": "People always interact and accumulate experience. The experience makes us stronger, more resilient by knowing our resources, developing constructive behaviors for potentially traumatic situations. The ability to face unfortunate events (losses, traumas, crises, disability, continuous stress, etc.) is the resilience that we all possess, that state to recover and move on, to face challenges and overcome difficulties in a positive and resilient way. How we develop our individual psychological resilience is determined by a multitude of factors: our ability to adapt to change, accept change and continue to interact positively socially, by the individual tools we use in adverse situations, by social support network, contextual social factors, etc. Resilience and loneliness can be interconnected in several ways. While resilience refers to an individual's ability to bounce back or recover from adversity, solitude refers to the assumed and conscious state of being alone with oneself in a willful, not accidental, way. Solitude provides individuals with a space to engage in cognitive processing and problem solving. When alone, people can focus their attention on complex problems or stressful situations, allowing them to analyze the situation, generate potential solutions, and make decisions without external distractions. This cognitive processing and problem-solving capacity can enhance resilience by helping individuals develop effective strategies to overcome challenges. Solitude can serve as a means of rest and recovery, which are essential components of resilience. Taking time for oneself, away from the demands of others, allows individuals to recharge their mental and emotional resources. This recharging of energy and restoration of well-being through solitude can contribute to an individual's ability to recover from stressors and setbacks. It is important to note that while solitude can be beneficial for resilience, excessive or prolonged isolation can have negative effects on mental health. It is essential to find a balance and ensure that individuals have access to social support networks, as human connection that also plays a significant role in building resilience.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. In modern psychological and educational science various barriers are considered to be certain psychological obstacles preventing an individual from reaching a new level in problem solving and obstructing the implementation of ongoing activities, in particular, communication with others (e.g., cognitive barriers, learning barriers, communication barriers). Meaning barriers – a specific type of barriers – are interpreted as obstacles in meaning-making and meaning-revealing. The paper introduces a new approach to overcoming meaning barriers in the teacher-student interaction process.&#x0D; Theoretical Basis. In the learning process, which the modern theory of meaning defines as the process of transferring meanings between the teacher and the student, interpreting meaning barriers has its unique characteristics. In the teacher-student meaning interactions, the acceptance of meanings takes place at various levels. In so doing, meaning barriers may emerge as a subjective dissonance, as an obstacle to meaning-seeking activities and to the actualization of meanings at the level of awareness and meaning reflection. Meaning barriers in the learning process may differ from those in other contexts by their mechanisms, functions, and means that could be used to overcome them.&#x0D; Results. When analyzing the differentiation of meaning barriers in the learning process, the authors faced the necessity to search for both direct and indirect means of overcoming meaning barriers to learning, which could be instrumental in modeling learning situations in order to overcome meaning barriers in the actual practice of the learning process. The authors analyzed various technologies for meaning initiations, discovered their didactic effects and developing resources, and presented the experimental studies confirming the effectiveness of the suggested approach.&#x0D; Discussion. The analysis of various pedagogical technologies demonstrated their potential applicability for overcoming meaning barriers to learning.&#x0D; Highlights&#x0D; &#x0D; Psychological and pedagogical technologies for overcoming meaning barriers to learning are among the most topical directions for improving the learning process in modern education.&#x0D; Arising from learning activities, meaning barriers function as both constructive and destructive factors for such activities.&#x0D; The regulatory effect of meaning barriers blocks less effective learning strategies and redirects learners’ searching activities toward acquiring more effective strategies.&#x0D; The obtained results suggest the importance of developing technological ensuring for the framework of meanings in education.&#x0D;",

      "title": "The Necessity of Ambiguity in Self–Other Processing: A Psychosocial Perspective With Implications for Mental Health",
      "abstract": "While distinguishing between the actions and physical boundaries of self and other (non-self) is usually straightforward there are contexts in which such differentiation is challenging. For example, self-other ambiguity may occur when actions of others are similar or complementary to those of the self. Even in the absence of such situational challenges, individuals experiencing hallucinations have difficulties with this distinction, often experiencing thoughts or actions of self as belonging to other agents. This paper explores the role of ambiguity in self-other differentiation, drawing from developmental, psychodynamic and neurocognitive perspectives. A key proposal is that engagement in contexts that make distinctions between self and other challenging yet necessary allow reality-testing skills related to agency to develop. Attunement in typical caregiver-infant interactions is framed as a safe but inherently ambiguous environment that provides optimal condition for the infant to develop a coherent self-other sense. Vulnerability to psychosis may be related to limited access to such an environment in early development. However, the perceptual, cognitive and social skills that contribution to attribution are likely to be malleable following infancy and improve though opportunities for boundary play in similarly ambiguous settings. Using music-making to illustrate, we postulate that engagement in intricate joint-actions that blurs agentic boundaries can contribute to the continued development of an adaptive sense of self and other essential to healthy social functioning. Increased insight into the self-other ambiguity may enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying 'self-disorders' such as schizophrenia and eventually extend the range of social and arts-based therapeutic possibilities.",

Shyness as a personality trait may be defined experientially as excessive self‐focus characterized by negative self‐evaluation that creates discomfort or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive (e.g., excessive negative self‐evaluation), affective (e.g., heightened negative emotion), physiological (e.g., racing heart), and behavioral (e.g., failure to respond appropriately). It may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues. Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one‐on‐one opposite‐sex interactions, and unstructured social settings.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE To develop a nursing outcome label for the concept of hyperactivity. METHODS Using concept analysis of an exhaustive review of the nursing and related literatures — including psychology, pediatrics, and general medicine—the NOC Psychological/Cognitive Focus Group constructed a conceptual definition for Hyperactivity Level and delineated the indicators. The group identified pertinent data from the literature and clustered the data into the predetermined categories of conceptual definition and indicators. FINDINGS Results included a conceptual definition for Hyperactivity Level label: the severity of patterns of inattention or impulsivity in children, and a list of 23 indicators that reflect all dimensions of the outcome Hyperactivity Level. ▪ Inattention ▪ Lack of active listening ▪ Difficulty organizing tasks ▪ Inability to stay “on task” ▪ Lack of follow-through or completion of activities ▪ Difficulty with tasks that require sustained mental effort ▪ Careless mistakes ▪ Frequently loses things, excessive distractibility, excessive forgetfulness ▪ Impulsivity, excessive fidgeting, inability to remain seated ▪ Excessive running and/or climbing ▪ Excessive motor behavior ▪ Difficulty playing quietly ▪ Excessive talking ▪ Blurts out answers before the question is completed ▪ Difficulty awaiting turn ▪ Excessive interrupting of others; intrusive, abrasive, loud, interpersonal interactions ▪ Inappropriate aggressive behavior ▪ Difficulty in keeping hands to self CONCLUSIONS While most people do not outgrow ADHD, people can learn to control hyperactivity urges and live satisfying lives. Using combinations of medication, new behavior skills, and emotional support, people with ADHD can develop ways to control their attention and minimize their disruptive behaviors. With the skills of the nurse as well as support from parents, teachers, and other healthcare providers, children with ADHD are better prepared to manage their hyperactivity and channel it into more socially acceptable behaviors. By using selected nursing outcomes and interventions, the child can improve his self-esteem through the development of self-control.",

In learning psychology the well-known concept of transfer of knowledge implies precisely that students and learners are often unable to activate what they have learned in relevant situations that are different from the learning situation. Workplace learning is increasingly shaped by the sort of fluid experience, but it needs to be made explicit. Competences are also concerned with learning, developing and improving, but always starting at the level and position one has already reached. As to how the competence developmental processes can be thought of and arranged as learning courses on the social and individual levels, some guidelines can be drawn from the special qualities of competences in combination with learning theoretical and educational considerations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychological assessment aims to identify, corroborate, and characterize cognitive deficits, enabling a more precise description of the degree, type, and consequences of any impairment than can be achieved using simple bedside or screening measures. This chapter describes tools of the trade, commencing with the broad properties and principles underlying test design and structure that may influence decisions about test selection and interpretation in different clinical situations. The cognitive domains of general intellectual function, memory, language, visuospatial, and visuoperceptual processing, praxis, executive function, and processing speed are explored, and specific tests and strategies involved in their assessment are highlighted. Three detailed case studies of individuals with posterior cortical atrophy, semantic dementia, and functional cognitive disorders are presented. The psychological impact of cognitive dysfunction and how neuropsychological evaluation can contribute not only to diagnosis and prognosis but also to management of the personal and practical ramifications of a cognitive disorder are discussed.",

(1990) consider that self-esteem is the emotional result of an ever-changing collection of accurate and/or inaccurate assessments one continually makes of oneself. These assessments are based on the way one views oneself (self-image) and thinks about oneself (self-concept) relative to numerous personal characteristics such as physical appearance, personality traits, status in various groups and the like. It is therefore advisable for any self-esteem programme for children to include elements which address both self-image and self-concept.",

      "abstract": "The theoretical base for curricular goals and pedagogical techniques in general education focuses on thinking and problem-solving skills, apart from content, that should be promoted in the classroom. However, there are a variety of cognition models used in discussions of teaching students to think. Those most represented are 1) approaches that involve global constructs of thinking (e.g., \"analysis\") in a progression (e.g., from \"knowledge\" to \"synthesis\"); 2) approaches that address strategies for learning or problem solving; 3) approaches that employ a psychological or epistemological model of human development; and 4) approaches that address thinking skills that are regarded as generic, functional in all higher-order thinking. The boundaries are fluid, none is complete, and each raises questions. Summed up, the models carry common principles—students may function adequately without higher order thinking and grades generally should not be equated with quality of thinking. Also, active and social learning are preferred.",

Reified in many popular tests, it has withstood onslaughts from factor analysis, from concerned social scientists, from judicial fiat, and from scientific knowledge about mental abilities, brain functions, and neuropathology. In neuropsychological practice its use - and that of any scores representing sums or averages of disparate data obtained from tests of brain functions and mental abilities - can obscure specific facets of a subject's neuropsychological status or misrepresent it generally. This 70-year-old concept has outlived its usefulness. Neuropsychology needs to seek more appropriate alternatives to the IQ for describing and conceptualizing mental functioning.",

Theoretical is presented analysis of the semantic characteristics of the concept. Factors that prevent the formation of emotional regulation of communicative behavior in situations of communicative interaction are considered. Among them are the following: unformed subjective experience of emotional relationships; frequent deprivation; affective reactions of irritability, tearfulness, euphoria, anxiety; poverty and insufficient differentiation of experiences; immaturity of the emotional sphere; difficulties of emotional adaptation; violation of emotional comfort and mental balance; reduction of general activation indicators; frequent ups and downs of mood; manifestations of inflammation; inability to respond to events with a flexible range of emotions; spontaneity and uncontrollability of reactions; low level of self-regulation of emotional states; delay in the formation of higher emotional feelings; difficulty understanding other people’s emotional states. The state of emotional support of communication in adolescents with special needs is analyzed. The competencies that need to be formed in schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities are singled out and substantiated. Certain provisions prove the feasibility of using the following areas of psychological influence: increase the overall activation indicators of communication; learning to provide for their basic needs in order to avoid a state of deprivation; developing the ability to respond to events with a flexible range of emotions; increasing control overemotional reactions and the level of self-regulation of emotional states; overcoming outbreaks of aggression and emotional-affective reactions of explosiveness, inflammation; reducing the level of anxiety; increasing the differentiation of experiences; learning to understand other people’s emotional states; overcoming the tendency to take offense at others; learning to achieve emotional comfort and mental balance; formation of higher emotional feelings; optimization of social feelings; formation of subjective experience of emotional relations. It is determined that the described competencies are strategic determinants that contribute to improving the quality of interpersonal relationships and communication.",

A positive self-concept is \nvalued as a desirable outcome in many disciplines such as social, clinical, and \ndevelopmental psychology as well as in education. Self-concept and related \nprocesses are also frequently posited as a mediating variable that facilitates the \nattainment of other desired outcomes. In education, for example, research sug­\ngests that the attainment of a positive academic self-concept affects academic \nbehaviors, academic choices, educational aspirations, and subsequent academic \nachievement.

      "abstract": "Introduction Schizophrenia is a complex psychotic disorder characterized by positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior), negative symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Cognitive deficits, including impairments in executive function, memory, and social cognition, are particularly persistent and significantly impact daily functioning and overall quality of life. While cognitive remediation has proven effective, recent research has explored the potential of board games as a therapeutic tool. Objectives This study aims to assess the therapeutic benefits of board games on cognitive function, specifically executive function, in patients with schizophrenia. Methods A literature review was conducted using articles from PubMed, focusing on the terms “board game”, “schizophrenia” and “cognition”. Results Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia contribute significantly to poor functional outcomes and daily functioning. Improving cognitive function and social behaviors has been a major focus of psychiatric rehabilitation techniques. Board games have been found to improve various aspects of cognitive function, including attention, working memory, speed of processing, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, as well as social cognition. They are expected to enhance knowledge, interpersonal interactions, and increase participant motivation. Ideally, an effective board game for this population should be behaviorally oriented, emphasize positive reinforcement and shaping, and be sensitive to cognitive limitations through repetition and procedural learning. Additionally, they should be engaging and fun to address negative symptoms. Conclusions Board games present a promising therapeutic avenue for managing schizophrenia, particularly in enhancing cognitive function and social skills. While cognitive remediation programs have already demonstrated efficacy, board games offer a more accessible and engaging alternative. Despite these positive findings, the limited number of studies and inconsistent long-term data highlight the need for further research. Future studies should evaluate the durability of cognitive and functional improvements from board game interventions and explore their integration into comprehensive treatment programs for schizophrenia.

      "title": "Twenty questions about student errors",
      "abstract": "Abstract Errors in science learning (errors in expression of organized, purposeful thought within the domain of science) provide a window through which glimpses of mental functioning can be obtained. Errors are valuable and normal occurrences in the process of learning science. A student can use his/her errors to develop a deeper understanding of a concept as long as the error can be recognized and appropriate, informative feedback can be obtained. A safe, non‐threatening, and nonpunitive environment which encourages dialogue helps students to express their conceptions and to risk making errors. Pedagogical methods that systematically address common student errors produce significant gains in student learning. Just as the nature‐nurture interaction is integral to the development of living things, so the individual‐environment interaction is basic to thought processes. At a minimum, four systems interact: (1) the individual problem solver (who has a worldview, relatively stable cognitive characteristics, relatively malleable mental states and conditions, and aims or intentions), (2) task to be performed (including relative importance and nature of the task), (3) knowledge domain in which task is contained, and (4) the environment (including orienting conditions and the social and physical context). Several basic assumptions underlie research on errors and alternative conceptions. Among these are: Knowledge and thought involve active, constructive processes; there are many ways to acquire, organize, store, retrieve, and think about a given concept or event; and understanding is achieved by successive approximations. Application of these ideas will require a fundamental change in how science is taught.",

In the participatory planning process, which puts into use the knowledge and skills of individuals through active interaction, the study of social cognitive abilities seems relevant. The objective of this article is to review the social cognitive factors and their implications in participatory planning and designing. Social cognitions are observed early in childhood and they develop over decades through experience. It appears that they are partially independent of formal intelligence. The existing data suggests that social cognition may have a biological basis in the form of neurophysiological substrates and genetic loci. Social cognitions help in comprehending, adjusting interpretations, thinking of multiple alternatives, social problem solving and in various other processes. Social cognitions are instrumental in dealing with a variety of interpersonal problems observed during interactions in the group and in coping with potential stressors like negative outcomes. Various factors like positive mood states, belief in self-efficacy and goals may affect social cognition and planning and decision-making processes. These findings suggest that practitioners and researchers of participatory change processes should pay attention to social cognition.",

      "abstract": "Theoretical analysis of the concept of helplessness has been done in the article; psychological peculiarities of interrelations between helplessness and self-esteem have been disclosed; and it has been found out that emergence of learned helplessness depends on a self-esteem level that may change in the process of solving issues of different complexity. Low self-esteem is one of the main factors of helplessness formation of a personality. Personality with lowered self-esteem feels humiliation and helplessness that may confuse, looks uncertain, self-accuses even in such situations where own guilt may not be there, almost always looks anxious, even sometimes it may lead to neurotic behavior. People with such level of self-esteem do not set a goal that will be difficult to achieve, they are limited to solving everyday easyt tasks, but at the same time they seem to be too critical to themselves. One of the main ways to overcome helplessness are: formation of adequate self-esteem, feeling of own dignity, success experience, self-control, formation of responsibility for the action taken, etc. Thanks to such achievements a personality can not only get rid of the feeling of helplessness, but also learn how to better interact with society, to achieve success both in personal life and in professional activity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The type of unconscious influences that matter in the everyday lives of everyday people are those of which they are unaware, whether or not they are aware of the events, people, and situations that trigger them. Research across multiple domains of psychology shows that our “free” choices, preferences, motives, and social behavior are all shaped by these unconscious operations. They arise from various sources, including (1) evolved primary motives for survival and safety, (2) early childhood experiences for which there is later no explicit memory; (3) carryover (priming) effects of experiences from one situation into the next; and (4) the transformational impact of our active goals on attention, preferences, and behavior. These effects have now been demonstrated in many real-life settings, including eating and health behavior, consumer purchasing, and teamwork and individual performance in the workplace, with unconscious effects in the field significantly stronger than those in the lab.",

      "title": "How Social Psychological Factors May Modulate Auditory and Cognitive Functioning During Listening",
      "abstract": "The framework for understanding effortful listening (FUEL) draws on psychological theories of cognition and motivation. In the present article, theories of social-cognitive psychology are related to the FUEL. Listening effort is defined in our consensus as the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a task that involves listening. Listening effort depends not only on hearing difficulties and task demands but also on the listener’s motivation to expend mental effort in challenging situations. Listeners’ cost/benefit evaluations involve appraisals of listening demands, their own capacity, and the importance of listening goals. Social psychological factors can affect a listener’s actual and self-perceived auditory and cognitive abilities, especially when those abilities may be insufficient to readily meet listening demands. Whether or not listeners experience stress depends not only on how demanding a situation is relative to their actual abilities but also on how they appraise their capacity to meet those demands. The self-perception or appraisal of one’s abilities can be lowered by poor self-efficacy or negative stereotypes. Stress may affect performance in a given situation and chronic stress can have deleterious effects on many aspects of health, including auditory and cognitive functioning. Social support can offset demands and mitigate stress; however, the burden of providing support may stress the significant other. Some listeners cope by avoiding challenging situations and withdrawing from social participation. Extending the FUEL using social-cognitive psychological theories may provide valuable insights into how effortful listening could be reduced by adopting health-promoting approaches to rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. The article hopes to provide a theoretical analysis of research papers dedicated to the way various uncertainty effects influence personality development. The uncertainty phenomenon has to be considered due to the research field enhancement while elaborating adequate patterns of personality development meaning regulation. Theoretical Basis. Uncertainty effects are revealed epistemically and ontologically in the objective sphere, and existentially and phenomenologically in the subjective sphere. Results. Epistemically uncertainty effects are a changeable level of cognitive reflection; continuity of certainty and uncertainty; ambiguous, incomplete and insufficient information; lack of human knowledge about human abilities; disregard for casualties and anomalies; blurred and multiple current psychological paradigms. Ontologically uncertainty effects are relativity of existence; development points with equal probability; a chance of synergistic effect; different human abilities of achieving goals within their existence; aspiration to gain new personal experience; different susceptibility to development pathway deviations. Existentially uncertainty effects are the absence of well-defined external clues in search of life purpose; personality development crises; discrepancy in tolerance levels towards uncertainty; discrepancy in credibility levels towards the world; nonidentity of individuals’ personal experiences; different ideas of action purposes; discrepancy in contradiction levels of interaction between an individual and the society; an unbalanced combination of rational and emotional perception; impossibility of permanent psychological comfort. Phenomenologically uncertainty effects are success and failure expectation risks; different motivation levels; “learned helplessness”; learning interferences due to implicit knowledge; lack of time for reflection over decisions; a subconscious phase of decision making; conscious and subconscious meaning attribution. Discussion. An individual has to act under the influence of many uncertainty effects. Taking this into consideration allows a more full-fledged theoretical and empiric study of personality development processes.",

      "title": "FEATURES OF STUDENTS’ PROCRASTINATION",
      "abstract": "Abstract. The article carries out a theoretical and methodological analysis of the phenomenon of procrastination. In psychology, procrastination is understood as a constant postponement and non-fulfillment of planned tasks. It is different from a simple correction of plans or laziness. A person is well aware that non-fulfillment of certain cases can have negative consequences (non-fulfillment at all, late execution, excessive extra effort for deadlines, condemnation of relatives, lack of sleep), however. Again and again a person postpones it. That is why procrastination is often accompanied by various negative emotional states: guilt, anxiety, discomfort, a sense of inability to control the situation. Procrastination is usually manifested in activities, the result of which is very important for the individual. Students have all kinds of procrastination, but academic procrastination is the most common. Most often studentsʼs procrastination occurs in situations that involve intellectual stress, require self-organization and activity planning, with deferred remuneration, not sufficiently motivated. The classic of academic procrastination is to prepare for the exam on the last day, to write a term paper the day before the defense, or even to write it at night. Chronic procrastination is characteristic of students who have chosen the wrong specialty and the wrong educational institution, so they study without interest and try to complete educational tasks on the last day. In addition, such students show an inability to organize their activities, forgetfulness, general behavioral rigidity. There are the factors that cause procrastination in the studentʼs environment. They are psychological, socio-psychological, pedagogical and psychophysiological factors. An empirical study has shown that procrastination is common to all students, but manifests in varies degrees. There are some causes of procrastination that the students indicated. They are inability to plan, lack of time, lack of motivation, fatigue, health, too many tasks, uninteresting tasks, lack of willpower, the presence of other important tasks. It should be said that both groups with a low level of procrastination and with a high level of procrastination there are students who have a positive attitude to procrastination. They see the benefit of procrastination, explaining that they have time to have a rest, time to find more effective way to achieve a desired result, thus considering procrastination a natural state of reduced activity. In the group of students with a low level of procrastination the success rate is higher than in the groups of students with medium and high levels of procrastination. In the group of students with a low level of procrastination there is a high overall ability to self-regulate. High self-regulation of laziness is a characteristic of students with low levels of procrastination.",

The Capability Approach was used as an inspiration to explore with designers how it has influenced their lives through an interactive installation and in-depth interviews. Respondents reported better imagination, reasoning, thinking, using of skills and talents, freedom of expression, and ability to imagine another’s situation as a result of their designerly attitude. It is argued that integrating design thinking in educational models potentially transforms how people interact in society.",

      "title": "Dynamics of Intellectual Confidence in Problem Solving",
      "abstract": "Background. The problem of criteria for evaluating solution success is one of the most important for psychology of creative thinking. Evaluation of the solution by the subject during the process of thinking in the form of «confidence / doubt» can be criteria and basis for subject's experiencing potential success or failure, which leads to continuation or stop in solving. The objective. The study was to research the dynamics of intellectual confidence / doubt at different stages of problem-solving process. Sample. The study involved 66 university students, specialists and non- specialists in relation to the content of the tasks. Methods. The subjects solved 8 problematic tasks of scientific and artistic content with hints and estimate interest and confidence at different stages of solving with subjective scales. The following methods were used for intellectual characteristics: \"Raven's Progressive Matrices\", \"Complex Analogies\". Results. 6 types of dynamics of intellectual confidence were identified, which correlated in various ways with the success of the solution. Successful solution of problematic scientific situations for specialists is associated with confidence at every stage, for non-specialists it is associated with doubts at the stages of understanding the problem and the formulation of solution. For problematic situations of artistic content solved by non-specialist, the following types of dynamics are associated with successful solution: «doubt — doubt — confidence», «confidence at all stages»; the latter was also observed with an unsuccessful solution. For this reason 2 types of confidence were identified: (1) reasonable, based on hints, leading to a successful solution, and (2) non- reasonable, without relying on a hint, not leading to a successful solution. Conclusion. The procedural criteria to evaluate solution are the intellectual emotions of confidence or doubt that regulate the process of thinking. Depending on the stage of solution and the content of the task, intellectual confidence changes in different ways for specialists and non-specialists, performing the function of a preliminary assessment and regulation of solving process.",

Reported throughout much of this century as objects of amazement, and familiar through the popular press to the general public, there has been a recent surge in experimental studies attempting to describe components of the development of savant abilities, and to determine mental processes used to accomplish these tasks. This survey examines the psychological aspects of the savant syndrome, focusing on the means by which certain abilities, particularly calendar calculation, are accomplished, and highlighting variables postulated as important for development of the syndrome. Implications for the education of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities are discussed, including the relevance of this literature to theories of general intelligence.",

Many older adults, aware of such cognitive changes, seek ways to bolster their cognitive functioning. Evidence based on the cognitive aging literature supports a number of factors associated with cognitive functioning. These factors include physical exercise, intellectual exercise, nutrition, sleep hygiene, social interaction, and mood and emotional state. These factors can be manipulated and woven together by nurses and other health professionals to develop an easy-to-use, non-invasive cognitive prescription for improving the cognitive health of older adults. An example and directions for developing and implementing cognitive prescriptions are described.",

      "abstract": "The aim of our research is to show psychological peculiarities of procrastination as the important problem in Modern Psychology, to describe the results of our research of the level of procrastination of teenagers. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, and generalization. The experimental method was the method of organizing empirical research. The results of the research. Respondents with a low level of procrastination are highly organized and efficient in completing tasks. They are usually able to plan their activities with precision and adhere to the planned schedule, which allow them to avoid procrastination and postponing tasks for later. This ability to complete tasks in time is the result of well-developed time management skills, organization, and self-discipline. Pupils with a low level of procrastination are able to tune into completing tasks, even if they require significant effort or difficulties arise. They can also work effectively under stress, when they are affected by several tasks at once. Conclusions. Procrastination, as a multifactorial psychological phenomenon, has come a long way from a simple understanding as laziness to the modern interpretation as a complex psychological process. Its emergence and development are associated with the evolution of views on human behavior, motivation and internal conflicts. From ancient times to the present day, procrastination has been changed in its understanding, and today it is considered not only as a personal flaw, but as a problem that requires special attention and intervention.",

Whenever we are not able to rely on overlearned routines, we must concentrate on and continuously monitor our actions. This is not restricted to practical actions but holds equally well for every kind of social interaction and every kind of intellectual activity. In this sense, attentional functions can be considered as fundamental processes. When we are inattentive, 'unconcentrated', a number of things that go on around us escape our notice. We get distracted and digress, we do not remember details afterwards. Practical actions get difficult, and we make mistakes. Thus, impairments in attentional functions have far-reaching consequences for an individual's participation in almost every area of life, everyday activities, education, work, traffic, and nearly every other conceivable activity.",

Placed in situations in which we feel threatened, or which implicate our values, our brains, relying on those implicitly learned, emotionally weighted, memories, may react automatically, without reflection or the opportunity for reflective interdiction. We can downshift, to primitive, self-protective problem solving techniques.

      "abstract": "This study provides an empirical test of a previously proposed assertion that intelligence as adaptation has an attitudinal as well as an ability component. The ability component deals with what the basic knowledge and skills are that underlie intelligence, and how much of each one an individual has. The attitudinal component deals with how an individual chooses to deploy the abilities they have. In other words, to what use are the abilities put? It is argued that it is impossible fully to separate the measurement of the ability component from the attitudinal one. In a diverse population, even taking an intelligence test will show itself to involve an attitude toward the test, which may enhance or detract from performance, as when one sees the test as irrelevant or harmful to one’s life, or as a sociocultural misfit to one’s life experience. To succeed, people need not only to have abilities, but attitudes that put those abilities to effective use to accomplish individuals’ life goals. In the study, we found that intelligent attitudes are related, but non-identical, to germane constructs, such as wisdom, the need for cognition, creativity, and openness to experience. Scores on the attitudinal measure were not related to scores on tests of fluid intelligence and academic abilities/achievement. Thus, the range of attitudes regarding how to deploy intelligence can vary over ability levels.",

Celui-ci fait surgir des questions nouvelles pour lesquelles il n'existe pas encore de connaissances bien etablies, qu'il s'agisse de la dimension physiologique ou psychologique du vieillissement. En ce qui concerne la dimension psychologique, il est incontestable que le vieillissement s'accompagne d'une diminution des performances cognitives des sujets. Les modeles elabores depuis une dizaine d'annees en psychologie cognitive permettent a cette discipline d'etre particulierement bien avancee pour expliquer les deficits cognitifs. Cet ouvrage confirme la pertinence de deux approches explicatives, l'une globale, l'autre analytique. L'approche globale traite des effets du vieillissement sur la memoire de travail, l'attention, les fonctions d'execution et de controle. Sont examinees, dans l'approche analytique, la capacite de denomination, la comprehension et la memorisation d'enonces, la capacite de representation visuo-spatiale, la perception du temps ou encore la detection d'incongruites dans la perception d'un visage connu. Neanmoins, de nouvelles perspectives d'explication peuvent etre envisagees en invoquant des atteintes neurologiques ou des deficits sensoriels.",

      "abstract": "A series of vignette examples taken from psychological research on motivation, emotion, decision making, and attitudes illustrates how the influence of unconscious processes is often measured in a range of different behaviors. However, the selected studies share an apparent lack of explicit operational definition of what is meant by consciousness, and there seems to be substantial disagreement about the properties of conscious versus unconscious processing: Consciousness is sometimes equated with attention, sometimes with verbal report ability, and sometimes operationalized in terms of behavioral dissociations between different performance measures. Moreover, the examples all seem to share a dichotomous view of conscious and unconscious processes as being qualitatively different. It is suggested that cognitive research on consciousness can help resolve the apparent disagreement about how to define and measure unconscious processing, as is illustrated by a selection of operational definitions and empirical findings from modern cognitive psychology. These empirical findings also point to the existence of intermediate states of conscious awareness, not easily classifiable as either purely conscious or purely unconscious. Recent hypotheses from cognitive psychology, supplemented with models from social, developmental, and clinical psychology, are then presented all of which are compatible with the view of consciousness as a graded rather than an all-or-none phenomenon. Such a view of consciousness would open up for explorations of intermediate states of awareness in addition to more purely conscious or purely unconscious states and thereby increase our understanding of the seemingly “unconscious” aspects of mental life.",

In this work, we examine the question: is it possible to evaluate intelligence of another intelligent learner efficiently, without a full independent resampling of its sensory environment and the distribution of responses? In the framework of evaluation based on the generality of knowledge interpreted as the uniformity of the distribution of the empirical success over the sensory scope, the efficiency of assessment necessitates, as we show, a strong degree of proximity, the cognitive association between the assessor and the learner. Outside of the region where such association can be reasonably established or presumed, equivalence, ordering and/or ranking of the learner’s intelligence cannot be determined both accurately and efficiently. This result can have important implications for the program of Artificial General Intelligence that may eventually produce a cohort of secondary intelligent systems capable of determining their cognitive development with a certain degree of autonomy and independence. Progressive divergence of sensory scopes in such scenarios can result in our diminishing ability not only to control but to evaluate and understand them as well.",

The single greatest obstacle to devising appropriate assessment tools in this field is lack of an accepted definition of 'deafblindness'. A.B. Best, amongst others, has argued in favour of a relatively purist position in defining deafblindness. Assessment pluralism should be reflected throughout a deafblind learner's life. When assessment is norm-referenced, that is, based on a 'sample population', assessment can become testing. Norm-referenced assessment and testing can become a tool for establishing and maintaining power and relationships in society. Functional assessment should certainly include assessment of the learner's own constellation of abilities and disabilities: cognitive abilities, sensory and perceptual abilities; memory, planning, learning and problem solving; communicative abilities. Functional assessment approaches assume it is not possible to prescribe for each and every possible situation that may arise with a learner.",

Most definitions of SA focus on the awareness part and neglect the definition of a situation. SA measurement methods may be broken down as follows: direct system performance measures, direct experimental measures, verbal protocols, and subjective measures. Mission-goal awareness refers to the need to keep current with respect to the phase of the mission and the currently active goals that are to be satisfied. The ideal SA reflects the analyst's front-end analysis to identify information and knowledge requirements; requirements that are formulated with SA in mind. The difference between achievable ideal and actual SA creates the space for evaluating individual differences in the ability to achieve SA and for developing training opportunities. The subject of measurement encompasses more than just the selection of performance measures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Being in existential poverty means living in a state of, or near, persistent material poverty while also being socially excluded, marginalized, or disadvantaged. It is a life‐disempowering experience, one that privileges both immediacy over the future, and welfare over work. This results in learned helplessness, manifesting as a lack of will to take control of life. The existentialist explanation is that those in this mental state do not have an authentic way of life. Positive Psychology, and its offshoot, Positive Organizational Behavior, provide the cognitive change strategies that focus on building in people their sense of self‐efficacy, optimism, hope, resilience, and subjective well‐being, as well as their emotional intelligence, all of which are mental attributes that have demonstrable positive impacts on human performance. This can enable people to pursue gainful, meaningful, and sustained self‐actualizing vocation, so lifting them out of persistent material poverty. The public policy challenges are (1) to determine whether it is in the public interest to redress the negative agental consequences of welfare dependency; (2) to redesign the features of social assistance programs that exacerbate learned helplessness amongst beneficiaries; and (3) to determine how best to reduce the psychologically incapacitating effects of welfare dependency.",

Development also involves the construction of other domains of thought, particularly the conventional and personal. Consequently, decisions about social situations can entail recognition of different components within the moral domain, as well as other domains. Social decisions involve processes of coordination or the weighing and balancing of different considerations and goals. As a means of illustrating processes of coordination in behaviors, the acts of researchers and participants in the studies by Milgram on so-called obedience to authority are analyzed. The actions of participants are interpreted not as obedience but as entailing conflicts between concerns with pain inflicted by the instructed supposed electric shocks and concerns with fulfilling the scientific aims of the research enterprise (similar to the processes involved in the decisions of the researchers). More generally, research on children's judgments of the roles of authorities is considered, showing that across ages, they make distinctions between appropriate and inappropriate commands from persons in positions of authority. Processes of coordination are involved in the development of moral thinking and in judgments leading to actions.",

      "abstract": "Addressing practical, perennial problems with no discernible solutions (e.g., income insecurity, food insecurity, housing insecurity, health inequality, unsustainability) generates moral fallout–people could be harmed. As a profession, family and consumer sciences/home economics mandates that its practitioners hold deep obligations to the public they serve. Thus, morally- bound practice cannot go unchecked. Family and consumer sciences (FCS) professionals can bolster their professional accountability if they embrace eight professional imperatives, which range from the abstract and the theoretical to the concrete. These include being philosophically grounded, ethically compelled, morally obligated, values oriented, ideologically aware, theoretically mature, intellectually savvy, and competent and skilled. When embraced, these imperatives will better ensure professional accountability by FCS practitioners.",

Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social-contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.",

The mentally handicapped for whom rehabilitation programs are designed often constitute an extremely heterogeneous group in terms of symptoms, ability to function, and potential for rehabilitation. What they have in common is long-term incapacitation, which requires help and care. This incapacitation is basically social (stigimatization, isolation, poverty, unemployment) and psychological (loss of self-esteem); though it is a consequence of the illness, this incapacitation has an active side in that it works to make the personality even more fragile and precipitates relapses. Wolfensberger [1] has described very well the impact of the negative social roles usually imposed on people who have suffered social devaluation. According to him, everything we perceive through our senses is judged, consciously or unconsciously, positively or negatively, by another person. Moreover, the devaluation of a person is a product of how he is perceived by the",

      "abstract": "The article gives a psychological and psychopathological view on the phenomenon of workaholism (addiction to working). Work does not only allow a person to satisfy their need to earn their living, but it also is a socially acceptable way to solve their own personal psychological problems. Addiction to working is a socially approved and rewarding behavior pattern in many countries of the world. The author describes positive psychological functions of working activity, such as structuration of a person's life, assistance in achieving a certain level of mastery, making their life more creative, possibility to adapt to a real world, personal maturing, forming a positive self‐rating, possibility to communicate and satisfy their physical needs. Negative effects include moral and ethical regulation of a person's sublimated basic needs, a neurotic addiction to working, which is pathogenic in its nature. The article presents psychological and psychiatric signs of pathological addiction to working, which can be regarded either within non‐chemical addiction or as a neurotic obsessive‐compulsive disorder. Workaholism can be considered as a clinical phenomenon when there are signs of excessive addiction to working accompanied by changes in mental state; of compulsive yearning for permanent success and appraisal; of domineering anxiety, inclination towards perfectionism and constant doubts in psychological status; of egotism; of tapering a circle of interests to those only connected with work; of ambitiousness and inclination for competition; of explicit desire to be in the know and to influence the course of events; of inability to refuse to take up extra work; of vulnerability to criticism; of preferring work to rest or working at the time intended for rest. The author also describes types of workaholics and points out the risk factors of developing addiction to working, such as family education traditions, management style and corporate culture, social, psychological and cultural factors. It was underlined that an educational strategy plays a significant role in preventing workaholism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cognition is the ability to know and think, using intellect, logic, reasoning, memory, and all of the higher cortical functions. Intact cognition allows humans to appreciate their inner and outer worlds, and to interact with others and negotiate daily life. Thus, appropriate communication and comprehension depend not only on speech and language abilities (Chapter 4) and the absence of a thought disorder (Chapter 5), but also on other brain functions that relate to cognition and intellect. These functions should be indirectly and directly assessed during the MSE interview. In contrast to the other portions of the MSE, cognition is tested in a structured fashion. Specific assessment of a variety of cognitive functions should be completed during patient examination. In many cases, it is useful to administer one of any number of standardized screening cognitive tests so that the patient’s performance can be compared to normative data from a larger population of persons. The use of standardized tests allows a comparison to the patient’s performance at a different time or when tested by a different examiner. Test scores can be recorded in the chart and graphed over time. Standardized tests range from cognitive screening tests to be used at the bedside or in the office to formal neuropsychologic testing. Screening tests can be administered in a brief period and are usually comprised of a small number of items that assess different cognitive and language abilities. One of the most widely used screening tests is the Mini-Mental state exam (see Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh, 1975), which superficially assesses a variety of cognitive functions. Screening tests can then be supplemented with more sensitive tests of specific areas of cognition.",

We propose a method to estimate one's understanding of conceptual knowledge, by keeping track of his/her learning activities. It overcomes some limitations of traditional methods, hence complements traditional methods.",

Mental illness influences beliefs, feelings, perceptions, behaviors, and motivations across time. It may interfere with one's ability to speak, to arrange one's thoughts, to know one's preferences. It may interfere with one's desire to eat, one's ability to find the energy to get up out of bed, one's will to make it through a day. Mental illness ultimately can shape one's development, personality, and capacities for love, self-knowledge, self-reflection, and societal contribution.

Clinicians have dual obligations to those they serve and to themselves. Personal and relational integrity are fundamental considerations for clinicians.

Intuitions develop about a subject matter through years of study, investigation, and problem solving, just as chess masters develop a sophisticated set of cognitive structures that change the very appearance of the chess board. In part because the subject matter is so personal, students new to personality and social psychology arrive with many intuitions, prior beliefs, and naive theories about social processes and behavior based on unsystematic experiences and observations. These intuitions can hinder or foster theoretical progress. The role of mentors, critiques, and empirical tests in minimizing the deleterious effects of these entry biases is discussed.

Comunicarse con eficacia o de manera asertiva es una clase de conducta susceptible de entrenamiento mediante procedimientos fundamentados en la Teoría del Aprendizaje Social. Como cualquier clase de conducta, consta de distintos componentes: cognitivos, emocionales y de comportamiento manifiesto (tanto verbal como no verbal), que deben ajustarse a una situación concreta para lograr su funcionalidad. Ello aumenta, a su vez, la probabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos planteados y de responder con certeza a las demandas propuestas, obteniéndose así una serie de ventajas, tanto personales como grupales y organizativas. Entre ellas, se puede destacar el alcanzar una mayor competencia social, autoestima, satisfacción personal, cohesión grupal, destreza para trabajar en equipo y una disminución de las tensiones y conflictos interpersonales y grupales. La obra que te dispones a ver, partiendo de un supuesto práctico como es la participación en una entrevista de selección de personal, pretende responder de una manera aplicada a las siguientes cuestiones: Qué son las habilidades sociales, para qué sirven, cómo se adquieren, qué clase o estilo de comunicación es más eficaz, qué técnicas son más ventajosas para su enseñanza y cómo puede beneficiar su aprendizaje. Esta obra es fruto de una larga experiencia en el desarrollo de programas de entrenamiento en habilidades sociales con y para distintos colectivos que deben afrontar situaciones difíciles y conflictivas, que requieren para su resolución el apoyo y la comunicación interpersonal y social. En su realización, no solo hemos puesto nuestro conocimiento del tema, difundido a través de monografías y artículos científico-técnicos, sino también la emoción que nos genera trabajar en un tema en el que creemos y sabemos puede ser útil para otras personas.

The predominance of individual psychological theory in professional training makes this bias unavoidable. Past training notwithstanding, it is inevitable that problems will emerge defying an adequate understanding using individual concepts. Many such problems occur at the group level. It is important that social workers be able to extend their thinking so problems can be understood at the group, as well as individual level. Group-level problems occur in all areas of professional life. Social workers spend their professional careers as members of groups. Agencies, community groups, work teams, committees, case conferences, educational groups, and social networks all exemplify unavoidable groups. Concurrently, social workers intervene with groups of clients. Regardless of the type and purpose of the group, problems at the group level will occur. This chapter explores empirical group-focused knowledge that can be used to understand and assess group-level problems.",

Discourse analysis, two illustrative cases, social construction theory and positioning are used to highlight some of the ethical dilemmas involved in basing a determination of capacity on the diagnosis of dementia and neuropsychological tests of cognitive function. Although neuropsychological tests have their place in assessing some aspects of cognitive function, aspects cognition such as meaning-making ability and selfhood cannot be assessed in a standard format. In dementia, there can be a differential impairment of recall memory while the personality, values and substantial long-term memory remain intact, as does implicit memory for recent events. People with dementia are vulnerable to being negatively positioned, thereby unfairly undermining their rights to make decisions about aspects of their lives. Assessing the capacity of a person with dementia to engage in decision-making is presently in need of examination so as to take into account the person's meaning-making ability and selfhood. Incorrect negative positioning, based on the diagnosis and defects in recall memory, can obscure intact cognitive abilities that allow a person to make decisions about aspects of living, creating the possibility of lasting harm being inflicted on the person with dementia.",

      "title": "Reflexive Methods of Knowledge in Educational Activities: Phenomenological Hermeneutics",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Knowledge is one of the most important human needs. Today, lifelong learning and self-education individual skills are of paramount importance for each representative of the society in relation to the world trends of a post-industrial era: economic domination in the innovative sector, progressive increase of intensity of information flows and rates of distribution of high technologies, rapid development of science and industry of knowledge, quickly changing and becoming tougher requirements to professionalism, qualification and creativity of experts irrespective of the sphere of employment. It is obvious that structural formation and improvement of ways of students’ thinking is one of the most important tasks of the educational system; reflection is of particular importance. However, the results of training are still defined by the level of development of easily measured operational skills and cognitive qualities (memory, attention, logic), in which the reflection is presented only partially. Reflexive abilities as the mechanism and instrument of knowledge, which assist a personality to understand himself or herself, to comprehend own feelings, actions, acts and complex external realities, in most cases remain unaccounted in educational process and when analysing and evaluating the results. The aim of the article was to justify the need to form reflexive skills of knowledge in students through a combination of phenomenological and hermeneutical methods in daily pedagogical practice. Methodology and research methods. The work is based on the ideas of anthropological and phenomenological approaches in human education and - above all - the philosophic idea of “human-sizedness”, which implies anthropological view on a student. The methods of system-based and comparative analysis, as well as the methods of interpretation, synthesis and modelling were used in the course of the research. Results and scientific novelty. The author designates classical linear and neoclassical types of informative models with corresponding to them essentially different explanatory-illustrative and actively-searchable methods, which are used by teachers during classes. The advantages of phenomenological pedagogics are proved: its central category is presented by the phenomenon - sense of any phenomena or processes, which leads to the enrichment of personal experience. In phenomenological approach, the student is regarded as a live, constantly changing character of own personal formation and development; knowledge process is considered as the sequence of acts of understanding and its judgment in close teacher-student interaction. The accumulation of knowledge experience and students’’ acquisition of axiological orientations are promoted by the reflexive processes, structuring knowledge conducive to the elaboration of individual strategy and tactics of behaviour. The educational practices, based on the ways of complete development of reflexive informative abilities of individuals in the context of their activity, are known as the anthropopractices, which subject is “human” in the person and the result is self-determination.The characteristics of two leading methods of knowledge - phenomenological and hermeneutical are compared, their similarity and distinction are shown, and possible options of application are shown. The author concludes that integrated usage of phenomenological approach with hermeneutics elements in the educational activity is considered useful. Practical significance. The means of phenomenological hermeneutics described in the article become especially relevant in the conditions of digitalisation and computerisation of pedagogical communication: their use better compensates for the costs of technical methods of training by the means of real teacher-student collaboration through dialogue, knowledge process, experience, interpretation and reflection of the discipline under study.",

      "abstract": "Musical education and development are connected with numerous challenges, such as great expectations, repertoire requirements, or consistent practice. At the same time, a destructive role of assessment, comparisons and expectations does not influence solely the effectiveness and quality of concerts, or auditions. Musicians experience various obstacles, including doubts, self-criticism, lack of self-confidence; they also experience anxiety and depression more frequently than the rest of the population. Going through such psychological hardships has an impact on their professional life and the quality of life in general. Over the course of music education, it is worth striving for the development of working methods regarding the prophylaxis of mental health and maintenance of mental well-being, which could be introduced as part of systemic programs offering psychological help. What may potentially be used here is a model of psychological flexibility, equipped with firm empirical foundations and covering processes that are tailor-made for the needs of the musical community. Formal and informal exercises in mindfulness, value recognition, or setting goals based on values, applied as part of work within the psychological flexibility model, result directly in, for instance, mindful, dedicated preparation and performances, as well as in enhanced self-confidence indirectly. For musicians this may be of a particular importance, as it has impact on better management of workload and preparations, despite experienced pressure of achieving perfection, on a higher quality of performance, enabling to experience ultimate and mindful performance, and first of all – on a sense of meaning and fulfillment.",

Hard working and ambitious, perfectionists are usually successful at any tasks they undertake. Their self-imposed high standards, self-discipline, and control usually ensure a high level of productivity and achievement. These personality features may lessen the likelihood of being exposed to and being overwhelmed by unexpected stressors. However, extreme manifestations of perfectionistic traits can result in indecisiveness or in behaviour patterns that are too rigid or controlling. For example, perfectionism may be displayed as a tendency to prevaricate on making the ‘right’ decision in a way that overshadows the more immediate demands of making a decision.",

As the pace of change is increasing and world of work is making ever greater demands on a person’s cognitive, emotional and physical resource. Since majority of the concerns in organization involve people in different roles, emotional intelligence has become a determining factor for their effective management. Social and personal competencies and skills such as problem solving, communication, collaboration, interpersonal skills, social skills and time management are actively being targeted by prospective employers as essential requirements for employability especially in team environments. Emotional Quotient describes a concept that involves the ability, capacity, skill or a self-perceived ability, to identify, assess, and manage the emotions of one’s self, of others, and of groups. The Emotional Quotient concept argues that IQ is too narrow; that there are wider areas of emotional intelligence that dictate and enable how successful we are. Researchers in diverse fields have studied emotional intelligence and found the construct to be associated with a variety of intrapersonal and interpersonal factors such as mental health, relationship satisfaction, and work performance. This article reviews research investigating the impact of training in emotional-intelligence skills and indicates that it is possible to increase emotional intelligence and that such training has the potential to lead to other positive outcomes. The paper offers suggestions about how future research, from diverse disciplines, can uncover training most effectively increase emotional intelligence and produce related beneficial outcomes.",

En cause : la non prise en compte de la double heterogeneite des troubles cognitifs et des plaintes des patients. L’alternative proposee a ces etudes consiste a travailler selon la methodologie des cas unique ou multiple en partant du pragmatisme des plaintes des patients, pour mettre en oeuvre des interventions centrees sur les activites specifiques de la vie quotidienne mettant en jeu les aspects fonctionnels alteres. L’objectif de cette these a ete d’etudier l’efficacite d’une telle demarche. Deux prises en charge individualisees et une prise en charge de groupe ont ete elaborees. Une premiere etude visait a optimiser la realisation des activites particulieres de la vie professionnelle du sujet a travers l’accroissement de l’efficacite de deux sous-composantes de la Memoire de Travail ; les deux autres etudes se sont focalisees sur les aspects executifs de la memoire episodique verbale et ont inclus une strategie organisationnelle de l’encodage visant a promouvoir les operations de comprehension et de structuration de l’information, dans le but d’optimiser la realisation d’activites de la vie quotidienne (lectures, conversations, sorties culturelles, suivi de programmes TV). Les resultats temoignent de l’efficacite et de la specificite de chacune de ces interventions. Un suivi a long terme a permis d’objectiver une stabilite dans le maintien des acquis et un transfert durable des differents apprentissages dans la vie professionnelle et quotidienne d’un des sujets.",

      "title": "THE CLASSIFICATION OF BARRIERS OF MASTERING THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE ACTIVITIES BY PROFILE SCHOOL PUPILS",
      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the problem of students’ barriers in learning foreign languages. The author stresses that the uniform classification of barriers do not exist as such, because every scientist studying a particular problem, underlines the presence of specific barriers, depending on the research subject. The author proves that it is appropriate to classify barriers to internal and external. Among the internal barriers they distinguish physiological, motivational, and emotional. Cognitive, communication, control, appreciation and proper speech barriers belong to external ones. Physiological barrier deals with the barrier of temperament that arises when the temperament of the teacher and the learner are opposite and this difference is not reflected. The motivational barrier is formed as a result of the lack of positive cognitive motivation of learning, the value of the profession. Emotional barriers include: actualization of negative traces of emotional memory when encountering a learning task, general unfavorable individual emotional background of activity, attraction. Organizational barriers are the result of poor organization of the learning process. The basis of information barriers lies in the improper structuring of educational information, the pace of its presentation, ignoring the laws of psychology of perception and the individual features of the cognitive, motivational, emotional spheres of the learner and his behavioral resources. Proper speech barriers include barriers to listening, speaking, reading and writing. Listening is accompanied by states of tension, panic, boredom, frustration, fear of failure, laziness, etc. Speaking a foreign language causes states of uncertainty, anxiety, fear of making a mistake. Usually reading does not cause acute problems, but working with the text, performing a number of tasks can be accompanied by laziness and boredom. Writing is accompanied by the fear to demonstrate ignorance of the subject in front of the teacher, inability to clearly and competently express thoughts in written form. Key words: classification, barrier, obstacle, the process of learning, foreign language.",

Individual case evaluation is a framework to quantify the effects of intervention on any single unit without separate comparison and control groups. From social work, psychology, sociology, education, psychiatry, biology, economics, history, and political science come field applications of individual-case evaluation. The fundamental bases of individual-case evaluation are therefore operationalized in every social work practice situation. The use of clinical-research procedures not differing from those of routine social work practice provides an impetus to individual-case evaluation though this correspondence neither masks nor otherwise distorts the nature of the approach. Social work with children who hurt themselves by self-mutilation or who physically calls for quick and uninterrupted intervention. Few social work situations are closed to individual-case evaluation. Social work roles of direct service, consultation, administration, and policy analysis are equally suited to individual-case evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research on the relation of well-being to personality, virtue and life experience is impeded by lack of agreement about the nature of well-being. Psychologists tend to reduce well-being to various subjective evaluations (e.g., life satisfaction or sense of meaning in life). Philosophers tend to reject these reductions but often do not agree among themselves. We believe most conceptions of well-being can agree that well-being involves success in one's personal projects and that personal projects should be a central construct for well-being assessments. Here we provide some initial evidence that traditional psychological approaches to well-being are commensurable with our personal projects approach, by demonstrating in a longitudinal sample that success in current personal projects predicts various forms of subjective well-being, even when controlling for past levels of well-being and project success.",

Objectives: To determine the influence of ethical dilemmas in the profession of the psychologist. Methodology: A documentary, cross- sectional, descriptive bibliographic investigation was carried out, through which information is collected from different databases such as: Scielo, Dialnet, Redalyc, Google Schollar, among others; to obtain results with the different types of analyzes performed in each of them, to obtain conclusions with a minimum margin of error, through a triangulation of data. Results: Professional ethics is closely related to morality, general principles and deontological rules, the place to develop a set of competencies, which are addressed, knowledge, skills and courage actions that guide the exercise, directions to elementary eminent judgments of effectiveness. Conclusion: The influence of ethical dilemmas in the profession of the psychologist represents a harmful state, therefore, negatively affects their professional practice, since the established ethical principles and moral norms are violated, thus ensuring that the rights of others are defenseless. It is for this reason, that one should keep in mind that a dilematic situation will depend so much on the behavior, discipline and integrity of the professional.",

It is formed and developed in the process of education. Cognitive activity is traditionally regarded as a special kind of mental activity. There are different components of cognitive activity and levels of its development. The higher the level of cognitive activity is, the more efficient the whole process of education is as knowledge is acquired more quickly and at a higher level. Cognitive independence combined with cognitive activity can radically improve the whole process of cognition. Thus, the task of an educational process is to activate cognition and develop cognitive independence by different methods and approaches.",

In conducting the evaluation, the examiner must carefully consider which developmental areas to assess and which measures to administer to best answer the referral question, provide accurate diagnosis, and inform treatment recommendations. Considerations and strategies are presented for cases in which specific needs or behaviors may necessitate changes to typical assessment choices and administration.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with dementia experience a variety of different symptoms, as all structures and functions of the brain are influenced, have increasing and multidimensional needs, tend to have low life quality, and to ‘lose themselves’ as the disorder progresses. Formal care and treatment of dementia aims at improving the life of the sufferers, yet often sets compartmentalized goals, and becomes impersonal and generic- thus less effective, despite the efforts. With these in mind, a holistic approach towards dementia arises. The goal is to enhance the self and improve life quality, while delaying the progression of the disorder. The self is seen as composed of a somatosensory, a cognitive, an emotional, a behavioral and a social aspect, along with psychological properties of the self (such as self- knowledge, or self- resilience). All these aspects are influenced by the disorder, thus are targeted through the intervention. The intervention follows the person-centered rational and uses all arts as a stimulus. It is composed of sessions with activities- each of which has a somatosensory, a cognitive, an emotional and a behavioral/social element, all of which are linked to the self and its properties. Previousresearch indicated the effectiveness of each element. The intervention was applied in ten case studies, with a qualitative and quantitative assessment (about the self, cognitive skills and life quality) occurring before and after. Results indicate that the intervention was efficient in enhancing the sense of self, delaying the progression of the disorder and improving life quality, and can be explained both through a neuroscientific and a psychotherapeutic perspective. Results imply that the self is a promising ‘target’ for a holistic approach (although more research is necessary), and can be applied both as a structured intervention, and as a rational of care and interaction, characterized by individualized approach and respect to the person’s uniqueness- their self.",

      "abstract": "The article presents the views of domestic and foreign scientists on the relationship of anxiety and intellectual activity. The interrelations and dependences of intellectual activity on the level of anxiety have been described. Anxiety is a subjective manifestation of the unfavorable interaction of the individual with the environment. The optimal level of anxiety can have a positive impact and help to mobilize activity and achieve the best result. The high level of anxiety will prevent the normal development of adaptive processes. Intelligence as a capacity is considered as an independent reality based on the criterion of behavior regulation. The method of internal organization of an integrated system of intelligence is a cross-functional communication of mental functions of different levels (memory, thinking, attention). If we consider intelligence as certain ability, it is necessary to talk about the adaptive value of intelligence for a human. High anxiety can prevent formation of adaptive behavior and lead to a disturbance of behavioral integration, reduce the possibility of self-actualization. High anxiety in children prevents effective schooling, reducing the ability to concentrate and mental performance, worsening the information reproduction and associative thinking. Anxiety can cause school neuroses, failure to adapt to a new situation, difficulties in intellectual activity, reduce mental performance, and cause difficulties in communication and establishing interpersonal relations with other people. Anxiety is a serious risk factor for the development of psychosomatic disorders and often causes stress. The results of the studies prove the data that high anxiety has a disruptive influence on the effectiveness of human intellectual activity. In this regard, the study of the anxiety nature and its impact on the intellectual and personal development of the child is of particular importance and relevance.",

Health care professionals, such as psychologists and sociologists, education institution administrators and teachers (among others) , are all, broadly speaking, supposed to be able to take responsibility for other people’s personal development. This makes the relative lack of attention given to theoretical foundations for knowledge on mental development and cognitive sciences all the more puzzling. This book focuses on an anthropological approach to mental illness, describing how schizophrenia can distort one’s experience of empathy and of the presence in the world through pathological indifference. It describes factual and phenomenological perspectives on a case of schizophrenia, based on the method of Eugène Minkowski.",

      "title": "Social Work Glossary: Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Mental health concerns itself with the operation of the mind including thoughts, emotions, affect and cognitions. As these are in themselves complex entities the way in which we understand mental health remains challenging. Mental health as a term is used broadly in professional practice, academic writing and popular media. It can be contrasted with other terms that have been used to understand the health of the mind, like mental illness which is deficit focused and medically orientated and the term mental disorder which in some settings provide a medical-legal definition. Additionally there are lay interpretations of the term mental health which are reflected in everyday beliefs, influenced by the media.  Terms such as ‘psycho,’ ‘barmy’ and ‘madness’ are examples of the everyday references to mental health within the public discourse. While lay definitions are often discriminatory and stigmatising they reveal the underlying opinions and attitudes that exist when mental health is talked about. These definitions should not be discounted as they reveal how everyday attitudes around mental health are informed by language, the media and personal experience.  The variety of ways of understanding the term mental health tells us that the term mental health is far from clear and does not hold a common shared meaning. The World Health Organisation considers that mental health is less defined by its deficit – mental illness/ mental disorder but is understood more positively. In its work the World Health Organisation notes that mental health and in particular mental distress is evident in all societies and in its attempt to provide a globally acceptable definition of mental health it highlights that the definition of mental health includes a “state of well being, being able to realise one’s own potential and is able to cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and make a contribution to his or her community” (WHO 2010 p6).  This definition positively avoids medical or legal terminology but does face some challenges like the practical application of well-being which can be subject individual interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Initiatives to promote well-being in student pharmacists are more crucial now than ever. A singular meaning of well-being is difficult to identify, as there are several interconnected factors that contribute, including physical, social, financial, career, and community factors.1 However, most would agree that well-being involves “the presence of positive emotions and moods, the absence of negative emotions, satisfaction with life, and fulfillment and positive functioning,” as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.2 Positive mental health envelops the psychological elements that comprise well-being. Conversely, poor well-being has been found to be associated with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.3 These conditions can have a negative impact on school or work performance, aspects of relations with friends and family, and one’s ability to participate in the community. Burnout and stress are also barriers to well-being and can lead to significant personal and professional concerns.4",

      "title": "Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is well established that many people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience significant problems with thinking skills such as concentration, memory, comprehension of social information, reasoning, and organization. These are often experienced by the individuals themselves as debilitating and demoralizing, but crucially, they also can limit people in their capacity to achieve fundamental life goals, such as working, having fulfilling relationships and living independently, which underpin well‐being and a satisfactory quality of life. Cognitive remediation for schizophrenia is a psychological therapy that aims to improve thinking skills and consequently to benefit other more general areas of functioning and improve quality of life. This entry will summarize the foundational research background to the development and effectiveness of cognitive remediation; and the cutting‐edge research into the developments in our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive change and its relationship to improvements in everyday functioning, and new applications for cognitive remediation. The key aims for the field of cognitive remediation are now (i) to optimize its effectiveness in improving cognitive skills, but critically, in a way that ensures that these cognitive improvements have a measurable impact on other more general life skills, and (ii) to facilitate the wider dissemination of cognitive remediation into the clinical community. To achieve these goals, we need to establish an evidence‐based, theoretical underpinning to cognitive remediation, including an understanding of the active ingredients and how best to deliver the therapy.",

      "abstract": "Psychological contract theory is a framework for understanding the expectations and obligations that exist between individuals and organizations. In the context of education, students have certain expectations about what they will receive from their education, such as high-quality instruction, a supportive learning environment, and opportunities for personal growth. Organizations, on the other hand, have certain expectations of their students, such as academic achievement, responsible behavior, and contributions to the campus community. When students' expectations are met, they are more likely to feel that their psychological contract has been fulfilled. This can lead to a number of positive outcomes, such as increased satisfaction with their education, improved academic performance, and stronger commitment to their institution. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It is a complex construct that includes a number of skills, such as self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills. There is a growing body of research that suggests that emotional intelligence is linked to a number of positive outcomes, such as academic success, job performance, and mental health. In the context of education, emotional intelligence can help students to cope with stress, manage difficult emotions, and build positive relationships with their teachers and peers.",

      "abstract": "The Internet has grown increasingly relevant in the practice of forensic psychiatry. To a psychiatrist conducting a forensic evaluation, the evaluee's Internet use can be relevant in nearly all aspects of the analysis. An evaluee's Internet presence may help to confirm, corroborate, refute, or elaborate on the psychiatrist's general impression of the person. Questions about the individual's choice of screen names, activities, images, and phrases can be valuable conversational tools to increase candor and self-disclosure, even among less cooperative evaluees. Difficulties in mood or affect regulation, problems with thought process or content, and impaired impulse control may be apparent in the evaluee's behavior in various Internet forums-for example, hostile or provocative behavior in social forums or excessive use of gaming or shopping websites. Discussions about the evaluee's behavior on the Internet can help the psychiatrist to assess for impaired insight and judgment. Perceptual disturbances, such as derealization and depersonalization, may be related to an evaluee's overidentification with the virtual world to the neglect of real-life needs and responsibilities. Furthermore, digital evidence can be especially useful in assessments of impairment, credibility, and dangerousness or risk, particularly when the evaluee is uncooperative or unreliable in the face-to-face psychiatric examination. This discussion will provide illustrative examples and suggestions for questions and topics the forensic psychiatrist may find helpful in conducting a thorough evaluation in this new age of the Internet.",

Qualitative Grounded Theory analysis was employed to study children assembling toys from pictorial instructions. The resulting model showed that usability problems can have a striking impact beyond just performance, affecting the user's self-efficacy, particularly among girls who tend to use internal attributions and equate difficulty with low ability. Without sufficient self-efficacy, the child will likely choose not to engage with assembly tasks and may regard him or herself as inadequately skilled in that area. Usability professionals should consider adding self-efficacy measures to provide more complete assessments.",

      "abstract": "Decision-making is an executive function, tapping into cognitive, emotional, and personality-based components. This complexity, and the varying operational definitions of the construct, is reflected in the rich array of behavioral decision-making tasks available for use in research and clinical settings. In many cases, these tasks are \"subfield-specific,\" with tasks developed by cognitive psychologists focusing on cognitive aspects of decision-making and tasks developed by clinical psychologists focusing on interactions between emotional and cognitive aspects. Critically, performance across different tasks does not consistently correlate, obfuscating the ability to compare scores between measures and detect changes over time. Differing theories as to what cognitive and/or emotional aspects affect decision-making likely contribute to this lack of consistency across measures. The low criterion-related validity among decision-making tasks and lack of consistent measurement of the construct presents challenges for emotion and decision-making scholars. In this perspective, we provide several recommendations for the field: (a) assess decision-making as a specific cognitive ability versus a taxonomy of cognitive abilities; (b) a renewed focus on convergent validity across tasks; (c) further assessment of test-retest reliability versus practice effects on tasks; and (d) reimagine future decision-making research to consider the research versus clinical implications. We discuss one example of decision-making research applied to clinical settings, acquired brain injury recovery, to demonstrate how some of these concerns and recommendations can affect the ability to track changes in decision-making across time.",

      "abstract": "The effect of \"emotional instability\" upon the measurement of intelligence is well known; the accurary of the measurement is impaired. Emotional factors strongly effect the \"fruitfulness\" and \"direction\" of the intelligence; but we still insist upon treating intelligence as a thing apart. Evidence is offered that intelligence is part of a total organic attitude involving also attitudes of mind, emotional conditions, ingrained habits, and conditioned behavior. In children of high-school age this total attitude is the essential factor in counseling and segregation. The greater the emotional contribution to the total attitude, the more subordinate is the intelligence. This attitude is a changing complex in response to situational factors. Transient situations may produce emotional disturbances reflected in lower results in mental testing at such times. The inequalities in mental tests from a given child are an index to his emotional capacity. The total organic attitude becomes more complex through the operation of a long-continued disturbing situation, possibly also through inherent characteristics of the individual reacting in extraordinary ways to temporary situations. Inasmuch as behavior grows out of this total attitude and decisions in domestic, educational, and vocational crises are dictated by it, the total attitude itself and the situational factors which produced it are the essential factors in counseling high-school children. Classes segregated according to these factors present more uniform teaching problems than classes segregated on the basis of intelligence tests alone.",

Considerable time and study have been devoted to the development of tests which would measure, in relatively pure form, primary mental functions, basic personality traits, differences in performance, preference, and interest. It is natural, then, that we should ask the following question. Can we meas ure specific factors associated with reading comprehension? Logical analysis and thoughtful speculation led many interested students of the reading process to describe reading comprehension in terms of several skills and functions. There seems to be wide agreement among them that reading comprehension can best be described in terms of multiple skills and abilities, rather than as a single or unitary function. Several fundamental questions are raised when we accept the multi-ability description of reading comprehension.",

Leisure activities are positive activities, identified psychologically by particular sets of behaviors and sociologically by their place in a leisure social world and often in a social institution (e.g. sport, art, entertainment). Leisure is defined and the concept of leisure experience examined. Next, the serious leisure perspective is introduced. The main part of the article explores the emotions of leisure experience in interpersonal relationships, contemplation/spirituality, volunteering, quality of life/well-being, happiness, and play and creativity.

      "abstract": "Intelligence can be defined as a general mental ability for reasoning, problem solving, and learning.Because of its general nature, intelligence integrates cognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, or planning.Exploring the relationships between human intelligence and the brain requires a careful consideration of the structure of human intelligence. 1Individual differences in intelligence (cognitive abilities) are a prominent aspect of human psychology, and play a substantial role in influencing important life outcomes. 2Studies suggests that larger brain predicts greater intelligence. 3In contrast to looking for a unique component of intelligence, the triarchic theory of intelligence defines it as comprising three components: the metacomponents, the performance components, and the knowledge-acquisition components.The metacomponents refer to the executive processes involved in problem solving, including mental manipulation and management.The performance components work as the carrier to implement the outcome of metacomponents, i.e., carrying out the actions.The knowledge-acquisition components are associated with the mental processes to obtain new information involving selectively dealing with relevant information and combining various pieces of information. 4An efficient way to improve cognitive performance is to (1) dissect an unstructured and chaotic problem/ goal into simpler sub-problems/sub-goals; and (2) only a sub-goal of behavior needs to be achieved in each attentional episode or each piece of cognitive segmentation.The essence of this strategy is to reduce the load of cognitive control for the coordination of thoughts and actions between attentional episodes.Even within each attentional episode, cognitive control is necessary to achieve subgoaldirected behavior.Therefore, this strategy of cognitive segmentation is consistent with our information theory account of cognitive control that is to reduce uncertainty. 5The relationship among intelligence, cognitive control, and working memory was examined using structural equation modeling.Results showed that cognitive control shared a large amount of variance with working memory and both measures were strongly associated with fluid intelligence Gf (Gf, concerning the ability to solve problems by abstraction) and crystalized intelligence (Gc, related to learning from prior knowledge and experience), with a stronger association with Gf than Gc.These findings suggest that cognitive control, serving as a core construct of executive functions, contributes substantially to general intellectual ability, especially fluid intelligence. 6",

      "title": "Exercising Your Mind: (Cognitive Psychology)",
      "abstract": "Traditionally, developmental psychology has been selective in the way it views our lives from cradle to grave. High on its priority list have been topics such as early childhood experience and learning, motivation, perception, intelligence, language and concept development, personality and socialization. From the point of view of sport, one topic is very notable by its absence from this list, motor development. That is not to say that the acquisition of motor skills has been ignored but too often physical accomplishments have been used as no more than developmental milestones, marking out what were seen as more psychologically significant developments in terms of cognitive, perceptual or social skills. Indeed it is only in the last few years that motor development has gained recognition as a valued and separate area within the subdiscipline, with a growing literature devoted solely to the topic (see Gabbard, 1992).",

Overinclusive definitions, such as the capacity/disability formulation, do not provide meaningful direction for defining need or assessing eligibility for insurance or other entitlements. Coping failures due to lack of skill, inadequate preparation, or other factors should be distinguished from those due to dysfunction or disturbance of psychological mechanisms. The capacity/disability formulation encourages confusion between different performance decrements and gives no guidance for appropriate boundaries for psychotherapy.",

      "title": "PERCEPTUAL LEARNING",
      "abstract": "▪ Abstract Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism's perceptual system that improve its ability to respond to its environment. Four mechanisms of perceptual learning are discussed: attention weighting, imprinting, differentiation, and unitization. By attention weighting, perception becomes adapted to tasks and environments by increasing the attention paid to important dimensions and features. By imprinting, receptors are developed that are specialized for stimuli or parts of stimuli. By differentiation, stimuli that were once indistinguishable become psychologically separated. By unitization, tasks that originally required detection of several parts are accomplished by detecting a single constructed unit representing a complex configuration. Research from cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, expert/novice differences, development, computer science, and cross-cultural differences is described that relates to these mechanisms. The locus, limits, and applications of perceptual learning are also discussed.",

      "title": "Contextual Dissociation Theory",
      "abstract": "Contextual Trauma Theory (CTT) proposes that dissociation is a basic mode of human functioning, not an anomalous, inherently pathological phenomenon. From this perspective dissociation comprises a spectrum of manifestations from highly adaptive to extremely problematic. Problematic dissociation related to complex trauma is understood not only as a response to traumatization, but also an expression of developmental deprivation: insufficient emotional support and cognitive stimulation by a child's caretakers resulting in restricted neuropsychological, psychological, and social maturation, manifested as functional deficits. Within this framework, a key aspect of problematic dissociation is severely limited capacities for sustained attention, and consequently for focal awareness of, and experiential connection to, one or more of three major spheres: the personal; the interpersonal; and the environmental. In contrast, adaptive dissociation reflects instances of detachment from awareness that promote effective functioning (e.g., screening out potential distractions to sustain concentration on a demanding task). Individuals exhibiting complex dissociation lack the capacity to sustain an attentive, focused, coherent state of consciousness that would allow them to maintain adaptive dissociation while electing not to have their awareness absorbed by dissociative symptoms. In contrast, with sufficient developmental attainment comes the ability to direct and modulate awareness, experientially connecting or disengaging as needed.",

The underlying problems of the psychopathic defective are essentially identical with those of the superior psychopaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe mental integrations described as intellectual simply give color and direction to the abundant energies with which all three patients have been endowed.

      "abstract": "Obtaining informed consent is a standard procedure in research practice. However, it is not sufficient, even if an individual chooses to participate voluntarily in research process, for the researchers to be able to claim that they have obtained informed consent. The consent must be of sufficiently ‘high quality’: it must not only be informed, but also valid, i.e., it must contain the following three elements: adequate information, voluntariness, and competence. Although preparing informed consent is a difficult process in general, it is particularly challenging when working with certain populations, such as clinical groups who have language and literacy difficulties, e.g., dyslexia. A lack of understanding of the basis and specific characteristics of this disorder can have negative effects on people with dyslexia (PwD) such as in the form of unwanted misunderstandings, psychological stress, negative effects on their learning processes, as well as unethical treatment in the research process. Studies have shown that PwD can be particularly vulnerable to research that might exploit, imply, or attribute unsafe practices to them and their difficulties, especially in connection with research recommendations that require written informed consent. Easy language refers to the language adaptation of a text to facilitate both reading and comprehension, particularly for PwD. Therefore, the use of the easy language guidelines for language adaptation and graphical adjustment is important when obtaining informed consent from PwD.",

      "abstract": "Executive Functioning (EF) refers to mental processes and skills required to organize the brain to act on information to reach a goal. Stated in another way, EF can be viewed as the managing system of the brain that coordinates all the activities our brainpower must accomplish. EF allows us to retain and work with a lot of information in our mind. It also helps us to filter distractions and switch from one topic or project to another. Specific skills of EF include: working memory, initiating and planning tasks and regulating behavior (impulse control, emotional control). Weak EF can occur in children with developmental disabilities (DD) and those without DD. EF dysfunction is viewed on a spectrum. Some children may have mild deficits; others may have more severe issues. Children may also have weakness in some skills and be proficient in others. EF dysfunction is not a diagnosis. It will, however, increase the difficulties of managing day-to-day activities and educational success for children/adolescents with this disorder. There is a dearth of literature on the incidence and prevalence of EF dysfunction. Even without specific statistics, special education and mental health experts are beginning to recognize the negative effect that weak EF has on a person’s academic and social abilities. Communities must become educated with issues associated with weak EF, in order to advocate for students’ needs. Learning strategies to improve students’ EF will enable children/adolescents/ students to reach their full potential as adults. This article will provide educational information and practical approaches for educators and healthcare professionals to assist families in managing EF in their children. Many of the strategies can be used in the schools and in the home to augment EF support. Adults needing EF enhancement may also find these same methods helpful.",

      "abstract": "Humans are well-known for being adept at using intuition and expertise in many situations. However, human experts are still susceptible to errors in judgment or execution, and failure to recognize the limits of knowledge. This would happen especially in semi-structured situations, in multi-disciplinary settings, under time or other stress, under uncertainty, or when knowledge is outdated Human errors are caused by cognitive biases, attentional slips/memory lapses, cultural motivations, and missing knowledge. The purpose of this research is to study errors of human experts committed in judgment and the general idea of critiquing systems as corresponding plan. Compared to expert systems, critiquing systems are narrowly focused programs useful in limited situations for collaborating with and supporting experts in their task activities. It supports an expert by detecting the human's errors by deploying various strategies that stimulate humans to improve their performance. A variety of types of critiquing systems has spread through numerous application areas.",

      "abstract": "Mandevillian intelligence is a specific form of collective intelligence in which individual cognitive vices (i.e., shortcomings, limitations, constraints and biases) are seen to play a positive functional role in yielding collective forms of cognitive success. The present paper introduces the concept of mandevillian intelligence and reviews a number of strands of empirical research that help to shed light on the phenomenon. The paper also attempts to highlight the value of the concept of mandevillian intelligence from a philosophical, scientific and engineering perspective. Inasmuch as we accept the notion of mandevillian intelligence, then it seems that the cognitive and epistemic value of a specific social or technological intervention will vary according to whether our attention is focused at the individual or collective level of analysis. This has a number of important implications for how we think about the design and evaluation of collective cognitive systems. For example, the notion of mandevillian intelligence forces us to take seriously the idea that the exploitation (or even the accentuation) of individual cognitive shortcomings could, in some situations, provide a productive route to collective forms of cognitive and epistemic success.",

      "abstract": "Solving a complex problem requires more than mere knowledge; it requires the motivation and personal resourcefulness to undertake the challenge and persist until a solution is reached. Classical theories of problem solving have emphasized the role of discovery or illumination as a primary motive to learn, but contemporary research has uncovered an array of highly predictive task- and performance-related motivational beliefs, such as self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intrinsic task interest, and learning goal orientations. Unlike trait motivational constructs, such as the need for achievement, these motivational beliefs change during the course of problem solving, and a complete account of their role must describe their interrelation with metacognitive and motor learning processes. Self-regulation models of learning and performance have integrated metacognitive, motoric, and motivational aspects of problem solving within a cyclical structure. We discuss how these task- and performance-related motivational beliefs instigate problem-solving efforts, and reciprocally how these beliefs are modified based on the outcomes of self-regulated solution efforts.",

Em relacao ao primeiro aspecto, muitos academicos recorrem ao suicidio como meio de escapar das suas angustias internas. Esses transtornos psiquicos podem ser exemplificados pela sindrome de Burnout, depressao, ansiedade, estresse relacionado ao meio academico. Entre os fatores externos e ambientais e importante salientar pressao social, apoio familiar, estigmatizacao, sobrecarga de responsabilidades, pressao excessiva do curso, mudanca de cidade e habitos e exaustao por atividades curriculares. A partir disso, percebe-se como consequencia o isolamento social dos academicos de medicina, podendo acarretar no desligamento do curso e a ideacao suicida que pode culminar na consumacao do ato extremo. A prevencao pode ser concretizada por meio de campanhas de conscientizacao e apoio psicologico nas universidades, com o intuito da promocao do bem-estar biopsicossocial do estudante. E importante salientar que esses projetos sejam implementados desde o primeiro periodo do curso, pois os academicos ja trazem consigo uma carga emocional negativamente afetada pelos processos seletivos para o ingresso na universidade. Foram selecionados 11 artigos para analises, a partir das quais demonstrou-se as categorias de discussao prevalentes: 90,90% das producoes literarias selecionadas abrangiam aspectos sociais e ambientais (pressao social, apoio familiar, estigmatizacao, sobrecarga de responsabilidades e tarefas, e pressao do curso); 63,63% aspectos e transtornos psicologicos que influenciam o risco de suicidio (estresse, depressao, ansiedade, medo e sindrome de Burnout) e somente 27,27% acerca de intervencoes e prevencao. Com relacao a categorizacao dos dados, constatou-se a ausencia de estudos de intervencao que retratem evidencias obtidas em observacoes individuais com delineamento experimental e evidencias de pesquisas quase-experimentais. Portanto, recomenda-se pesquisas acerca da problematica debatida, com a finalidade de levantar novos dados sobre esse cenario, levando em consideracao os altos indices de suicidios entre os estudantes de medicina e os fatores a eles relacionados. Dessa forma, busca-se o desenvolvimento de novos programas de suporte e apoio ao grupo academico, afim de que se reduzam as taxas de suicidio.Descritores: Medicina; Suicidio; Estudantes.",

It also affects the way of thinking, feeling, and situation handling of a person. A stable mental health helps in working with full potential in all stages of life from childhood to adulthood therefore it is of significant importance to find out the onset of the mental disease in order to maintain balance in life. The mental health problems are rising globally and constituting a burden on health-care systems. Early diagnosis can help the professionals in the treatment that may lead to complications if they remain untreated. The machine learning models are highly prevalent for medical data analysis, disease diagnosis, and psychiatric nosology. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This research addresses the challenge of detecting six major psychological disorders, namely, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Conversion Disorder, Depression, Mental Retardation, and Schizophrenia. These challenges are mined by applying decision level fusion of supervised machine learning algorithms. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> observations that we used for training and testing the models. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of a conflicting decision, a voting scheme Shrewd Probing Prediction Model (SPPM) is introduced to get output from ensemble model of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (RF+GBM). </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> The proposed model generated the Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)-based average accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 67% thus outperforming other machine learning models namely, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This research provides an intuitive solution for mental disorder analysis among different target class labels or groups. A framework is proposed for determining the mental health problem of patients using observations of medical experts. The framework consists of an ensemble model based on RF and GBM with a novel SPPM technique, namely SPPM (RF+GBM). This proposed decision level fusion approach significantly improves the performance in terms of Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score with 67%, 66%, and 67% respectively. This framework seems suitable in the case of huge and more diverse multi-class datasets. Furthermore, three vector spaces based on TF-IDF (unigram, bi-gram, and tri-gram) are also tested on the machine learning models and the proposed model. Experiments revealed that unigram performed better on the experimental dataset. In the future, more physiological parameters such as respiratory rate, ECG, and EEG signals can be included as features to improve accuracy. Also, the proposed framework can be tested on a wide range of mental illness categories by adding more mental illness diseases in the dataset which will result in an increase of class labels. </sec>",

This paper presents a framework that provides common users with tools to create interactive and adjustable digital artifacts for mobile devices. The artifacts can be adjusted to the users' needs, introducing different configurations regarding their look, interaction and behavior, providing support to various purposes by coping with and enhancing different procedures.

The article aims to reveal the essence and main aspects of psycho-cognitive human deprivation. Psycho-energetic and energetic-psycho-functional approaches were used. Within the framework of these approaches, the cognitive sphere through Psy-programs ensures the selection of information, and it is processing, the formation of the new mental, its transmission and use. Also, methods of analysis, synthesis, comparison and grouping were used. The essence of psycho-cognitive human deprivation was revealed, which is the stagnation or destructive process of the cognitive sphere of the psyche caused by either under-development, social immaturity or destruction of certain parameters of cognitive processes or lack, absence or unreliability of knowledge; psycho-sensitive, abstract-mental and mnemonic derivations as subspecies of psycho-cognitive deprivation; some features of the operational and functional activity of the cognitive sphere of the psyche of a deprived person are found out. Revealing the essence of psycho-cognitive deprivation and the definition of its main aspects will allow to develop the measures aimed, first, at its elimination and prevention; second, the development of the cognitive sphere and the full use of its resources; third, development of psy-programs using the resources of the unconscious, subconscious, conscious and superconscious in order to search for the latest knowledge, discoveries and inventions.",

      "title": "The power of focus: unlocking creative insight and overcoming performance barriers",
      "abstract": "Challenges, problems, and conflicts can be the seeds of growth, or the seeds of destruction. It seems worthwhile to develop skills for addressing and resolving life challenges in ways that promote growth. Problem solving skills are a component of any performance challenge whether athletic, academic, professional, or personal. However, the cognitive and physiological resources and processes associated with problem solving have the potential to act in ways that both enhance and inhibit effective problem solving and performance outcomes. The threat appraisal mechanism, the subconscious process of evaluating whether a challenge poses a threat, is designed to preserve the individual but can also work to interfere with an individual’s capacity for creative problem solving. Focus, a process capable of galvanizing an individual’s attention and energies toward a singular purpose, can erode performance just as powerfully by drawing energies away from performance goals. Insight into the interactions and interdependencies of underlying cognitive and physiological mechanisms and principles comprising the problem solving process would better inform the design of facilitative performance interventions for a variety of realms including business, academic, athletic, and interpersonal. The following experimental and quasi-experimental field study explored the relationship between cognitive appraisal, attentional focus, problem solving, and goal",

      "abstract": "The purpose of our article is to analyze psychological ways of the develop­ment of different types of thinking of students as their soft skills. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, generalization. The experimental method was the method of organizing empirical research. The results of the research. We proved, that a distinction had to be made between theoretical and practical thinking. Practical thinking has the aim to solve certain problems or transforming practical situations, and often exists in conditions of time shortage. Theoretical thinking acts as a process of cognition. Another dichotomous classification of thinking divides it into analytical, namely, that which unfolds in time, consists of different stages in the consciousness of the person who thinks, who is intuitive, who proceeds quickly, does not have clear stages and who is realized in a little degree. A distinction is also made by us between creative and reproductive thinking. We believe that mental culture implies a productive nature of thinking, which cannot exist outside the assimila­tion of reproductive procedures by a person, therefore, both types of thinking are important for the formation of a mental culture. All these characteristics of different types of thinking are so called soft skills, which are the basis of the development of students as future professionals. Conclusions. To learn a new subject and solve a problem facing a person, the subject’s creative thinking progresses through the implementation of many operations that are components of the thinking process. The following groups of thinking components are conventionally distinguished: thinking operations –&gt; analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, abstraction, concretization, clas­sification, systematization; thinking forms –&gt; concepts, judgments, inferences; thinking qualities –&gt; proveness, criticality, objectivity, laconicism, etc. We note that thinking cannot be reduced only to a system of intellectual operations. Occupying a central place in the structure of general intelligence, thinking and soft skills determine intelligence both procedurally and personally.",

      "title": "Comparative analysis of the level of adaptive behaviour according to place of residence of adults with moderate intellectual disabilities",
      "abstract": "Adaptive behaviour (AB) is a way of meeting personal requirements of natural and social surroundings. Rate of AB shows the level of which an individual is able to use the cognitive potential for adapting to the demands of everyday life. Persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) in the process of education are generally able to live a fairly independent life and work. However, they are never completely independent as they require different levels of management and support all of their lives. They follow the same legality in development as any other person; however, their development is slower and it shows deviations in the management of individual skills, habits, and developing abilities. Therefore, they manage to adapt their behaviour only to a certain degree. In an effort to make more objective assessment of the adapted behaviour, the intellectual ability of the individual was initially measured in the past which has not shown to be a sufficient criterion for the identification and classification of persons with ID. This has led to the development of measurement instruments for the determination of AB and consequently to the creation of numerous adapted behaviour scales. \r\nI assume in the thesis that the wards from the institution who receive a constant stimulus by the qualified staff show higher level of AB skills as wards in the domestic environment. My goal has been a comparative analysis of AB level according to the place of residence of adults with moderate ID. According to the place of residence, I divided the wards working at VDC between those living at home and those living within the institution. For the purpose of the research, I shaped an observation scale, based on existing AAMD and ABAS-II scales. It is divided into 7 areas which consist of total 117 claims with a 5-step scale from 0 to 4. It has been fulfilled by professional staff employed at VDC Toncka Hocevar. 27 adults with moderate ID, aged between 27 and 40 years, have been included in the comparison of those 14 wards from their domestic environment and 13 wards from the institution. By comparing both samples by areas I have found out that there is no statistically significant difference between the samples of wards from the domestic environment and the wards from the institution. The biggest differences are in the area of functional academic skills and there are none in the area of communication and work; elsewhere deviations are insignificant. With a properly designed scale and a comprehensive research the most critical areas and major differences of existing VDC could be assessed.",

      "abstract": "The way of life and work is transforming rapidly in the 21st century due to various reasons, specifically due to the technological advancement. As a result the skills to be acquired by a person are also transforming. Skill is nothing but the expertise to perform a task. NEP 2020 stresses on certain skills which can be grouped in to three main categories namely learning skills, literacy skills and life skills. NEP recognizes the importance of these skills and lays out a comprehensive framework for their development. In today’s complex life we come across different situations which essentially need certain life skills along with learning skills and literacy skills. The concept of life skill is referred as psychosocial competency, as it is psychological in nature and comprise of thinking and behavioral processes. The major classification of life skills includes thinking skills, personal skills or emotional skills and social skills. Thinking skills include self awareness, critical thinking, decision making, creative thinking etc. Personal skills include emotional intelligence, resilience, coping with stress etc. Social skills include interpersonal relationship, effective communication, empathy etc. As our education system becomes more technology based and mechanical, it is the need of the time to create proper environment for the development of different life skills in our new generation. This paper tries to discuss life skills and its importance in connection with NEP 2020, need of life skill development and measures to be adopted for the development of life skills in students through the process of education.",

      "title": "Plasticity in healthy old age : a multi-domain training approach",
      "abstract": "Aging has an impact on people’s social, cognitive, and physical functioning. Despite great individual variability, healthy aging occurs along with declines in the maximal performance of several cognitive abilities including spatial navigation and memory, visuomotor skills, and executive functions, while other abilities are spared or even improve. An increasing number of older adults fears age-related losses that affect quality of life and independent functioning. Therefore, maintaining cognitive abilities is of interest from both an individual’s perspective and from a societal one since the demographic change leads to the need of keeping older adults in the workplace.\r\nPlasticity refers to the malleability of cognitive and neural functioning. This malleability is preserved across the adult lifespan until very old age and is known to be exploited by training. Considerable scientific effort has been put into finding effective interventions to improve and stabilize cognitive and brain functioning during aging. However, evidence for domain-general and long-lasting improvements has been sparse, and the mechanisms of cognitive training are not well understood. The present thesis focuses on multi-domain training, a training approach that combines exercising cognitive, physical, and social abilities. Thus, it has the potential to increase each trained domain as well as the ability to orchestrate multiple domains.\r\nFirst, available multi-domain training studies are reviewed. This literature review concludes that previous multi-domain training approaches have not been significantly informative regarding the impact of a particular type of multi-domain training on transfer. To fill this gap, a novel training tool has been developed.\r\nThis novel training tool, called “Hotel Plastisse”, is introduced secondly. “Hotel Plastisse” is an iPad-based training specifically designed to compare the simultaneous training of three cognitive functions (multi-domain training) to the training of each single cognitive function (single-domain training). The trained domains are clearly defined and separable from each other. Thereby, training-related improvements can be related to transfer in a theoretically informed way. Furthermore, the training environment is designed as a motivating learning environment in a virtual hotel, incorporating an adaptive difficulty algorithm and providing detailed feedback. These are design aspects that are increasingly recognized as critical in the training literature.\r\nThird, a cognitive training study examines near and far transfer of single-domain and multi-domain training. Eighty-four healthy older participants aged 64 to 75 years trained either inhibition, visuomotor function, or spatial navigation (single-domain training groups), or the simultaneous combination of these three functions (multi-domain training group). With respect to near transfer, the single-domain and the multi-domain training groups did not differ. With respect to far transfer, improvements on attentional control were more pronounced in the multi- domain training group than in the single-domain training group. Furthermore, independent of training group, individuals with lower baseline performance showed higher training-related change on the transfer test battery compared to individuals with higher baseline performance. Six months after training, training-related improvements remained stable. The findings show that multi-domain training enhances functions that involve handling several different tasks at the same time, which is an everyday challenge especially for older people.\r\nFourth, functional brain network characteristics are compared between three groups of participants that differed with respect to their training history (multi-domain training group, visuomotor function training group, participants with no training history). One year after training, participants underwent high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) measurement to examine expertise-related functional connectivity and small-world network characteristics during performance on the multi-domain training task. The multi-domain training group performed significantly better than the visuomotor function training group and the control group (no training history). In addition, the multi-domain training group showed enhanced and\r\nmore efficient functional connectivity in a task-related network encompassing visual, motor, executive, and memory-associated brain areas. Hence, the findings show expertise-dependent differences in performance and neural network characteristics even a year after training.\r\nTaken together, the thesis presents evidence for cognitive and neural plasticity in healthy older adults induced by a simultaneous multi-domain training. Training regimes that target older adults’ ability to handle several tasks simultaneously may enhance the probability for an overlap with different situations. Future studies should take methodological approaches that allow researchers to relate inter-individual differences to training progress and transfer. In addition, neuroimaging will lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological bases of plasticity. Well-informed experimental paradigms combined with sophisticated behavioral and neuroimaging data analyses will provide further insights into the mechanisms of training- induced plastic changes in healthy aging, and will thereby advance the development of effective interventions.",

The social clinical determination, by delimiting the development structure: stages of intellectual development (Piaget); psycho-motor development (Gesell); affective development (Freud); moral development (Colbert). 3. The formative determination, which captures the learning capacity, without expecting that a certain manifestation to take place, but trying to capture and evaluate the individual potentiality (the proximal development area). Findings: The development factors are: genetic (phenotypic maturation), stimuli adequacy, on time apparition, the filtering function in sensitive people, the elasticity of the personality system. The influence of the environment is a condition for forming and learning. Starting from the procedure of acquiring information, we can make an analytical description of the construction of intellect sides - the capacities to: dissociate, abstract, generalize, understand, transfer, argument, classify. Conclusions: The traits described before match a certain dimension of the personality which is intelligence.",

      "title": "Cognitive Development in Adulthood",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term, “cognitive aging,” is typically used to refer to the area of developmental psychology focusing on the study of cognitive changes from young adulthood to very late life. Among the developmental processes of interest are those that reflect cognitive functioning, such as intelligence, memory, and reasoning. An underlying assumption is that cognition is used in different ways to accomplish different goals throughout adulthood, but that it is always a central component of one's concept of self—past, present, and future—and one's adjustment to challenges of everyday life. This area of lifespan developmental research is a particularly active one, in that it is at the crossroads of both classic theoretical questions and important issues of individual and social application. In this chapter, we summarize selected leading issues in the field of cognitive aging. These include: (1) intelligence and patterns of intellectual aging, (2) differential profiles associated with the “aging” of various systems of memory, (3) new topics in such memory‐related domains as metamemory and social‐interactive memory, and (4) emerging research in such novel domains as wisdom, creativity, compensation, and plasticity. We conclude that, because cognitive aging involves developmental processes that range from the neurological through the individual to the social levels of analyses, it will continue for the foreseeable future to fascinate scholars and anyone else who is curious about how and why cognitive changes occur throughout adulthood.",

      "title": "How selves differ within and across cognitive domains: self-prioritisation, self-concept, and psychiatric traits",
      "abstract": "How we build and maintain representations of ourselves involves both explicit features which are consciously accessible on reflection and implicit processes which are not, such as attentional biases. Understanding relations between different ways of measuring self-cognition both within and across such cognitive domains is important for understanding how selves may differ from one another, and whether self-cognition is best understood as largely uni-dimensional or more multi-dimensional. Further, uncovering this structure should inform research around how self-cognition relates to psychiatric and psychological conditions. This study explores the relations between different constructs of self-cognition and how variability within them relates to psychiatric traits. Our final dataset includes within-subject (n = 288, general population) measures of explicit self-concept (using both the Self Concept Clarity Scale and Self Concept and Identity Measure), implicit self-prioritisation in a shape-label matching task (for both reaction time and sensitivity) and measurement of traits for five psychiatric conditions (autism, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety). We first test whether self-cognitive measures within and across domains are correlated within individuals. We then test whether these dimensions of self-cognition support a binary distinction between psychiatric conditions that either are or are not characterised in terms of self, or whether they support self-cognition as transdiagnostically predictive of the traits associated with psychiatric conditions. To do this we run a series of planned correlations, regressions, and direct correlation comparison statistics. Results show that implicit self-prioritisation measures were not correlated with the explicit self-concept measures nor the psychiatric trait measures. In contrast, all the psychiatric traits scores were predicted, to varying degrees, by poorer explicit self-concept quality. Specifically, borderline personality disorder traits were significantly more strongly associated with composite explicit self-concept measures than any of depression, anxiety, or autism traits scores were. Our results suggest that selves can differ considerably, along different cognitive dimensions. Further, our results show that self-cognition may be a promising feature to include in future dimensional characterisations of psychiatric conditions, but care should be taken to choose relevant self-cognitive domains.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this article is to explore some of the ethical issues surrounding the assessment and determination of capacity of people with dementia in light of their meaning-making ability as shown through discourse. Discourse analysis, two illustrative cases, social construction theory and positioning are used to highlight some of the ethical dilemmas involved in basing a determination of capacity on the diagnosis of dementia and neuropsychological tests of cognitive function. Although neuropsychological tests have their place in assessing some aspects of cognitive function, aspects cognition such as meaning-making ability and selfhood cannot be assessed in a standard format. In dementia, there can be a differential impairment of recall memory while the personality, values and substantial long-term memory remain intact, as does implicit memory for recent events. People with dementia are vulnerable to being negatively positioned, thereby unfairly undermining their rights to make decisions about aspects of their lives. Assessing the capacity of a person with dementia to engage in decision-making is presently in need of examination so as to take into account the person's meaning-making ability and selfhood. Incorrect negative positioning, based on the diagnosis and defects in recall memory, can obscure intact cognitive abilities that allow a person to make decisions about aspects of living, creating the possibility of lasting harm being inflicted on the person with dementia.",

      "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendapatkan gambaran mengenai self efficacy pada remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa. Masa transisi dari remaja menuju dewasa merupakan proses yang sangat penting dalam perjalanan hidup seorang individu. Beberapa aspek yang dihadapi remaja pada masa ini antara lain mengembangkan keterampilan serta kompetensi yang diperlukan untuk mencapai kemandirian. Remaja dengan disabilitas daksa pun memiliki kebutuhan yang sama dengan rekan-rekan mereka yang tidak mengalami disabilitas. Namun kondisi keterbatasan fisik dapat menimbulkan permasalahan lain pada individu yang mengalaminya. Hambatan pribadi seperti harapan yang rendah akan kemampuan diri dapat menjadi permasalahan bagi mereka dalam melewati masa transisi tersebut. Salah satu upaya yang dilakukan oleh pemerintah untuk membekali remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa dengan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan dalam dunia kerja adalah melalui pemberian pelatihan keterampilan/vokasional. Menurut teori Kognitif Sosial, bagaimana orang berperilaku terkadang lebih baik diprediksi dari keyakinan mereka atas kemampuannya daripada kemampuan mereka yang sebenarnya, yang selanjutnya disebut sebagai self efficacy. Istilah self efficacy mengacu pada keyakinan individu akan kemampuannya untuk dapat menghadapi situasi atau menyelesaikan tugas secara efektif. Tingkat self efficacy remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa dalam mengikuti kegiatan pelatihan akan mempengaruhi seberapa besar usaha yang ia keluarkan dalam mengikuti program pelatihan, apakah ia mampu mempertahankan sikap positif terhadap tujuan pelatihan, serta ketekunannya meskipun menghadapi kesulitan. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskriptif kuantitatif untuk mendapatkan gambaran mengenai self efficacy pada remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa yang mengikuti pelatihan keterampilan di salah satu lembaga dengan sampel sebanyak 65 orang. Pengambilan data dilakukan dengan menggunakan kuesioner yang disusun berdasarkan teori self efficacy dari Bandura (1977), yang meliputi tiga aspek self efficacy : level, strength, dan generality. Data dianalisis dengan menggunakan statistik deskriptif (distribusi frekuensi). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa sebanyak 55,4% responden memiliki self efficacy yang tinggi. Sementara sebagian lainnya masih menunjukkan keraguan atas kemampuan yang mereka miliki. Rendahnya tingkat keyakinan akan kemampuan diri dapat menghambat pengembangan keterampilan yang dibutuhkan dan mempengaruhi kegigihan seseorang ketika menghadapi tugas yang sulit. Berdasarkan kondisi tersebut, selanjutnya peneliti merancang suatu program intervensi untuk membantu mereka meningkatkan self efficacy-nya.",

Especially in closed environments, it is practiced as a form of occupational therapy (ergotherapy), because it ensures a sense of usefulness, helping to maintain somato-psycho-emotional health. The schoolmasters highlight the formative values of work for students: evaluate the native skills and abilities, lead to the discovery of new unknown interests and talents, support the student in his perfection by inoculating the ideas of responsibility, order, discipline, etc. Before 1989, in detention environment labour was mandatory, but now, labour is an optional right. The two perspectives are diametrically opposed, and the issue was addressed only from the perspective of reduced job supply, both during detention and after release. There are few publications with strict reference to this topic. In general, the social reintegration of post-execution prisoners is addressed. At this moment, the main problem highlighted is integration/reintegration on the labour market, as the main facilitating step of maintaining the accumulations during the detention period and a primary factor for avoiding the recurrence. However, those who have served a custodial sentence do not have a \"ticket\" to the labour market. To be known and solved, the situation should be addressed continuously: prevention before detention, education/re-education/training / retraining during detention and placement on the labor market / retraining immediately after release.",

      "title": "The Evaluation of the Major Characteristics and Aspects of the Procrastination in the Framework of Psychological Counseling and Guidance.",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is important to understand causes and consequences of procrastination that is appeared common among general and academic population. Procrastination affects people in various domains of life such as academic, professional, social relationships, and finance management. A person with high procrastination may lose his/her work, drop out from school, or may endanger his/her marital life. Similarly, High procrastinators might increasingly experience psychological distress related to lack of sense of personal control, self-worth and lack of sense of self-perceived personal ability as deadlines approach. The purpose of this study presents theoretical and conceptual frames of procrastination that is an important variable of individual difference and common in general and academic population. Key Words Procrastination, Conceptual Framework, Psychological Counseling. Procrastination is a phenomenon in which a person neglects to attend to a necessary responsibility, such as a task or decision, in a timely fashion, often despite their good intentions or inevitable negative and unpleasant consequences. It is not unusual for people to procrastinate occasionally, but for some, procrastination is a chronic problem that causes considerable psychological discomfort and distress. Procrastination is especially common in the general and academic populations. Ellis and Knaus (1977) point out that 95% of American college students procrastinate. In Solomon and Rothblum's (1984) survey, 46% of students reported that they procrastinate on academic tasks at least half of the time. Harriott and Ferrari (1996) refer to procrastination as one of the least understood minor human miseries, affecting 15-25% of the population during their lifetime. Procrastination is pervasive, affecting many facets of life. Milgram, Batori, and Mowrer (1993) identify five categories of procrastination; (i) life routine procrastination, (ii) decisional procrastination, (iii) neurotic procrastination, (iv) compulsive procrastination, and (v) academic procrastination. Each theory related procrastination tends to address one side of procrastination problem and not the others. For example, behavioral perspective used to in the reinforcement theory has been the prevailing explanation of procrastination under the behavioral paradigm. According to the tenets of behaviorism, procrastination can be explained in terms of incentives students have for off work and the absence of incentives for effort that contributes to goal attainment (Briody, 1980). Within the psychology literature, earliest theories of procrastination came from the psychodynamic tradition, a school of psychology that emphasizes childhood experiences as an influential factor in adult personality, unconscious mental process as influences on everyday behavior, and internal conflict as an underlying root of most behavior (Matlin, 1995). As such, psychodynamic literature primarily characterizes procrastination as a problematic behavioral manifestation of underlying internal psychic drama, often involving feelings about and towards one's family. Based on their extensive clinical experience working with procrastinators, Ellis and Knaus (1977) emphasized that the irrational nature of procrastination and the ability of the procrastinators to actively identify, dispute and restructure their irrational beliefs, self defeating cognitions to bring about desired behavioral and emotional chances. Although they have defined procrastination in technical sense as putting off something until a future time-postponing or deferring action on something you have decided to do( p.7). Ellis and Knaus (1977) characterized procrastination as resulting from three basic and, often overlapping causes: self- downing (negative and disparaging self talk), low frustration tolerance, and hostility. These three causes are viewed as manifestations of a cognitive style that involves unrealistic views about the self, others and the world. …",

      "title": "Motivation is produced in contexts",
      "abstract": "Various theories on motivation highlight specific dichotomised dimensions such as performance/learning, intrinsic/extrinsic, academic/social and so on. The five motivational orientations are developed on the basis of the young people's narratives about their motivation regarding school and learning and existing research literature and knowledge about what is central for young people's motivation. The five motivational orientations are: Knowledge motivation, mastery motivation, involvement motivation, performance motivation and, finally, relational motivation. Knowledge motivation is, thus, about reaching beyond them and being curious about the outside world; expanding their horizons and then trying to link knowledge to their own world. Even though some pupils have a strong orientation towards school and knowledge, there are also numerous examples of pupils who find it difficult to connect to different subjects or see the point of the knowledge they are supposed to acquire. One challenge is that the learning perspective in some of the more open and playful learning processes disappears for the students.",

      "abstract": "Deficits in social skills and social competence play a significant role in the development and maintenance of many emotional and behavioural disorders of childhood and adolescence. Social skills training (SST) aims to increase the ability to perform key social behaviours that are important in achieving success in social situations. Behavioural SST methods include instructions, modelling, behaviour rehearsal, feedback and reinforcement, frequently used in association with interpersonal problem solving and social perception skills training. Effective change in social behaviour also requires interventions that reduce inhibiting and competing behaviours, such as cognitive restructuring, self‐ and emotional‐regulation methods and contingency management. Research suggests that SST alone is unlikely to produce significant and lasting change in psychopathology or global indicators of social competence. Rather, SST has become a widely accepted component of multi‐method approaches to the treatment of many emotional, behavioural and developmental disorders.",

      "title": "THE ATTRIBUTES OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS IMPACT ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is a debate of whether Emotional Intelligence is born or made when it comes to the field of higher education and students ‘academic performance The question that arises is: whether students should build on their practical and analytical knowledge transferred by theory only or they should acquire more Emotional Intelligence skills? The new paradigm of thinking encompasses creative and Emotional Intelligence as essential building blocks in most organisations. The current competitive environment implies on students to perform multiple tasks with efficiency and effectiveness, their academic knowledge and theory only will not help facing challenges but their right attitude and Emotional Intelligence towards circumstances will definitely be the added value needed for them to face complexities of life. These skills help to lead with impact for a future generation able to combine the Intellectual intelligence (IQ), inherited capacity which enables cognitive skills to be learned and the Emotional Intelligence (EI) not only as a concept or theory learned but as an agile tool applied for leveraging the standards of academic achievement. EI is a supplement in this sense to both Analytical and Practical intelligence. The underlying assumption of this research in hand is advocating that if academic performance deals with ambiguity and challenge, therefore Emotional Intelligence -whether inherited traits or acquired skills- is needed for a student to excel academically. On the academic level, this paper aims at identifying the effect of Emotional Intelligence on students’ academic performance in British education system. It will enable further and wider research in the field of education to deliver more findings on a more comparative scale. The information might be of interest to elaborate on more private as well as public higher education institutions as the survey will only include students from the Business department in the BAEPS faculty at the British university in Egypt. On the practical level, in the wave of Educational reform in Egypt and under the umbrella of 2030 strategy it is crucial to run such study to clarify the impact of EI on the quality of academic achievement for students and to encourage all educational institutions to enhance these skills to increase their students’ academic performance. The research could be upgraded to be applied on the business sector institutions in the field of business in general as today organisations are looking for employees – who are the future graduate students- who have the necessary knowledge as well as skills to deal with challenging situations.

The concept of self is an inevitable consequence of recursive social reasoning, but it is bound to cause logical paradox due to its self-reference. Broadly speaking, self is an example of metacognition, namely, a consequence of cognition applied to evaluate other cognitive processes, which includes the feeling of knowing and other abilities to select the optimal decision-making strategies. As the number and complexity of different learning strategies increase, this also produces undesirable side effects, including negative emotions, such as disappointment and regret, as well as potential failures of metacognition, which might manifest as mental illnesses.",

      "title": "Towards a balanced social psychology: Causes, consequences, and cures for the problem-seeking approach to social behavior and cognition",
      "abstract": "Mainstream social psychology focuses on how people characteristically violate norms of action through social misbehaviors such as conformity with false majority judgments, destructive obedience, and failures to help those in need. Likewise, they are seen to violate norms of reasoning through cognitive errors such as misuse of social information, self-enhancement, and an over-readiness to attribute dispositional characteristics. The causes of this negative research emphasis include the apparent informativeness of norm violation, the status of good behavior and judgment as unconfirmable null hypotheses, and the allure of counter-intuitive findings. The shortcomings of this orientation include frequently erroneous imputations of error, findings of mutually contradictory errors, incoherent interpretations of error, an inability to explain the sources of behavioral or cognitive achievement, and the inhibition of generalized theory. Possible remedies include increased attention to the complete range of behavior and judgmental accomplishment, analytic reforms emphasizing effect sizes and Bayesian inference, and a theoretical paradigm able to account for both the sources of accomplishment and of error. A more balanced social psychology would yield not only a more positive view of human nature, but also an improved understanding of the bases of good behavior and accurate judgment, coherent explanations of occasional lapses, and theoretically grounded suggestions for improvement.",

      "abstract": "The influence of complex cognitive processes on the decision-making is an extremely important factor in the field of emergency medicine, as it is closely related to the environmental, cultural and functional characteristics of the system. The article analyses the group, organisational and emotive aspects that interfere with the effectiveness of emergency staff, the role of intuition in analytical operating models, and the interrelations with the areas (cortical and subcortical) of the brain involved in decisional conflict situations. There are members of the emergency teams who are the organisers of the process, and who monitor it; they share the difficulty to act, as well as procedures, and guarantee the &ldquo;local knowledge&rdquo;, which often deals with limited information, emergencies and unexpected events in the clinic. The various professional roles involved in the decision-making process itself use diagnostic instruments and personal experience, which often makes use of a psychic function, namely, intuition. Intuition is an unconscious process that allows access to a large number of models, information, and data learnt and stored in the long-term memory, without the need for any clear conscious cognitive effort. In this context, the characteristics of intuition and its function and reliability are investigated, as are the value of heuristics in making decisions and its role in different cognitive styles. Improving the outcomes of the decision-making process and the levels of safety in an emergency requires shared rules and operating procedures, knowledge of the situation, awareness of the human tendency to make cognitive and emotional distortions, and an ability to blend, safely, intuitive cognitive and analytical styles, depending on the task at hand.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of cognitive capacity to make important decisions or perform activities of daily living is an important professional responsibility for many neuropsychologists who evaluate older adults. Use of a conceptual framework for the assessment of decisional capacity can facilitate neuropsychological assessment of the four fundamental cognitive abilities that are involved in decisional capacity: understanding, appreciation, reasoning or formulating, and communicating a choice. Such capacity assessments are often part of a broader neuropsychological evaluation. The goal of this chapter is to provide neuropsychologists pragmatic guidance for capacity assessments, including a conceptual approach, an understanding of cognitive and functional issues, and information about assessment tools and report writing. Although neuropsychologists are asked to address a variety of capacity-related questions, this chapter focuses on the capacity to make medical decisions and the capacity to manage finances. The assessment processes illustrated for these decisions and abilities can be applied to other questions of capacity. Effective clinicians perform appropriate evaluations and arrive at sound decisions that balance respect for the examinee's autonomy with preservation of their safety and wellbeing.",

The language of inquiring systems is employed to describe differences in the conditions under which a problem can be considered solved. Differences in inquiring systems are outlined along the dimensions of the decision theory and structure terminology defined above. Formal operations and other well-structured problem-solving skills are compared to post-adolescent cognitive development, which deals with the ability to solve ill-structured problems.

In the present article the method of diagnostics and the analysis of loneliness as life situation is offered. The inventory \"Assessment of situational activity of the adult personality (ASA)\" allows to correlate primary categorization of a life situation – her assessment as daily, significant or difficult and type of behavioral strategy – adaptive, active and adaptive, coping-activity and hipercoping-activity (the allocated E.A. Belan special type of activity, an extreme form of mastering the expressed imbalance of personal and situational determination of activity); and also to diagnose 4 components of situational activity of the personality: physiological, mental, behavioral and reflexive. In total they make individual and estimated model of a situation. The fact of experience in itself of loneliness as life situation is less informative for understanding of individually special processes of activity of the personality especially as for the observer they are hidden in individual consciousness and aren't always distinctly realized by the personality. Meanwhile, primary categorization of a situation of loneliness, namely, perception by her personality as daily, significant or difficult, exerts impact on subjective characteristics of experience of loneliness. However the direct behavioral strategy of the personality in a situation of loneliness isn't interconnected with subjective characteristics of experience of loneliness that contradicts logic of situational activity of the personality. Given a contradiction causes need of accounting of individual and estimated model of a situation for the analysis of genesis of situational activity of the personality for a loneliness situation. It is shown that characteristics of individual and estimated model of a situation influence experiences and psychological states of the personality who is in this situation, ambiguously. The practice focused conclusions which can set the direction of psychological escort of the personality in situations of experience of loneliness are presented.",

      "title": "The principle of employability as a fundamental tool for managing people with disabilities and/or vulnerabilities",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Employability is a set of conditions—skills, understanding, and personal attributes (including physical and mental health)—that make individuals more likely to perform a particular job and succeed in their assigned occupations, benefiting themselves, their coworkers, the community, and the business and social economy.Disability refers to a person who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and medium- to long-term negative effect on their ability to perform normal daily activities, including work.The aim of those involved in employability management is to ensure its applicability to people with disabilities as defined by the social security system or by the work suitability requirements/restrictions formulated by occupational physicians. This objective must be achieved through a road map of practical and feasible solutions to enable all workers to be truly included in the work process, ensuring well-being and productivity.Objectives. Anyone with physical, mental, and/or cognitive limitations or who is otherwise diverse (including personal characteristics of the workforce such as age, sex, gender identity, and ethnic origin) must be allowed to work safely and productively by reducing occupational risks and eliminating the obstacles that stand in the way of this project.The objective should be achieved by designing and implementing workstations that comply with threshold limits for physical work, cognitive and mental demands, and by early detection of physical and mental functional deficits in work capacity.The first step is a proactive preventive approach to avoid having people with limitations and/or disabilities as a result of work activity. The second step is reactive and positive management of workers with disabilities/prescriptions and work fitness limitations.In fact, not all workers can achieve the same productivity as a person without a disability or impairment, even with technical or organizational ergonomic measures, due to the high level of disability. These workers must also be included in the employability management process.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted in New York on December 13, 2006, uses “reasonable accommodation” as a synonym for employability. Reasonable accommodation consists of “necessary and appropriate modifications and adjustments” to ensure “the right to work of persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others.” . The United Nations' goal is to have “decent work” for all people.The principles established by the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on April 11, 2013, can be extended globally and to the extent of “reasonable accommodation”/ employability and could be applied, taking into account local legislation, not only to those who are recognized as disabled and handicapped by specific public bodies in accordance with the legislation of each country, but also to any worker suffering from a condition that compromises their full fitness for work, regardless of whether the disability is certified. Disability should not be assessed solely on the basis of the diagnosis of diseases, but by considering the overall residual functional capacity of each person and using standardized and validated questionnaires such as the ICF short version.Results. There are several critical issues to be addressed in order to achieve a common global approach to managing employability:Different legislation in different countries Resistance to accepting workers with severe disabilities or prescriptions/limitations that significantly limit their fitness for work (even if only in the short term) Different approaches are used in different countries for risk assessment.Different tools are used to assess the risk associated with ‘ergonomic problems’.Different criteria adopted to formulate the prescription/restriction by the occupational physician.Consequently, the difficulties are:Adopting a common strategy to map the risks associated with workstations.Having a standardized approach to link the workstation analysis phase with the phase relating to the worker's specific limitations in order to proceed with work reintegration. Properly managing the principles of employability.The employability of people requires awareness, knowledge, and commitment on the part of managers and leaders. They are key stakeholders in the efficiency of the employability management process. For this reason, one of the main issues is to provide and expand the culture of integration among leaders and managers to ensure that work is adapted to people with disabilities and specific physical/mental needs.The approach to correct employability management is summarized in the flowchart below. IMAGE By following the process shown in the flowchart, it is possible to identify certain priorities.For the Worker/Restriction Phase:All restrictions assigned to a worker to safeguard their health must be standardized using a code that can be linked to each workstation (at least country by country). Standardize the meaning of work requirements and restrictions between different sites/countries using a common language.The Workstation phase requires:Risk exposure data must be coded (chemical agents, vibrations, biomechanical overload) to map each workstation. The coding of risk exposure depends on the strategy adopted for risk assessment and must be linkable to the worker's restriction.The allocation phase will be the result of an analysis of the compatibility between the results of the cross-evaluation of the work phase and the workstation phase; in the event of incompatibility, it will be necessary to analyze how to adapt (if possible) the workstation with engineering or administrative solutions.The assessment of compatibility between the disability or chronic condition and the workplace can be expressed through a work plan defined in agreement with the worker's manager (team leader, supervisor, human resources member) based on the occupational physician's recommendations, supported by ergonomists in the event of ergonomic issues, and considering the health/ propensity of the worker, who modulates/avoids work activities/tasks that could be harmful or aggravate the worker's health conditions.Only if it is not possible to adapt the workplace or identify a personal work plan will it be necessary to identify a new job/work position. This is because it is necessary to consider the difficulty, often associated with the lack of guarantees of maintaining productivity on the one hand and acceptability/professional satisfaction on the other.Following the process shown in the flowchart, it is possible to identify some priorities.For the Worker/Restriction Phase:All restrictions assigned to a worker to safeguard their health must be standardized using a code that can be linked to each workstation (at least country by country). Standardize the meaning of work requirements and restrictions between different sites/countries using a common language.The Workstation phase requires:Risk exposure data must be coded (chemical agents, vibrations, biomechanical overload) to map each workstation.

      "abstract": "This paper examines the human determinants of organizational creativity.Information is derived from the reports of scientists, administrators, and educators, who are intensifying study of this topic.An understanding of the creative process facilitates apprecia tion of the nature of creative work, appraisal of creativity training programs, evaluation of environmental factors, and utilization of operational techniques.The creative process consists of seven interdependent and interweaving stages: early preparation, in which the mind assimilates great volumes of diverse information; intense encounter with the problem; conscious probing into the problem, its factors, and possible solutions; incubation, wherein subconscious processes attack the problem; illumination, the conscious recognition of momentous insight; verification or elaboration of the idea; and gaining acceptance of the creation.Recent psychological studies have isolated traits underlying creative ability.Tests are in use which measure these traits.Prominent traits of the creative person are intelligence, sensitivity fluency, flexibility, originality, and redefinition.He tends to be inner directed, sensitive to his own emotions, independent, selfconfident, dominating, and inhibited by exacting internal standards.He manifests a personality sufficiently integrated to reconcile viii ix internal ambiguities.Slight variations in personality profiles may determine the fields in which individuals excel creatively.Creativity normally declines gradually with age, after reaching a peak, usually between 25 and 40 years of age.Evidence suggests that creative ability may be increased through training.Participation in brainstorming sessions is found to increase ideational fluency and the production of good quality ideas.Other training techniques seem to enhance originality, sometimes at the expense of ideational fluency.Laboratory evidence suggests that subjects can be trained to be more original, that such behavior can be reinforced, and that such training has enduring effects.Environmental factors may encourage or inhibit creativity.In the creative environment, administrators evince a sincere desire for creativity and work toward achieving pervasive communications, flexible schedules, and some relief from routine work.The past is not w o r shipped, but regarded as a step toward a greater future.Incentives are based upon administrative insights into the need hierarchies and abilities of subordinates.The tendency toward conformity within groups m a y be weakened through manipulating group composition and attraction, and through encouraging productive interaction patterns.Full group participation and tolerance of goal-directed disagreement facilitate creative decisions.Augmenting general organizational creativity are techniques designed to help solve specific problems.Thought provokers (analytical techniques, forced choice techniques, and checklists) may aid indivi duals to visualize novel solutions not otherwise perceived.Group assault upon appropriate problems is also practiced, particularly brainstorming.Objective evidence suggests that brainstorming is a superior conference technique for obtaining many diverse ideas about open-end problems.It seems, however, that individual brainstorming may excel group brainstorming in number of ideas produced and number of good quality ideas.Worthy of watching is the Gordon technique, wherein a permanent panel is gradually informed of the problem during the session.To maximize organizational creativity, an integrated program appears advisable, including the use of material contained herein to staff the organization with creative personnel, to develop the creative abilities and propensities of all personnel, to provide a climate conducive to creativity, and to select judiciously from among operational techniques.",

Psychological assessment plays an important role in clinical, educational, and legal settings. Bias inherent in clinical, intellectual, and neuropsychological assessment may contribute to disparate prevalence rates and invalidate the results for diverse populations. Excluding or ignoring diverse psychological experiences can affect the validity of assessment outcomes. Gaining a better understanding of how cultural issues relate to the assessment of mental health, intellectual, and cognitive functioning may increase diagnostic accuracy, as well as help address educational and mental health disparities.",

Students need to attain 21st century skills like problem-solving, creativity, innovation, metacognition, communication etc. to endure in the modern world. Problem-solving skill is one of the fundamental human cognitive processes. Whenever students face a situation where they do not know the way to complete a task, the problem occurs. Problem-solving is a process, which involves systematic observation and critical thinking to find an appropriate solution or way to reach the desired goal. The framework of problem-solving consisted of two major skills: observation and critical thinking skill. Observation skill refers to collecting data, understanding and interpreting the meaning of the information using all the senses. Critical thinking involves the individual’s ability to do the following: conceptualizing, logical reasoning, applying strategy, analytical thinking, decision making and synthesizing to solve any problem.",

      "abstract": "A person's intelligence (or IQ) has long been synonymous with cognitive and general abilities to function daily on an effective level. When traumatic brain injury occurs, there is a natural desire to find some measure that identifies the amount of damage that has occurred and whether it is permanent or temporary. Given the popularity of the IQ test, there is a tendency to use this measure as such a yardstick. It is argued that such a global measure is not appropriate. The predominant reason that it is not a wise choice is that IQ test does not tap into many of the critical areas of a person's functioning, such as personality regulation, shorter-term memory, various types of attentional capacity, and the ability to organize and plan effectively. Rather, to truly and accurately reflect a person's neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses requires the use of many different measures, not just a single one such as an IQ score.",

To better adapt to the changing environment and daily challenges, people need to learn new skills and knowledge by practicing repetitively. The learning effect mainly depends on brain plasticity during training, and decreases over time due to becoming tired, losing energy, and failing to sustain attention. Cognitive fatigue (CF) is about the decrement in mental effort or self-motivation when engaging in cognitively demanding tasks. Due to inevitable CF during repetitive training, the task performance cannot be improved or maintained permanently",

Since leisure activities are part of one’s lifestyle, adopting this perspective to leisure research is invaluable. By reviewing a variety of research, the article discusses 1) the progress of psychological leisure research and the impact of leisure on subjective well-being and cognitive functioning, 2) transitions in leisure and their relationship from a life-course perspective, and 3) the benefits related to the accumulation of leisure activities across the lifespan. The present review concludes that positive psychological achievement (e.g., self-worth, affirmation, and self-realization) and cognitive foundation (e.g., high levels of basic cognitive skills) shaped through leisure participation in early life stages help overcome challenges in later stages (i.e., successfully adapt to psychological vulnerability and cognitive decline in old age).",

      "title": "Metacognition’s potential for Existentialism in classrooms",
      "abstract": "Abstract The instrumentality and standardization of education may be important for functioning in contemporary societies. However, reducing education to measurable competencies may result in the loss of human value. Indeed, education becomes real when it relates to the reality of individuals. Existentialist education focuses on students’ freedom and agency; however, it is criticized for not having coherent and convincing educational guides. This analytical comparison paper argues that the premises of Existentialism and the components of metacognition may interact. While metacognitive awareness and thinking for essence lays the ground for individuality and autonomy, metacognitive knowledge relates to self-knowledge and not accepting ready-made concepts through self-questioning and dialogic encounters. Also, metacognitive experiences might mimic existential crises where individuals engage in highly conscious thinking during which metacognitive knowledge and regulation simultaneously help the individual deal with failure or anxiety. During such experiences, metacognitive regulation might facilitate individuals’ free choices and responsible engagement when building the self or handling difficulties. In this sense, enhancing metacognition may help individuals’ transition to the existing phase by building adequate self-knowledge and regulating thinking. This paper, finally, describes a set of pedagogies for fostering metacognition that could potentially facilitate existential attitudes or behaviors in mainstream classrooms.",

Experimental techniques are used with hypotheses to examine causal relationships. Differential techniques are used to study individual differences in cognition and to look for relationships among cognitive processes.

      "title": "The Relationship Between Student Development Theory and a Professional Abilities Model for Physical Therapy Education",
      "abstract": "Background and Purpose. Generic abilities define a repertoire of behaviors deemed essential for success in the physical therapy profession. Many physical therapist education programs have adopted some form of the generic abilities to foster and measure development of professional behaviors by students. Methods proposed for fostering development of professional behaviors include explicit instruction, role modeling, mentoring, guided reflection, and individual advising. Understanding of the cognitive and psychosocial development of individual students and appreciation of the impact of the developmental level on readiness to learn may help guide educators in choosing the most appropriate interventions for students across the spectrum of maturity and throughout the developmental process. The purpose of this article is to examine a model of generic abilities from the perspective of student development theory. Position and Rationale. Descriptors and sample behaviors of a model of generic abilities were analyzed in terms of the major tenets of 4 theories of intellectual and ethical development, cognitive development, and moral development. Aspects of psychosocial and identity development appear linked to all of the professional abilities. Cognitive development seems closely linked to behaviors of problem solving and critical thinking. Moral development may influence broad areas of professionalism, responsibility, and social responsibility. Discussion and Conclusion. An understanding of broad aspects of psychosocial, cognitive, and moral development may enhance the effectiveness of physical therapy faculty in nurturing development of professional behaviors in physical therapist students. The developmental process may be enhanced by fostering an environment that provides essential challenges and appropriate support for students across all 3 domains of development throughout the physical therapy curriculum.",

      "title": "Significance of self-efficacy model in educational work with adolescents",
      "abstract": "The frame of reference in this paper is based on Bandura's concept of self-efficacy. The theory of self-efficacy is based on the importance of subjective experience of personal competence in realizing different goals and tasks, rather than on real knowledge and skills. It supports reciprocal causation according to which a person is observed holistically through dynamic effect of personal factors (cognitive, emotional and biological), factors of the environment and behavior. Development of self-efficacy strongly determines future behavior of a person in achieving goals, since it initiates action, determines the amount of required effort, persistence in facing obstacles, and resilience in unwanted situations. Many different scales are used in assessing selfefficacy (e.g. Children's Self-Efficacy Scale, Parents' Self-Efficacy Scale, Teachers' Self-Efficacy Scale, etc.). They consist of several subscales that can greatly contribute to understanding adolescents and predicting their functioning, depending on the assessed contextual area. Previous researches confirmed the influence of students' selfefficacy on their academic achievements, professional aspirations, and prosocial behavior. In the last couple of years there have been more and more researches which analyze the role of self-efficacy in behavioral disorders, such as peer aggression, cigarette smoking, drug abuse, excessive use of the Internet, etc.",

      "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: implications for the classroom teacher",
      "abstract": "This article is the culmination of field observations, discussions with classroom teachers and a review of the existing research base for meeting the classroom needs of students with attention deficit hyperactive disordered needs. Specifically the article describes strategies that classroom teachers can utilize to better meet the attention needs of their students with attention deficit hyperactive disordered needs. Every strategy is discussed in terms of how the strategy should be implemented and this discussion is followed by a heading in which current research findings that relate to the strategy are briefly discussed. ********** Students labeled attention deficit hyperactive disordered (ADHD) display many characteristics that make the sustaining of attention problematic (Welton, 1999). Some of these characteristics include but are not limited to: (1) often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork; (2) often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork; (3) often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly; (4) often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities; and (5) often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort such as schoolwork or homework (Accardo, Blondis, Stein, & Whitman, 2000). However, in order to fully understand these characteristics, it is important to first understand the different parts that make-up the process of attention. For example, the process of attention demands that the learner focus that is pick or select something that needs attention. However, in order for the learner to be able to sustain or pay attention for as long as the required task demands, the learner must be able to resist or avoid things that remove his or her attention from where it needs to be. Depending upon the classroom situation, the learner may also need to shift or to move his or her attention to something else when the task demand requires slight modification. In this article, several strategies will be described that can be used by the teacher to better engage the attention of students with ADHD in his or her classroom. These strategies were created after several periods of observing students with ADHD and after several meeting with three classroom teachers that had students labeled as having ADHD in their classrooms. Strategy #1: To increase the use of positive reinforcement This strategy calls the classroom teacher' s attention to the frequency in which the student with ADHD receives negative comments or even punishments. When observing a student labeled ADHD, it was quite common to witness the teacher berating the student for his or her lack of focused attention, talking out of turn as well as participating in distracting behaviors like the clicking of a pen or the bending of a paper clip. However, once the teachers were shown the frequency in which they had delivered negative comments and we had an opportunity to discuss the replacement of these negative comments with positive verbal reinforcement (such as, You keep improving!; Wow, you have completed half of the page, I know you'll get the rest done by the end of the period!; Sensational effort, keep up the good work!). The teachers were truly amazed at the effort the students demonstrated in response to the positive comments was well as a decrease in the frequency in which negative behaviors occurred. Current Research Findings The use of positive verbal praise goes a long way toward fostering better self-esteem for learners with ADHD (McCluskey & McCluskey, 1999). A student's self-esteem or self-worth is fostered when the teacher creates a classroom environment in which the student with ADHD feels his or her efforts will be recognized. Through such recognition, the student with ADHD can perceive that they have competencies and that they will succeed at school-related tasks. …",

Correlational research has demonstrated that social rejection and low intellectual performance are related, as loneliness is associated with poor cognitive functioning. Experimental research has shed light on the correlational findings, as participants assigned to be rejected performed slowly and inaccurately on reasoning problems relative to participants assigned to control conditions. Hence, social rejection reduces intelligent thought. Evidence also indicates that rejection reduces self-control, as people who are rejected perform poorly on a wealth of self-control tasks.",

      "title": "Stigma of the Mental Patient",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are defined as changes in thinking, feeling, inadequacy or impairment of psychological and social functioning. The adult population has about 50% probability of suffering of at least one episode of mental illness during their lifetime. The bearer of mental illness is seen as a different individual, unable to perform certain functions and even as a threat to society, conditions that increase their personal suffering, the fear of being rejected, despised and undervalued leading to its progressive social exclusion. Discriminatory attitudes undermine the harmonious coexistence among all, in our daily lives. The distortion and lack of information about mental illness can cause increasing stigma. Patients attempt to hide their problem for fear of being left out in different areas of your life. The demystification of incurability, dangerousness and disability of mental patients should be a priority. To change the way you think and see the other, we should meet the primary objectives: emancipation of the patient with mental disorder; reduction of discrimination and stigma; improvement of individual social competence and creating a social support system for long duration. The fact that we ignore our ghosts does not eliminate them. There should be made an effort to improve inclusion and not exclusion. The entire community is to be responsible for the rehabilitation and cure of the mental patient.",

      "abstract": "Introduction:   Decision   Capacity   Assessment is one of the functions of consultation psychiatry.  It  involves  the  ability  to  make choices autonomously and arises in a relevant way in clinical practice as a precondition to informed consent.Aims:  The  authors  pretend  to  review  the process underlying decision capacity assessment, as well as other relevant information published in this regard.Methods: Non systematic review of the literature, through electronic search in Medline/Pubmed.Results: The ability to decide can only be assessed  in  relation  to  a  particular  decision,  and  its  outcome  is  not  necessarily stable  over  time.  Similarly,  there  is  no single  diagnosis  that  allows  concluding for  incapacity,  nor  dispensing  its  proper evaluation.  It  depends  on  various  factors like  the  thought  content,  thinking  process or  cognitive  functions.  It  can  also  be  influenced by the individual’s level of edu- cation, personality traits, emotional states/ coping mechanisms or circumstantial factors. Every doctor should be able to carry out this evaluation. The liaison psychiatrist should  be  involved  in  case  of  suspected mental illness that can impair the ability to  consent  or  before  the  need  to  validate an assessment already taken. Appelbaum and Grisso proposed a systematic evaluation  based  on  the  following  criteria:  a) communication  of  choice,  b)  understanding, c) appreciation and d) rational decision making. In an attempt to minimize differences between evaluators, several assessment  instruments  were  developed, among  which  the  MacArthur  Competence Assessment  Tool  assumes  a  special  focus. Mini  Mental  State  Examination  has  also been  used  in  patients  with  cognitive  impairment, emerging proposals for correlating the scores obtained with the presence of decision-making. When a patient is unable to decide, it should be respected his best interest, and seek a “replacement decision”, with respect for ethics and the law.Conclusions: A patient who is able to deci- de must present: a) attention focused on the problem; b) ability to consider the different options proposed; c) ability to assess the risks and  benefits  and  d   ability  to  anticipate their possible results.",

      "title": "The Exploring of Visual Imagery: In their Relation to the Students’ Mathematical Identity",
      "abstract": "The learning principles usually not visually. The visual understood as an analytical and facilitate an idea. That is the visual is parallel to other representation. The visual ability is not only a tool, or a strategy, or a type of thinking, but also the chain of reasoning to achieve the formal analytic abilities. In this study, the visual ability examined, as a strategy or way of thinking to solve a problem. The question to be addressed is: How do students come to their mathematics identities based on visual imagery? The research conducted at classes of the preservice mathematics education students namely provides evidence for what is their identity relative to their experiences. The results conducted based on explorative studies for the visual abilities. The performance obtained during the teaching and learning, i.e., visualizing and answering analytically or visually, manipulating and answering analytically or visually or by formulas, and visualizing and the answering visually or analytically or based on the conditions. The performance linked to the visual representation and related to intuition underlies formal abilities. The visual perceptions disturbed by prior knowledge, and the level based on optical illusions, so the teaching and learning make a difference between potential and abilities. The analytical affects visual perception and the belief system, so difficult to construct knowledge. However, the level of thinking is different, i.e., not yet formal or new optical illusion. The visual model related to high-level thinking, which distinguished from the analytical thinking model. In the visual model, thinking activities based on the transformations and understood as the other operations in mathematics. The visual model also shows the analytic thinking and hierarchical. The visual and the analytical thinking integrated to develop a richer understanding of mathematical concepts. Through visual thinking, the mental processing was constructed and interpreted as mental objects and processed analytically. The next, exhibits the analytical, consist of the construction process from the visual, namely the reflective abstractions. The visual abilities not related to the duration of courses in the mathematics education department. The longer increases the analytic but in contrary to the visual. Through the learning of the visual abilities, the difficulties in solving the problems decrease, but resistant to the analytic show a specific performance. Visual learning reveals a hierarchical level of the thinking, so the best performance is the highest learning ability. When learning the visual abilities given, the performance increases.",

These challenges are often along a range; people need assistive devices customized to their specific needs. However, existing assistive technologies, like prompting systems, lack the capabilities to customize support for diverse needs. With the advent of smart home devices, there are opportunities to design prompting systems that support diverse accessibility and motivational needs, thereby supporting the regular practice of daily activities. To understand design factors for such devices, we interviewed adults with cognitive disabilities, parents, and caregivers. Our participants described their needs for future prompting systems, including structuring tasks, supporting motivation, and introducing community support. This paper presents insights and design suggestions for context-aware assistive technologies that could help people with cognitive disabilities regularly perform everyday activities.",

      "title": "Cognition, Metacognition, and Self-Regulated Learning",
      "abstract": "Psychology’s attention to mental events took root in the middle of the 19th century and grew through studies of learning, forgetting, and problem solving. Following several decades during which behaviorism dominated the field, cognitive studies of learning rapidly expanded after the mid-1960s. Foci for research concerned how learners acquire different kinds information, particularly declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and schemas, and identifying cognitive operations learners can apply to transform experience into knowledge. What learners know significantly shapes what they learn. Prior knowledge often benefits learning, but inaccurate knowledge, called misconceptions, and skills applied indiscriminately can impede it. Effort to learn, called cognitive load, is not a unary concept. Designing learning tasks to focus cognition in ways germane to content is one key to effective instruction. Learners can think about their cognition and its properties. This is metacognition. Examples include judgments of whether and what is learned, planning shaped by the relative success in tasks and affective experiences, and decisions to abandon risky or unproductive tasks. Measures of metacognition, predominantly learners’ reports as opposed to direct indicators, correlate modestly with achievement, but this may reflect that students are not often educated in study tactics and learning strategies. Metacognition is a key factor in learners’ decisions about which study tactics and learning strategies they use, and a challenge learners face is overcoming overconfidence about what they know. The metacognitive decision-making event is modeled as an <sc>If–Then</sc> production. Metacognitive control of how learners choose to go about learning is conditional on metacognitive monitoring of conditions the learner believes will influence learning processes and outcomes. When learners experiment with approaches to learning, they engage in self-regulated learning (SRL). SRL is a very energetic area of research that spans investigations into learners’ metacognition about conditions for learning, operations on information, products resulting from those operations, and evaluations of products in terms of standards the learner holds; the COPES model. Like its foundation in metacognition, SRL also correlates modestly with achievement and is similarly challenged by relying on learners’ self-reports about SRL. However, learners can be taught how to better apply SRL which may realize benefits to achievement.",

It is demonstrated that in the structure of the ability to goal-setting there are the following components: intellectual, personal, activity. The personal (individual-personal qualities, value system) and activity (volitional qualities) components in women at different stages of self-realization have been studied and compared. It is established that students who are at the stage of self-understanding and self-perception are not capable of responsible goal setting because they have an ideal self-image, overestimated self-esteem, underdeveloped reflection and reduced efficiency of adaptation, conflict of values (universalism - achievement, security - independence, independence - comfort), a pessimistic view of future-oriented events without developed volitional qualities. It was found that female students have certain goals, but are not always able to present a more or less clear picture of the desired future, so the ultimate goal may not be justified and is unstable. It is shown that women at the stage of selfrealization live in the present, have a real idea of themselves, they lack full self-satisfaction, which with a strong self-esteem and generally positive assessment of their personality encourages respondents to further self-improvement. It has been shown that women use volitional qualities when achieving goals, have a conflict of values (stimulation - security), which is characteristic of mature adaptive individuals, with a certain level of dignity and flexibility.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Theoretical and empirical efforts to develop valid methods by which to identify people with mental retardation and related disabilities have been underway for approximately 100 years. Recently, there is a growing consensus that mental retardation is best conceptualized as significant limitations in the multidimensional construct of personal competence. In addition to physical competence, personal competence is conceptualized to include, at the broadest level of conceptualization, the domains of conceptual, practical, and social intelligence. Due to limitations in personal competence, the defining characteristic of persons with mental retardation is an ongoing need for types and intensities of support that most others in society do not require. Current models of personal competence are described and the types of measurement tools available to measure essential dimensions of personal competence are discussed. Additionally, a systematic approach is described for assessing support needs and developing plans to meet these needs.",

      "abstract": "Critical thinking ability is important to be possessed by every individual, especially in the era of globalization. The ability to think critically supports the individual to overcome the problems in life, among which environmental problems are. Individuals and environments cannot be separated, the relationship between them is reciprocal. Solutions to environmental problems can be realized through critical thinking. Each individual's critical thinking ability varies, depending on the frequency of frequent exercises to develop that ability. Such exercises include frequently asking questions, posing assumptions, identifying information, making inferences, identifying impacts, and so on. It is therefore important to identify the critical thinking skills of individuals in a forum. Description of the ability to think critically about environmental problems is expected to be the basis for the design of development of learning plan set related to the subject of Environmental Knowledge. The description of students' critical thinking ability is obtained through questions prepared according to Polya’s problem solving syntax. The set of questions contains elements of reasoning that are judged based on the intellectual standards of reasoning by Paul and Elder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social cognition focuses on the mental processes involved in social interactions. In the participatory planning process, which puts into use the knowledge and skills of individuals through active interaction, the study of social cognitive abilities seems relevant. The objective of this article is to review the social cognitive factors and their implications in participatory planning and designing. Social cognitions are observed early in childhood and they develop over decades through experience. It appears that they are partially independent of formal intelligence. The existing data suggests that social cognition may have a biological basis in the form of neurophysiological substrates and genetic loci. Social cognitions help in comprehending, adjusting interpretations, thinking of multiple alternatives, social problem solving and in various other processes. Social cognitions are instrumental in dealing with a variety of interpersonal problems observed during interactions in the group and in coping with potential stressors like negative outcomes. Various factors like positive mood states, belief in self‐efficacy and goals may affect social cognition and planning and decision‐making processes. These findings suggest that practitioners and researchers of participatory change processes should pay attention to social cognition. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Summary Remarkably little is known regarding what people talk to themselves about (inner speech use) in their everyday lives. Existing self‐directed speech measures (e.g., thought sampling and questionnaires) either uniquely capture inner speech frequency and neglect its content or classify self‐reported thoughts instances in overly simplistic categories determined by the researchers. In the current study, we describe an open‐format thought listing procedure as well as a refined coding scheme and present detailed inner speech content self‐generated by 76 university students. The most frequently self‐reported inner speech activities were self‐regulation (e.g., planning and problem solving), self‐reflection (e.g., emotions, self‐motivation, appearance, behavior/performance, and autobiography), critical thinking (e.g., evaluating, judging, and criticizing), people in general, education, and current events. Inner speech occurred most commonly while studying and driving. These results are consistent with the self‐regulatory and self‐referential functions of inner speech often emphasized in the literature. Future research avenues using the open‐format inner speech listing procedure and coding scheme are proposed.",

Les stratégies en prévention et en promotion de la santé mentale mises de l’avant dans les établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire offrent les plus belles possibilités de rejoindre un grand nombre de jeunes adultes. Cependant, malgré l’intérêt grandissant pour de telles initiatives en milieu scolaire, les méta-analyses et les revues des écrits scientifiques recensés mettent en lumière les difficultés reliées à l’évaluation des stratégies utilisées et aux possibilités de répliquer les interventions, particulièrement en ce qui a trait à la promotion. Les stratégies les plus efficaces sur le plan de l’amélioration de la santé mentale semblent être associées à la supervision d’exercices en lien avec l’intervention telles que les exercices de pleine conscience ( mindfulness ), les techniques cognitives-comportementales, la relaxation et le développement d’habiletés sociales.

Executive functions, which include working memory, inhibitory control, and attentional shifting are fundamental to cognitive strategies supporting effective self-regulation of emotions and behaviors. Executive functions include cognitive processes associated with working memory, inhibitory control, and attentional shifting. Deficits in these cognitive processes are found along with the dysregulated emotionality characteristic of anxiety disorders and depression. Effective emotion regulation is associated with prosocial behavior, social connections, strong working memory, and better physical and mental health. Executive functions – attentional shifting, working memory, and inhibitory control – are the underlying cognitive processes supporting effective self-regulation of emotions and behaviors. Anxiety disorders are associated with deficits in each of the traditional constructs of executive functions as well as cognitive reappraisal.",

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to argue that workers need to develop another core competency, knowledge and skill, that is, spiritual intelligence (SI). Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on a literature review to support its conclusions. In this sense, this paper carefully examines relevant popular and academic books, handbooks, articles, papers, thesis and doctoral dissertations related to SI. In addition, this paper depicts a conceptual model of SI that is made up of some research propositions, namely, professional moral courage, altruism, hope state, optimism, cooperative capacity, organizational justice mindset and listening skill. Findings Overall, the literature review suggests that without such a capacity, we would be enjoying merely impoverished lives (here referred to as the outcome of a set of harmful aspects such as an existence without spiritual compass, meaning, worthy purposes and desire to face the shadows of our own personality). Practical implications This paper proposes that SI is the path to reach and develop our own spirituality. When this ability is triggered, we are potentially able to make some important contributions to the people that live around and rely on us. Originality/value This paper argues that SI can be regarded as a human capacity that connects us with the ultimate frontier, that is, the spiritual realm. As such, it is proposed that it can be cultivated over time in a careful and disciplined way by anyone that is really interested in developing his or her spirituality.",

      "abstract": "The demands of the world today have opened the field to the study of emotional intelligence, within the integral formation of the human being. A considerable number of researches conclude that emotions are a key piece of configuration for personal success, since the recognition and management of one's own and others' emotions results in people who are full and happy. Thus, society and the school are aware of the need for a specific curriculum that favors the identification and management of emotions. Emotions represent the way in which an individual reacts to various situations, learned through experiences and educated throughout the course of life. Emotional competencies regulate the emotional phenomena to which people are exposed daily. They allow students to solve problems and produce products in their different contexts of life. Opting, in this way, for a different way of being intelligent; which departs from the classical definition of rational intelligence, and which approaches the real social context. The development of emotional education in school is one of the most effective psychopedagogical innovations of recent years. Through the application of a plan of contextualized objectives, according to the educational level in which the group of students is located, and under the emotional leadership of the teacher, they respond to different social needs, which are not sufficiently addressed in ordinary academic competences. What means that to choose the diversification of capacities and the development of methodological strategies for the orientation, control and strengthening of the emotional aspect, will be the base of the success to maintain the good human relations and to obtain the personal and professional improvement.",

People find meaning in diverse places, so the questions (needs for meaning) may be more constant than the answers. Self-rated meaningfulness often emphasizes family, love, work, and religion, some of which seem little more than basic animal drives embellished with meaningfulness. Self-rated meaningfulness rises and falls in response to mundane events, increasing after seeing simple orderly patterns and while performing routines, and decreasing after interpersonal rejection. Searching for meaning is largely uncorrelated with finding or having it. Applying meaning to life may increase its incompleteness. Self-rated happiness correlates with meaningfulness, but important differences exist, including differential relevance of goal satisfaction, time span, interpersonal relations, stressful involvements, and self-expression.",

It is equally true that research questions can also affect how one understands or experiences topical issues in a later personal experience. The researcher's personal experience dealing with a child with attention hyperactivity disorder became a factor in her reaction to the suggestion that she herself was dyslexic. Reflecting on the labeling of people with deficit conditions resulted in increased understanding of her own situation and an altered perception of research objects. No matter how hard the researcher tries to be objective, he or she cannot escape the personal components of the interpretive framework being applied. Research is furthered when those personal constructions are acknowledged and examined. The dialectic between research and researcher cannot be ignored. (Contains 17 references.)

That's the underlying question of our research on the perception of computer science among the general population as to what constitutes their concept of it. Two qualitative studies based on grounded theory [6] lead to the development of a model of different types of situations of contacts (SoC). SoC can be classified as perceived and non-perceived contact situations. If a situation is not consciously perceived, a person's concept of computer science remains unchanged. If a situation is consciously perceived, the concept may evolve. The results show that the perception of computer science can either be classified as a \"tool\" which facilitates an individual's professional and private workflow or as an \"obstacle\", which can arise either from the use of software or other digital tools, or externally through guidelines, technical progress or through purchases by third parties (e.g. children and their environment). The distinction between perceived and non-perceived situations of contact and between a tool and an obstacle relies on an individual complexity rating.",

Neither being a mental capacity nor a performance dexterity, self-regulation is the self-directed procedure through which learners translate their psychological capacities into task-related skills in several situations, such as academics, athletics, music, and health. In addition to the conceptualization and describing the intellectual environment in which the construct of self-regulated learning developed, this chapter discusses definitions and characteristics of self-regulated learning.

The impact of AI on society also raises important social and ethical questions. How societies adapt and integrate AI technologies will also play a significant role. If societies prioritize education systems that encourage critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, and emotional intelligence alongside the use of AI, the overall level of human intelligence could increase. Conversely, if AI leads to a devaluation of these skills in favor of purely technical skills, it could have a negative impact on the development of complete intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract General intelligence (g) is a highly practical ability that affects personal well-being in many aspects of life. This article reviews five key facts documenting its pervasive utility, and then illustrates how higher levels of intelligence enhance an individual’s performance and well-being in four realms of daily life: work, daily self-maintenance, chronic illness, and accidents. The first key fact is that people who do well on one mental test tend to perform well on all of them; that is, all mental tests correlate with one other. All measure mostly the same underlying ability factor, no matter what their manifest content or purpose. Mental abilities differ in their generality-specificity, and the general mental ability factor, g , is the most general of all. Second, high intelligence is expressed as a set of generic thinking skills that includes learning efficiently, reasoning well, thinking abstractly, and solving novel problems. These information-processing skills can be applied to virtually any kind of content in any context. Hence, third, everyday life continually requires individuals to learn and reason well. Fourth, ample evidence shows that general intelligence not only predicts many forms of success and well-being but usually does so better than socioeconomic status. More specific mental abilities add little to prediction beyond that contributed by g alone. Fifth, intelligence predicts performance better when tasks are more complex. Although higher intelligence is somewhat useful in many life arenas, it is particularly advantageous when jobs and daily tasks are more cognitively demanding. It is therefore important to know the distribution of task demands in different life areas. Four life arenas illustrate how more cognitively demanding tasks put less intelligent individuals at greater risk. Job analysis research has repeatedly shown that the major distinction among jobs is their cognitive complexity, for example, their requirements for obtaining, analyzing, communicating, and applying oral, written, pictorial, and behavioral information. Consistent with this finding, intelligence predicts job performance progressively better in higher level jobs,",

      "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to present the findings of the research about the role of different intelligences in overcoming the differences in employee value system as a source of success. Design/methodology/approach Based on their previous research, the authors used desk and informal field research, the Dialectical Systems Theory and its Law of Requisite Holism. Findings The integration of one’s personal development with one’s individual intelligence influences human value systems. Knowledge and developing of various types of intelligence matter: it lets individuals develop faster, in the long run. The higher one’s level of intelligence is, the easier one finds it to face problems or experience. Thus, one is becoming a mature personality, who can overcome extreme alternatives to the briefed human values. This process can also receive meaningful support from the exercise of social responsibility, which is one’s responsibility for one’s impacts on society, i.e. people and nature. Success of the process depends on “personal requisite holism”. The top managers need significantly more emotional and social competences than the others. Research limitations/implications The topic is researched with qualitative analysis in desk and informal field research. Quantitative methodological approach took place in the authors’ cited previous publications. Practical implications Work distribution makes the leaders and subordinates differ in prevailing values, too. Mastering of these differences will support business success, survival of jobs included and well-being of coworkers from both groups. Application of the cognitive, emotional and spiritual intelligences might help the organization meet this need. The fourth – physical intelligence – supports ensuring the psychological well-being at work; from this, other mentioned intelligences have been developed. Mastering of these differences can also receive support from methods of creative cooperation, social responsibility and personal requisite holism; the authors have reported about these elsewhere, and only point to these in this study. Social implications The more holistic intelligences system generates a more socially responsible society. Originality/value No similar concept is offered in the available literature.",

      "title": "Understanding Developmental Coordination Disorder",
      "abstract": "Almost every adapted physical education teacher, recreation therapist, or general activity leader knows at least one individual (and more likely knows several) who has difficulty learning sport skills, whose movements appear dissimilar from peers, and/or who doesn’t do well when playing games and sports. That same individual may have difficulty with fine motor skills, have very hard to read hand writing, and may look clumsy when performing daily tasks. This individual lacks coordination. It may be that this lack of coordination is the result of a concomitant disability, inadequate opportunities to develop motor skills, or just lack of effort. However, lack of coordination may also be a result of the individual having a developmental coordination disorder.Any individual experiencing coordination problems may feel left out, inadequate, unhappy, frustrated, and embarrassed by his or her ineptness. These feelings can result in said individual’s withdrawal and/or refusal to join in and participate in physical activity. Lack of coordination can also lead to that individual being disruption in an attempt to shift attention from away from his or her lack of competence. This individual may be “labeled” lazy, slow, clumsy, stupid, or troublemaker, but no matter what the label, the individual has a problem. Lack of coordination can have lasting effects in all areas of daily life. For the physical education student with a developmental coordination disorder, frustration can lead to refusal to participate and future negative attitudes about physical activity. Lacking coordination in motor activity can also, in later life, lead to complete aversion to leading an active lifestyle. But, while general assumptions regarding who has a developmental coordination disorder, who is uncoordinated due to a disability, and who is just having transitory difficulty mastering a skill, can be made, it is important for physical education, recreation, and sport professionals to be able to distinguish the specifics of developmental coordination disorder in order to provide appropriate and timely intervention. This article explores determination of developmental coordination disorder, causes of chronic coordination problems, how a lack of coordination relates to other disabilities, and how lack of remediation can have a negative lasting effect on an active lifestyle. Most important, this article will include techniques for activity professionals to use to assist a student with developmental coordination disorder in mastering physical activity and sport skills. These techniques are equally appropriate for implementation in one-on-one situations and large classes, as well as with sports teams.Subscribe to Palaestra",

      "title": "Dyslexia: Hidden talents in the workplace",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this PhD research was to apply the principles of Positive Dyslexia to the current status of dyslexia in the workplace, with the long-term aim of creating tools to enable companies to become dyslexia friendly. Positive Dyslexia, according to Nicolson (2015), has the main aim of allowing dyslexic people to find their strengths, to craft their lives according to these strengths and thus to exploit the possibilities that these can bring to their own lives, and for the advantage of others. Four studies are presented within this thesis. Taking as starting point the “Dyslexia Decathlon”, developed by two qualitative studies from S. Agahi et al. (2014) is a set of ten skills that were found to be characteristic in those with dyslexia. These ten skills were divided into three pillars (social, cognitive and work strengths) which were all underpinned by the capacity for unconventional thinking. The social pillar includes traits such as teamwork, empathy and communication; The Mental pillar is composed by innovation/creativity, visuo-spatial and big-picture thinking and the work pillar determination and resilience, proactivity and flexible coping. The empirical work undertaken for the assessment of the dyslexia decathlon used a sampling of successful dyslexic adults and entrepreneurs. Therefore one of the aims of this thesis was to establish whether the skills identified for the dyslexia decathlon skills also can be understood to be present at an earlier age or not. The findings were followed up, in order to develop principles that would allow companies to “talent manage” their dyslexic employees.\r\n\r\nStudy 1 was undertaken with 251 non-dyslexic students and 70 dyslexic students, all from the University of Sheffield. The findings from this study revealed that dyslexic students showed significantly higher entrepreneurial intentions and traits when compared with the non-dyslexic student sample, together with a range of significant differences in parts of the Dyslexia Decathlon.\r\nStudy 2 aimed to address the limitations present in Study 1, by using a qualitative approach to understand discrepancies in the finding associated with the themes of Resilience, Big Picture Thinking, Visual Spatial and Communication skills. The findings demonstrated that although dyslexic individuals have strong qualities and traits, such as the capacity for creativity, determination, resilience, persistence, strong communication skills and empathy (Eide & Eide, 2012; West, 2009), these four variables were also found to be underdeveloped in some aspects, hence the reason for some of the discrepancies expressed in the variables of Study 1. Therefore, there is a constant need for development in order for individuals with dyslexia to excel to their highest potential and advantage. Studies 3 and 4 changed focus to dyslexia in the workplace, and were designed to investigate the current approaches taken in Brazil and in the UK. Despite the ex nsive findings of strengths in dyslexia, it appears that companies are still greatly lacking in their knowledge of Positive Dyslexia, and in particular the potential benefits of “talent managing” their dyslexic employees. Study 3 assessed companies’\r\nperspectives and attitudes towards dyslexic candidates and employees. Senior and high-level personnel from SME to multinationals were interviewed in Brazil and in the U.K. An overall lack of awareness about Positive Dyslexia was identified within the workplace, whilst a reasonable knowledge of the conventional definition of dyslexia was apparent in the sample group used from the U.K. In the Brazilian sample, both the overall awareness about dyslexia and any specific knowledge about Positive Dyslexia knowledge was non-existent. In Study 4, a quantitative research study was carried out to understand the perspective of dyslexic employees as to disclosure of their dyslexia in the workplace. The major result was that of the identification of a positive significant relationship between a company’s senior executive’s disclosure of dyslexia and the acceptability from younger dyslexic individuals to follow suit. In summary, all of the studies show clear implications for the dyslexic employee’s lifetime in a company, from appointment\r\nto talent management.",

Most explanations of EF reflect some degree of self-regulation as applied to cognition, emotion, behavior, adaptive functioning, and even moral reasoning and choice. In line with this, multiple models have been proposed to account for and explain the range of capacities and acts that represent EF, although the predominant models are adult-centric, and as a result, less applicable to thinking about EF developmentally. It is difficult to ignore the fact that nearly every neuropsychological evaluation in the clinical setting reveals and then attempts to address some aspect of executive dysfunction (EdF). EF deficits have a significant impact in multiple domains of a person's life and the lives of others around them, including parents, teachers, siblings, and peers. The pervasive and at times quite impairing nature of EdF calls for attention and emphasis from researchers and clinicians alike.",

      "title": "What can performance tell us about learning? Explicating a troubled concept",
      "abstract": "The notion of “performance7rdquo; has a central place in the contemporary discourse of learning and competence. The notion is used to translate abstract ideas and ideals of lifelong learning, organizational learning, learning society, etc., into practical measures. Changes in performance provide the identifiable measures that learning has taken place, evidence of enhanced competency/capability. Different versions of the learning and competency/capability agenda may place different emphases upon the extent to which such performance changes may be predetermined or are essentially emergent, but the assumption remains that performance provides the basis for attribution that learning has (or has not) taken place. This article takes issue with the conventional notion of “performance” as unequivocally observable. Drawing upon traditional philosophical distinctions between behaviour and action, and interpretative, constructionist, situational, and relational traditions within the social sciences, the nature of performance is subjected to theoretical analysis. It is argued that performance cannot be taken as transparent evidence of learning. Rather the attribution of performance is itself the outcome of situated acts of interpretation, essentially contestable and negotiated, subject to reinterpretation and renegotiation. The key social processes by which such interpretation is accomplished will be shown to implicate issues of identity (and identity formation) and social practice (and its discursive production). The potential fruitfulness of the identity-practice model will be illustrated by applying it to the issue of graduate “employability”, in order to address problems with the conventional “skills” approach.",

      "title": "Defying some difficulties of the assessment of several generic competences",
      "abstract": "A reference to concepts, procedures and attitudes and also to acquisition of capacities was frequent when\r\npeople were interchanging opinions about the aspects that could be evaluated in a university-level student.\r\nNow, we speak in terms of competences: there are specific competences, generic competences,. Just\r\ntrying to speak about them is a hard job; to obtain competences will represent an enormous challenge. It’s\r\nimportant to mention the extensive difficulty to find a common definition of the word competence. One\r\nof the many meanings is: the knowledge needed to do something, the knowledge needed to do something\r\nwith people, the knowledge needed to do something with criteria, the knowledge of when and why is\r\nnecessary to do something. Common elements to the numerous definitions are the references to: a set of\r\nconceptual knowledge, the procedures and the attitudes, feasibility in its learning with recurrent training,\r\nan explanation on its attainment in the action, its use in an efficient work and a necessary context.\r\nSome of the reasons used for the work by the competences in the educative sphere are the overcoming of\r\nthe design based on content, the integration of diverse intelligences, the advance towards a unification of\r\nthe areas of the knowledge, the true connection with a final applicability of the education in the work. A\r\nformation in competences demands several experiences that integrate knowledge and the practical design\r\nto apply these experiences – including several (and/or many) of them -, selecting and preparing the\r\ndiverse scenes that promote them. One of the objectives of the hands-on session is to explain and to\r\ndiscuss about this kind of experiences, practical designs and stages.\r\nEven with all their limitations, the conventional tools have been useful for an evaluation of the degree of\r\nassimilation of the concepts and the capacities; nevertheless, the task is much more arduous - and with\r\nless explicit experience transmissible and transmitted - when a person moves in the reach of the\r\nevaluation in values and attitudes, and of the evaluation of the competitions located within a profile. In\r\norder to evaluate competences, the educational team defines evidences. This task must be done in team\r\nfor many reasons. For example, the fact that many competences transfer the borders of the concrete\r\nterritory in which an individual professor moves. The mentioned evidences will have to be pertinent,\r\nexcellent, adapted and realistic.\r\nOften, to elaborate a scheme of the knowledge associated to each competence will identify diverse\r\npossibilities to demonstrate the possession of this competence through its development in a practical\r\nframe. Nevertheless, some competences (or some groups of competences) can be resisted to the previous\r\npractice.

      "abstract": "Mental health is an integral part of the overall health of an individual. It is not just the nonexistence of any mental disorder but also includes one's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects our lives to a great extent by having an impact on the way we feel, act, and perceive. It is vital to pay attention to mental health as is the case with maintaining physical health to work constructively and to realize one's potential. Apart from depression, stress, and anxiety, there are several other types of mental disorders prevailing like Personality disorders, Psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and many more. Anyone can become a victim of a mental issue irrespective of gender, age, profession, and standard of living. Such issues must be predicted in advance to accelerate the process of diagnosing the problem so as to enhance the quality of life of the patient. Many such predictive models have been implemented with the help of algorithms associated with modern domains such as machine learning, deep learning, image processing, voice detection, and many more. This study aims at providing a comparative study of the works that have already been done in this domain and to find the best algorithm to predict mental illness thereby taking appropriate actions to combat such issues.",

Classes of situations in which executive functions are required include novel tasks and situations that require concentration, planning, problem solving, coordination, change, conscious choices among alternatives, or overriding a strong internal or external pull. Component cognitive abilities that constitute what collectively is known as executive function include the following: inhibition, that is, the ability to ignore distraction and stay focused, and to resist making one response and instead make another; working memory, that is, the ability to hold information in mind and manipulate it; cognitive flexibility, that is, the ability to switch perspectives flexibly, focus of attention, or response mappings. These abilities are crucial to all forms of cognitive performance. The ability to inhibit attention to distractors makes possible selective and sustained attention.",

      "abstract": "How does repeated or chronic childhood adversity shape social and cognitive abilities? According to the prevailing deficit model, children from high-stress backgrounds are at risk for impairments in learning and behavior, and the intervention goal is to prevent, reduce, or repair the damage. Missing from this deficit approach is an attempt to leverage the unique strengths and abilities that develop in response to high-stress environments. Evolutionary-developmental models emphasize the coherent, functional changes that occur in response to stress over the life course. Research in birds, rodents, and humans suggests that developmental exposures to stress can improve forms of attention, perception, learning, memory, and problem solving that are ecologically relevant in harsh-unpredictable environments (as per the specialization hypothesis). Many of these skills and abilities, moreover, are primarily manifest in currently stressful contexts where they would provide the greatest fitness-relevant advantages (as per the sensitization hypothesis). This perspective supports an alternative adaptation-based approach to resilience that converges on a central question: \"What are the attention, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making strategies that are enhanced through exposures to childhood adversity?\" At an applied level, this approach focuses on how we can work with, rather than against, these strengths to promote success in education, employment, and civic life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Design thinking fundamentally relies on abductive reasoning. Diverse thinking types such as divergent thinking, systems thinking, and empathetic thinking have been adopted in design thinking education. Yet, it is very rare to address abductive reasoning to be integrated in a design thinking course because of deductive validity and inductive strength. In practice, the quality of design thinking is judged from design outcomes in terms of creativity and innovation rather than the application of abductive reasoning in thinking that is necessary for educators to develop diverse instructional strategies for design thinking. Through a design thinking experiment where abductive reasoning was structured for groups of students to modify their chosen fairy stories by challenging identified lessons/values/beliefs, we articulated relevant strategies from case analysis. As a result, we discovered the following six strategies for abductive reasoning: questioning on socially given identity; restructuring a hierarchy of values; de‐ and re‐contextualisation; perspective‐taking; being intersubjective through body swapping; and developing imaginative empathy for compassion. The six strategies support pedagogical aspects of design thinking such as collaborative problem‐solving and analytic and empathetic engagement; and thus, design educators can use them in developing instructional strategies to facilitate abductive reasoning in design thinking.",

In making inferences, observers utilize schematically organized knowledge and tendencies to react which they have acquired, either through experiences which are common to everyone as they grow up, or as result of particular individual experiences and training. Thus some inferences and judgements are closely similar in different individuals, while others show marked individual differences.

      "abstract": "A 4-decade long research program that had started out focusing on creative genius unexpectedly produced a general response typology potentially applicable to the average person on the street. In particular, attempts to define both creativity and noncreativity resulted in an eightfold typology of everyday human thought and behavior. Given any situation that may evoke a response, the alternative outcomes can be distinguished according to their initial probability, actual utility, and the person's prior knowledge of that utility. These 3 parameters then yield 8 major types of outcomes: (a) routine, reproductive, or habitual responses (based on acquired life and work expertise); (b) fortuitous responses (such as uninformed response biases); (c) irrational perseveration (or failing to learn from past mistakes); (d) problem finding (such as violations of expert expectations); (e) irrational suppression (refusing to do what's good for you); (f) creative or productive thoughts and behaviors (original, useful, and surprising responses); (g) rational suppression (such as those due to previous response extinction); and (h) mind wandering and behavioral exploration (such as fantasy, tinkering, and play). These distinct responses exhibit important interrelationships. For example, although habitual responses are antithetical to creative thought and behavior, creativity is fostered by problem finding, rational suppression, and mind wandering or behavioral exploration. Moreover, because the 3 parameters can assume continuous values between 0 and 1 inclusively, the typology allows for more finely differentiated thoughts and behaviors, including “satisficing” decisions that fall short of utility optimization as well as tentative hunches residing between absolute ignorance and certain knowledge.",

Contrasted with crystallized intelligence , or an individual's culturally acquired knowledge, fluid intelligence is a broad and overarching concept that involves multiple cognitive skills such as inductive reasoning, comparing relations, and abstracting, and is correlated with working memory and cognitive control. Tests intended to assess fluid reasoning, such as progressive matrices or figure classification, are often visual–spatial. Conceptual models of fluid intelligence are reviewed, together with alternative views.

An important distinction regarding control over mind-wandering that is often made in mindfulness training programs is attempting to suppress thoughts versus allowing thoughts to pass away without elaborating, judging, or analyzing them. For instance, using standardized measures of academic performance, some research teams have observed improvements after a brief mindfulness intervention. Many published mindfulness interventions do already include extensive didactic instruction of various mindsets related to mindfulness. However, mindfulness training may also influence mind-wandering and academic achievement indirectly by reducing levels of negative affect or by changing students' mindsets about their ability to control their attention. Strategies for reducing mind-wandering have immense practical significance given the robust relationship between mind-wandering and impaired task performance. Achieving stable improvements in mind-wandering may therefore require both an adaptive mindset as well as practices that enhance attentional control.",

El presente trabajo pretende delimitar dicha noción, haciéndolo desde el marco teórico y epistemológico conductual.

This chapter presents embodied practices that underscore how disorientation productively shifts our perspective from a focus on visibility and stability to a sensibility energized by proprioception and instability. In addition, it traces the implications of shifting orientations, getting lost, embracing the unforeseen, and moving in between states of knowing and unknowing. The practice of dwelling in the unforeseen requires a tolerance for ambiguity and conjures a state of being that is at once open to the world around us and grounded in our own sensory experience. Certain physical practices can train for a psychic tolerance for chaos, confusion, being off-balance or feeling uncomfortable—paving the way to respond to disorientation with curiosity rather than reacting with fear.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with creativity as a psychological means of pedagogical creativeness.This paper states that future teachers of technical subjects should reasonably consider not only isolated technical or pedagogical creativeness development, but also their organic integration as the bases of teacher training skill formation, to some extent characterized by creativity.The creativity term is defied as well as determined with divergent and convergent thinking.This research focuses on the fact that convergent thinking is the kind of thinking usually associated with problem solving or intelligent skills.Additional definition of convergent thinking represents solving any other type of problem referred to get a right answer.This term is opposed with divergent thinking, when a person develops a new and original way of thinking that may contain a number of possible problem solutions.This paper describes the key basic characteristics of creativity, in particular the speed, originality, flexibility, sensitivity, metaphoricity etc. Moreover this article analyzes the interrelation of intelligent skills and creativity.Certain permissible level of intelligence corresponds to any profession.Individuals who have IQ below this level can not master a particular profession.If intelligent skills are higher than the lowest permissible level, there is no direct correlation between intelligence and achievements.A high level of intelligence causes the higher levels of creative abilities and vice versa.People who have high intelligent skills and low creativity are the victims of the traditional education system aimed to provide students with the maximum of ready made knowledge.The development of student creative skills is mostly influenced with the creative professional teacher activity.Simultaneously in the process of creative professional teacher working his / her creative skills are revealed, implemented and developed.Under such conditions, it is necessary for teachers to be aware that their own creative professional education activities are in need.Teachers should also analyze their own teaching experience and implement pedagogical experience of other leading experts, taking into account their creative individuality.",

      "abstract": "The assessment of intellectual ability is a core competency in psychology. The results of intelligence tests have many potential implications and are used frequently as the basis for decisions about educational placements, eligibility for various services, and admission to specific groups. Given the importance of intelligence test scores, accurate test administration and scoring are essential; yet there is evidence of unacceptably high rates of examiner error. This paper discusses competency and postgraduate training in intelligence testing and presents a training model for postgraduate psychology students. The model aims to achieve high levels of competency in intelligence testing through a structured method of training, practice and feedback that incorporates peer support, self-reflection and multiple methods for evaluating competency.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of «personal maturity» and «professional maturity» are often used in the literature, which are not identical since they describe different psychological realities. Personal maturity is defined by the authors as a key new formation of age, which radically changes the previous social situation of development, as a psychological new formation. That is, professional maturity may be a relatively autonomous entity that does not necessarily correlate with personal growth. Personal maturity is characterized by a process of internal personal transformation, the source of which is the individual's need for self-actualization and sense of identity. Autonomy is determined as the most important feature. Personal maturity within the functional approach framework is considered as a self-regulatory system, where the main function is the transformation (regulation) of the ontogenetic development process into a purposeful, systemic, personality-given process that acquires individual features in the means, conditions and purposes of this development. It is known that the effectiveness of socio-pedagogical activities largely depends on the level of training, theoretical knowledge and practical skills of the teacher, one’s skills and abilities to establish contact with the student. In our opinion, the best indicator of the quality of socio-pedagogical training, primarily, is the effective implementation of future professional activities. We believe that the criterion for ensuring the effective performance of professional duties is a high level of future teacher’s socio-professional maturity development. Social maturity consists of individual components like any complex, integral phenomenon. Certain states of personality that accompany one’s activities in various spheres of public life act as such components. There are many approaches in the scientific literature to building the structure of social maturity and to identifying the components that are of most importance and play the role of «supporting element» of the «core» of social maturity.",

      "title": "Evidence-based training of wisdom in business and management: Use of scientific insights about malleability of practical wisdom for rigorous interventions",
      "abstract": "Cultivation of practical wisdom in business depends on understanding of malleability of wisdom-related characteristics. Recent experimental evidence suggests dramatic malleability in core features of wisdom, which has implications for assessment as well as external and personal training. The present chapter aims to provide a systematic review of evidence concerning the malleability of critical features of practical wisdom – intellectual humility, consideration of change, as well as perspective-taking and integration. A particular focus is devoted to the role of situational factors in inhibiting or promoting practical wisdom. Results indicate that social contexts (e.g., being together with friends/work-colleagues) promote more practical wisdom than non-social situations, self-focused contexts inhibit practical wisdom, and contexts promoting ego-decentered mindsets (e.g., self-distancing) sustain practical wisdom in self-focused situations. Within-person (state) differences in wisdom across situations are at least as large if not larger than between-person (trait) differences. Insights about the malleability of practical wisdom also resulted in a novel state-sensitive approach to measure practical wisdom across both state and trait-level, allowing for ecological measurement of meta-cognitive processes in a cost-efficient and reliable fashion. The chapter concludes with speculation about implications for evidence-based intervention programs to foster practical wisdom in people’s lives.",

The mentally retarded, influenced by the same set of learning variables that influence and control much of the behavior of all humans, can experience a wide range of learning difficulties and deficits. The treatment or behavior change approach is an educational one. If a person is experiencing difficulty, he is presenting symptoms of a poor educational experience. The retarded may exhibit too much behavior in terms of general environmental requirements. Excessive behavior patterns are quite likely to be labeled as deviant or pathological by the social environment. Because of the apparent visibility of such behaviors, it is easy to notice conflict with or deviation from standards of conduct.",

The definition of goal priming is different from priming due to other psychological representations. Unconscious goal priming is able to induce motivational behavior and the effect of priming cue does not fade over time. The independent variables of goal priming are related to the subject's psychological states and the influence from others. The dependent variables of goal priming are related to the performances of tasks and the social relationships. The perception-behavior model, behavior choice model, evaluation preparing model and affect factors model explain the psychological mechanism of goal priming from the perspectives of unconscious and goal. Unconscious goal priming can be applied to a wide range of fields such as business, education and health care.

Independence is a complex process, demanding not only the example but also own and very often verified experiences.

Independence allows then for asking questions concerning oneself, own place among others, and these always stay in a close bond to own identity. In special education the subject of identity gain greater significance. Pedagogues concentrate mainly on language expression and on actions, by which disabled are expressing themselves. More important become examining if undertaken educational actions allow disabled to perceive themselves as independent individuals.

      "title": "The Effectiveness of the Psycho-Nutritional Intervention Approach (PNIA) in Enhancing Functional Independence, Psychological Well-being, and Quality of Life in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "The rapid increase in the world’s older population has forced health systems to ask a difficult question: how should aging be approached when survival alone is no longer enough? For most of the twentieth century, the emphasis was on pharmacological treatment and the management of chronic disease. That model saved lives, but it also left many problems unsolved loss of independence, social withdrawal, and emotional decline remained largely untouched. In recent years, a different view has gained ground. Aging, it is argued, should be treated not simply as a biological process but as a lived experience shaped by mind, body, and community. The Psycho-Nutritional Intervention Approach (PNIA) is an attempt to respond to this broader challenge. It draws together strands that have usually been kept separate: psychological counseling, a largely plant-based diet informed by sattvic principles, yoga and controlled breathing practices, mindfulness meditation, and creative activities such as music and cognitively stimulating games. None of these methods is new; each has its own literature. What distinguishes PNIA is the deliberate attempt to bind them into a single, practical framework that can be applied in community and clinical settings. This paper considers how PNIA may influence daily functioning, emotional resilience, and cognitive stability in older adults. To capture these effects, well-established geriatric tools are proposed, including the Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living, the Lawton–Brody scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Early pilot programs and wellness camps, though modest in scale and not without their limitations, suggest encouraging results. Participants frequently reported greater ease in self-care, brighter mood, and a renewed sense of social connection. Taken together, these observations indicate that PNIA may offer more than symptom relief. By combining modern gerontological insights with traditional Eastern practices, it opens the possibility of viewing old age not simply as decline but as a stage in which resilience, meaning, and new forms of growth can still be cultivated.",

We present and build on historical and current perspectives that point toward the centrality of well-being (e.g., Psychology of Working, Critical Studies, Humanitarian Work Psychology, Occupational Health Psychology, and Positive Organizational Scholarship). The complexification of the ultimate criterion for well-being includes multiple perspectives, domains, and levels that have synergies and tensions.

However, application of social skills training and approaches to the treatment of major psychiatric disorders is a challenge to the professionals working in the field of mental health. The present chapter focuses on the vital areas where mental health professionals need to focus with regard to building social skills while working with the persons recovering from mental disorders. Elucidating the very nature of the technique, it seeks to present social skills training as an essential and viable alternative to pharmacological treatment for treatment of persons with long term psychiatric illnesses. Person with social skill deficits, like an inability to express thoughts, feelings and emotions, arising either as part of the illness, or due to restriction of learning new opportunities to acquire, the chapter highlights how the technique can help the persons in treatment gain new social skills. Through case illustrations that entail the adoption of social skills as a technique, it elaborates the usage of the technique in holistic attempts to rehabilitate the client back into the mainstream of society.",

Mental enhancement not only facilitates peak performance, but it also empowers us to go anywhere and do anything with authority and conviction. Cognitively enabled employees have the necessary skills, knowledge, and ability to do their jobs. Unfortunately, few of us realize brain building is possible, or how to begin. Technically speaking, brain building is called cognitive skill development and has been in the psychology domain since the early 1960s. J. P. Guilford, eminent professor at University of Southern California, and a President of American Psychological Association, designed the Structure of Intellect, winning several prestigious awards for it. This intellectual model consisted of a cube of 126 different mental abilities. See J. P. Guilford & R. Hoepfner, 1971, The Analyses of Intelligence New York: McGraw Hill; R. J. Sternberg, 1991, Competence Considered, and 1992, Intellectual development, both Cambridge, MA: Yale University Press. Historically, cognitive skill improvement was isolated within progressive coastal school districts and Psychologists' private practices. Cognitive skill improvement was used successfully as a treatment in these arenas for learning and even psychological problems. Unfortunately, its use as a training tool was ignored, in spite of obvious work place implications. Most of us do not like to admit we have trouble processing information. We may feel insulted, and even become defensive at the very thought. However, we do not have to feel self-conscious about this type of self-improvement. Each of us is a unique individual, and information processing can vary 2 BEST COPY AWMLABLE across a considerable range from person to person. However, where possible, each of us should seek to optimize our mental abilities. Think of your mind as a valuable core aspect of your ability to be productive. Consider shaping it up, as you would fine-tune the engine of a sports car. Many, becoming aware that a way to speed up information processing exists, become enthusiastic about personal advancement and heightened work efficiency. It all boils down to getting more work done in less time, with less stress and effort. With the technical demands of the new century, and the elimination of training jobs because of new technologies, we should strengthen our brains and develop our own intellectual capital bank. Beginning: Understanding Our Brain Foundation. Unless our mental profiles are empirically tested, we can only guess what our individual strengths and weaknesses are. Psychologists and learning specialists are qualified to test and re-train cognitive skills on an individualized basis. However, formal testing evaluations are expensive and time consuming, so this becomes impossible for most of us. As a learning disability specialist, I tested and trained learning problems for years. Assessing specific learning difficulties, severe cases ADD, dyslexia, and ADHD, I wondered what the typical mental profile would be, and how it related to the workplace. It soon became evident. My clients from the general population soon included a wide array of people, from students, professionals, executives, engineers, the average employee, to athletes. I conducted many field tests with corporations and over a thousand students, as they are intact seated learning groups and do not travel on business missing training. I evaluated performance improvement change with nationally standardized cognitive skill measures and achievement tests. Although it is known we all have different learning style profiles, and there are more than fifty, I made some interesting discoveries.",

      "abstract": "Problem statement. The article presents the results of a theoretical study of the problem of emotional competence. It is shown that emotional competence is an important aspect of professional success. The formation and development of emotional competence of specialists allows them to achieve success in the professional sphere, and also allows to avoid psycho-emotional disorders and preserve mental ealth. Concepts of competence mainly focus on the mental processes that underlie the activity, on the knowledge that arises as a result of these processes and its organization, on conscious practice, or on talent or innate abilities. The processes that distinguish an expert from a novice include the following processes: planning, tracking, evaluation of problem solving, decision making. Experts and novices provide information differently; the former develop more complex strategies and activity monitoring than the latter. The success of professional activity also depends on personal qualities: a stable and positive system of relations with one's own inner and surrounding world, as well as the level of formation and development of emotional intelligence; specialists who better understand and manage their own emotions, adapt more easily to stressful and crisis conditions, are more proactive and responsible. The purpose of the article is to study the problem of emotional competence as the basis of professional success. Results of the research. Based on the above, we conclude that emotional competence can be considered as a psychological phenomenon that reflects the emotional maturity of an individual and summarizes the emotional, intellectual and regulatory components of the psyche involved in the process of achieving professional and personal goals. Emotional competence has such a significant impact on many aspects of a person's professional life and professional activities. The study of this problem helps to reveal the key mechanisms underlying professional success. The results of such studies can be used to develop education and training programs aimed at improving the emotional competence of employees, as well as to form a better understanding of how important it is to combine professional knowledge with the skills of effective interpersonal communication and interaction to achieve professional success.",

The framework presented, called the \"multiple systems model of reading\", views development as contingent cycles of construction and reconstruction that developmental resources at various levels of functioning (genetic, neural, psychological, behavioral, and environmental) contribute to. The model makes two key assumptions: (a) reading abilities are continuously distributed, and (b) the developmental process has distributed control; every observed outcome is jointly determined by multiple factors, including the developing organism itself. Ramifications of these assumptions for both research and educational practice are discussed. Educational practice is well served by respecting the complex, and sometimes idiosyncratic, nature of the developing organism, and by not allocating causal responsibility, or all the remedial efforts, of possible reading problems to any single cause.",

      "title": "Toward the study of the relationship between psychological defenses and psychosocial stress factors in modern foreign science",
      "abstract": "The phenomenon of psychological defenses is considered from the standpoint of various approaches (cognitive, psychodynamic, behavioral, etc.), to understanding this phenomenon. The novelty in the research of foreign authors of the first quarter of the 21st century is traced. Empirical studies of psychological defenses within the framework of the theory of “stress vaccination”, “minority stress” in connection with “distorted perception”, social control and psychological well-being are presented. The impact of social factors (stress, depression, etc.) on the development of immature psychological defenses in a person, which reduce the level of psychological well-being, the ability to cope with mental conditions and disorders, and the level of self-esteem, is relevant. In cases of gender discrimination, alienation (avoidance) is more often chosen, while stigmatization on some other grounds leads to self-condemnation, self-doubt, and depression. Separate studies are devoted to the negative consequences of the use of immature and neurotic psychological defenses, as a result of which positive results are devalued, and the task is perceived subjectively as more difficult, while the use of mature protective mechanisms increases the mental stability of the individual. A number of modern foreign studies are devoted to understanding psychological defenses as factors of recovery or degradation, for example, the interpretation of the mechanisms underlying depression as protective (“smoke detector”), and sleepwalking and night terrors as a causes of “failure” of more mature and adaptive psychological defenses. The latest research on the trigger of time and place in its relationship with the cognitive processes of a person experiencing a psychotic episode can provide a more favorable outcome on the path of recovery. The purpose of this work was to study the current directions of research on the problem of psychological protection in foreign publications of the late 20th — first quarter of the 21st century. The research methods were the analysis and structured presentation of literary sources of foreign authors on the problem of the phenomenon of psychological defenses in modern foreign science.",

      "title": "Reasoning Skills in Individuals with Mathematics Difficulties",
      "abstract": "Reasoning and mathematics skills are typically studied in separate literatures. Yet, these abilities are related at multiple levels. For example, understanding new concepts, selecting an appropriate strategy to solve a mathematics problem, or learning from feedback involves reasoning. There is also emerging evidence that the basic representations that underlie certain forms of reasoning and mathematics skills (e.g., ordering ability, creating a \"mental line\" representation, making comparisons) are overlapping. The main focus of this chapter is on how reasoning skills are affected by dyscalculia/mathematics difficulties, and how reasoning skills relate to mathematics performance. To address these questions, I first consider the cognitive profiles of individuals with dyscalculia. Dyscalculia is associated with a range of cognitive deficits (in working memory, long-term memory for order, spatial attention, etc.) that are not specific to the domain of numbers. It is essential to understand how cognitive abilities and resources might be affected in dyscalculia, as reasoning skills rely heavily on cognitive resources. I also give an overview of the various ways in which reasoning and mathematics abilities are related, and also consider the evidence regarding the extent to which reasoning abilities in individuals with mathematics difficulties are affected. These questions are important both from a theoretical and practical point of view, and one aim of the chapter is to highlight and discuss these implications. I also outline some important future directions for this line of work.",

      "abstract": "The concept of intelligence is usually conceived of and operationalized in terms of cognitive capacities—relatively fixed information processing operations that determine the efficiency with which preestablished goals are achieved. Intelligence, as operationalized in standardized assessment instruments, has not included the measurement of dispositions toward rational thought and behavior (i.e., the thought processes that fix beliefs proportionately to evidence and that maintain consistency among beliefs). This contrasts with the vernacular use of the term intelligence, which does subsume dispositions toward rationality. It is argued that educational researchers and social scientists should begin to consider the consequences of the discrepancy between scientific/professional and vernacular concepts of intelligence. In order to provoke thought about the discrepancy and the effects that it has on educational practice and social policy, it is proposed that the field consider the implications of a new psychological concept, dysrationalia: the inability to think and behave rationally despite adequate intelligence.",

In the modern world, a person can hardly achieve absolute health (for reasons of environmental violations, high-speed socio-psychological standards of self-realization). At the same time, the individual’s area of responsibility is the process of migration of health indicators on the “Health – Disease” continuum and its approach/removal to/from the “label/ label Health”. We are talking not only about systematic monitoring of biochemical health indicators, but also psychological facts indicating the direction of the health vector. Psychological health factors include automated negative verbalizations of attitudes, needs, motives, and values; irrational character traits and subsequent psycho-emotional states. Awareness and control of negative psycho-emotional states constitute the essence of the process of developing emotional intelligence.",

Limitations exist in the areas of accuracy, internality, and accessibility, as well as in the reliability and validity of available cognitive-behavioral assessments. Most assessments are not equipped to adequately take cultural considerations into account.

Asi, es posible encontrar diferentes enfoques, que se clasifican, principalmente, en modelos mixtos o de habilidad y tambien diferentes instrumentos que apresan el constructo.\nEn esta investigacion se pretende poner a prueba el modelo de inteligencia emocional de las cuatro ramas. Para ello, se llevaran a cabo dos investigaciones: En la primera de ellas, se comprobara la relacion entre la inteligencia emocional y las variables rendimiento academico, satisfaccion con la vida, realizacion de conductas de riesgo y apoyo social percibido y, en la segunda, se verificara si la inteligencia emocional se puede incrementar a traves de programas de entrenamiento. Esta potencial mejora se va a poner a prueba con dos entrenamientos, fundamentados en dos modelos diferentes de inteligencia emocional.\nEn la medida en que una validacion cruzada de resultados ayuda a una mayor generalizacion de los hallazgos encontrados, se realizaran las dos investigaciones en dos paises de habla hispana, Espana y Mexico. En la primera investigacion, participaran estudiantes universitarios y en la segunda, en Mexico, padres de ninos que acuden a una clinica de salud mental y, en Espana, profesorado no universitario.\nEsta tesis doctoral pone en cuestion el modelo de inteligencia emocional de las cuatro ramas.

      "abstract": "This paper reviews the recent literature on measuring and boosting cognitive and noncognitive skills. The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills – personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill.Character is a skill, not a trait. At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years.High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.",

      "abstract": "Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development. Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes. Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case. This research paper will focus on those challenges and problems which are more serious rendering them into genuine mental health concerns. An attempt will also be made at discussing and explaining how these mental health problems can be dealt with and managed, while acquainting you with the existing forms of psycho therapy and intervention which are used.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue, as a psychophysiological state, is a normal human condition experienced as a result of mental or physical activity that consumes one's biological resources. In order to relieve its symptoms and to restore human's ability to continue work, a return to a fresh, relaxed state is required. It is usually obtained by an adequate amount of rest and/or sleep, but under the presence of some disadvantageous factors, such as too hot or too cold microclimate, high levels of noise at a workplace, work overload, psychological stress, lack of motivation, and others, e.g., family or health-related problems, this needed amount of rest simply may not fit into a normal 24-hour cycle of activity, resulting in the fatigue built-up. A fatigued worker becomes prone to performance deterioration, loss of concentration, misjudgment of his/her environmental safety, hazardous behaviors, anxiety and sleepiness. Therefore, worker's fatigue management is essential for improving productivity and quality of work, as well as for building worker's satisfaction, motivation and overall wellbeing. To supervise fatigue, appropriate tools for its measurement are required. This paper presents an overview of existing methods of fatigue measurement, including psychological (self-reports and questionnaires), physiological (i.e., changes in various body functions), and performance related (e.g., reaction time, sensory abilities) ones.",

These effects are related to personal motivations to enhance learning, recovery, or hard work on the part of others. Most jobs involve dealing with people; for teachers, managers, salespeople, and others this is the main task. Socially unskilled managers produce high levels of discontent, and consequent absenteeism and labour turnover among their subordinates. All kinds of mental patients have social behaviour problems. Schizophrenics are the worst, and are found very difficult to interact with. Assertiveness, the ability to influence or control others, has sometimes been equated with social competence. The social moves or signals of the social skills model are partly non-verbal, and perception and feedback is partly of the non-verbal communication of others. Assertiveness and rewardingness require special non-verbal styles of voice, face and posture.",

For instance, despite much commercial interest in and a potentially huge market for successful gamification products in the areas of education and health, much of the excitement is still based on speculation, and reception in parts of the academic community remains sceptical. The chapter aims to collate observations from multiple empirical studies and meta-studies and collect and highlight issues that need to be resolved or mitigated for gamification to progress. Such issues include unclear definitions, a limitation on small sets of elements employed with unclear effects, unintentional side-effects of competition, a confusing variety of operationalizations, the erosion of intrinsic motivation through extrinsic incentives, a disconnect between theoretical understandings and practical realizations, a strong focus on a behaviorist paradigm, studies' mixed, partial, and inconclusive results, a lack of attention to moderating factors, and methodological limitations.",

Cognitive abilities are hierarchically organized, which implies that general cognitive ability predicts performance on most tasks that involves active information processing. Physical abilities show a less well-defined structure; these abilities tend to be relevant to more narrowly defined tasks. Personality traits (especially the Big-Five—Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) are most relevant to understanding interpersonal interactions. They are related to job performance, but this relationship is surprisingly weak. Interests are related to vocational choice, motivation, and satisfaction. Individual differences in core self-evaluations predict a willingness to take the initiative, to persevere, and to attempt to achieve challenging goals.",

Employing UDL means that the teacher will consider all young people beforehand, rather than during or after the lesson, ensuring that any concerns are addressed in the planning stages. Cognitive focuses on the challenge of the mind, thinking skills and decision-making. Whilst psychomotor looks specifically at what the body can do. Affective focuses on the social interaction between a team and the socialisation that takes part in discussions and talks on and off the pitch.

In Social Cognitive Theory, self-efficacy judgments function as one proximal determinant of four classes of psychological processes: Selection Processes, Cognitive Processes, Motivational Processes, and Affective Processes. A central question in any theory of the cognitive regulation of motivation and action is the issue of causality. Progress in psychology, however, has often been impeded by measurement tools that are far from optimal. In the assessment of personal determinants of sociocognitive functioning, investigators commonly have chosen to employ omnibus tests. Self-efficacy judgments are elements of a dynamic system of self-beliefs. A wide variety of interventions, conducted in diverse psychosocial settings, have been shown to affect people's beliefs in their efficacy to handle the challenges of everyday life.",

Deficits in ECFs are common and result in specific behavioral and affective impairments that impact an individual’s cognition and ability to participate in rehabilitation. Irritability, mood swings, disorganization, apathy, indifference, and inattention are some of the manifestations of ECF deficits. Impaired ECFs due to head injury, stroke, disease process, or normal aging challenges both physical and cognitive rehabilitation. For effective rehabilitation treatment and discharge planning, it is essential for the practitioner to anticipate and recognize impaired ECFs in the client. In this chapter, we will discuss definitions of ECF, its anatomical correlates, the assessment of ECF, behavior associated with ECF impairment, and issues related to cognitive rehabilitation.",

These problems are usually settled by an intellectualist argument: to perform an action is mainly to execute decisions, to carry out plans or intentions, or to follow instructions. According to that view, cognition produces action, but it does not take place in the accomplishment of action itself Such an intellectualist view has been taken up again and developed by recent trends in cognitive science. Why focus on such a view? Because, by its systematizing of current assumptions in most of (he theories of action, it makes the conceptual framework of those theories very clear and allows one to see the inconsistencies of its underpinning. The alternative view outlined in this paper is based on an externalist and pragmatic conception of mind. It considers cognition as a social process and reintegrates it into the performance of situated actions. To do so, it grasps performance as a genuine praxis and specifies the thinking and reflection which animate it in relation to the phenomenon of 'embodied agency.'",

In the pubblic mind, often, this skill is directly related to the ability to act in a prosocial, or moral, way. Clinical literature shows us that some neural deficits and psychological disorders can actually cause a significant lack of empathic ability and therefore the implementation of socially maladaptive behaviours, even criminal. However, there are also some diagnostic categories characterised by failure to “put yourself in another’s shoes”, but patients don’t usually act in an antisocial way; then, not all the criminals meet the criteria for psychiatric diagnosis. So, the question is: only low levels of empathy leads to antisocial behaviours? And if so, does therapeutic interventions for empathic skill entail moral enhancement? The present work aim to answer to all those issues through a multilevel and cross-discilplinary analysis of psychology, neurosciences and philosophy literature.",

From this viewpoint, self-regulation involves more than metacognitive knowledge and skill, it involves an underlying sense of self-efficacy and personal agency and the motivational and behavioral processes to put these self beliefs into effect. Views of self-regulated learning that do not include this core self-referential system have difficulty explaining human failures to self-regulate, especially when such efforts are known metacognitively to be helpful. To explain students' self-regulation failures as well as their successes in naturalistic settings, educational psychologists need to expand their views of self-regulation beyond metacognitive trait, ability, or stage formulations and begin treating it as a complex interactive process involving social, motivational, and behavioral components. Such a perspective reveals not only the complexity of self-regulation but also the human side of it-the role of our self-doubts, false beliefs, unfortunate self-monitoring, and strategy choice dilemmas.",

El objetivo de esta investigacion fue describir el rol autopercibido del psicologo: las tareas, dificultades y las competencias requeridas en sus diferentes ambitos de desempeno profesional. Para esto, se realizaron entrevistas semi-estructuradas a 20 psicologos que se desempenan en distintas areas de la profesion. Se aplico un analisis de contenido a nivel descriptivo, encontrandose principalmente que el rol autopercibido es: i) difuso y confuso o bien flexible y amplio; ii) tiene como mision promover el bienestar de las personas; iii) varia en funcion del contexto de actuacion. Se observan limitaciones en las relaciones con el entorno e interpersonales, ademas de la necesidad de fortalecer el desarrollo de competencias generales como la comunicacion oral e interpersonal, y especificas como comprension teorica, investigacion cientifica y evaluacion.",

It has evolved with improvements in technology such as advanced computer systems and brain imaging systems, which have spurred the growth of neuroscience. As the number of tools for research in the field grows, the sophistication and complexity of models have grown. However, a unique characteristic of mathematical psychology is its potential role in all branches of psychology. All “substantive” areas of psychology (e.g., clinical, social, and developmental) could have both empirical and mathematical foundations.

Social competence involves the ability to interact with and make judgements about other people. Whether someone can correctly write a cheque, for example, depends on instrumental competence; whether someone has good judgement about when and to whom cheques should be written depends on social competence. This distinction, although intuitively obvious to most clinicians, has not been fully developed either in research or practice settings, despite having a sound basis in neuroscience. A clinically useful assessment of competence should include instrumental competence and social competence, as well as adequate and systematic exploration of individual issues of context. Assessment methods and preliminary data on new social competency measures for older adults will be presented.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the role of perceptual knowledge (knowledge by acquaintance) in the development of expertise in professional contexts.It seeks to answer the question as to how, if at all, does heightened knowledge by acquaintance inform a high level of professional know-how?In many professional contexts, successful action requires the articulation of various epistemic capacities: to draw on relevant systematic knowledge, to understand the nature of the problem faced, to perceive the essentials in complex situations and to judge and then to act appropriately.The aim will be to bring together philosophical and empirical considerations to show how best to understand the ability to perceive the essentials in complex situations and how this ability bears on the ability to judge and to act appropriately in professional contexts. 1 II. Perception Plays a Different Role in Different Language Games.It is through acting on and reacting to our environment, natural and social, that we acquire perceptual concepts.We acquire them in a social milieu in which we learn to recognise and speak about those things in our environment that affect and interest us.The language games that we thus learn to participate in concern relatively permanent features of our environment, shared with others (Strawson 1961).The concepts that we possess of substances, processes, events and other people are acquired through action and observation, but necessarily also through learning our native language through interaction with adults.Perceptual concepts are acquired through social intercourse, rather than through introspection and labelling.They are made manifest through our attempts to communicate and to act on the world.They grow through our participation in normative activities (Baker and Hacker 1985) in which adults play a predominant role.We also acquire psychological concepts and concepts of sensation through the same means, but our acquisition of sensation concepts depends on our prior grasp of perceptual concepts.We learn about colour, texture, solidity, viscosity etc. through 1 The distinction between judging and acting in a professional situation is made to take account of 'knowing to' examples (see Wiggins 2012 for examples).",

Perhaps it seems intractable, yet related research has intensified in the social sciences during the last 30 years. Wisdom—the opposite of foolishness—is the application of knowledge in pursuit of well-being and the common good. It involves balancing intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal factors in the context of short- and long-term horizons. In one study of consumer choices, those rated wiser exhibited evidence of strong personal intentions, prudent deliberation, and a clear linkage from values and knowledge to action, each of which the wisdom literature features. Students in high school or in university business programs can engage with complex cases, moral dilemmas, and everyday problems in which they are tasked with applying wisdom components for deriving more constructive and uplifting solutions.",

In spite of the successes achieved, or perhaps in light of them, several issues have become important in implementing or evaluating behavior modification programs. It is frequently assumed that if staff perform appropriately, consequences that follow their behavior will maintain the behaviors. This is probably a naive view of the natural contingencies and their power in shaping staff behavior.

      "abstract": "Students are motivated by the desire to satisfy their personal needs to achieve certain individual goals and aspirations. Motivation can vary according to interactions between internal factors (such as individual needs, interests, and values) and external factors. The most difficult practical problem is to understand the nature and quality of motivation in the classroom. Metaphors can help students understand and integrate information in an easier and more meaningful way. A substantial part of Social Psychology stems from the belief that social behaviors are based on people's perception of reality. Learning styles derive from four bipolar dimensions' (David, 2015, p. 204): extravert-introvert, which refers to the capacity to assimilate and analyze information through social interaction. Adolescence is marked by fluctuating levels of self-esteem and the adoption of different attitudes and styles until it stabilizes in youth and adulthood. Willpower comes into play at this stage, representing the subjective and most crucial aspect of self-regulation. Procrastination is often used as a way to cope with anxiety arising from initiating or completing tasks. The origins of the term can be traced back to the Latin word 'pregetare,' meaning to delay, hesitate, or postpone.",

Whilst this might seem to offer opportunities for psychology, their chosen method – self‐report questionnaires – is problematic. Happiness questionnaires are troubled by problems of definition, introspection, memory and insight; their population‐level summation is grossly inaccurate as a representation of everyday emotional experience; and both their reliability and their validity might be better accounted for as products of their ability to model, rather than to measure, psychological processes. Psychology therefore runs the risk of discrediting itself if it becomes too closely associated with these initiatives.",

The research method used is library research with content analysis techniques. The results of the study show that as a religious psychologist, Zakiah Daradjat sees spirituality as mental therapy. Mental health is the ability to adjust to yourself, with other people and society and the environment in which he lives. To form a healthy mentality in addition to adjusting, as well as calmness of life, knowing psychiatric disorders / mental illness, spiritual and Islamic education which includes family education, school, society. In his opinion Indeed the peace of life, peace of mind or inner happiness, does not depend much on external factors such as social, economic, political, customary habits and as such; but more depends on the way and attitude to face these factors. So what determines calmness and happiness of life is mental health. Mental health is what determines a person's response to a problem, and his ability to adjust. Mental health is what determines whether people will have the excitement to live or be passive and lackluster. While mental care through creating a relationship between the consultant and the child, accepting the child seriously, forgiving the child (tolerance), knowing the feelings of the child and then reflecting his head, still respecting the child, the child who leads him in the treatment sessions, may not scramble for treatment, and limit restrictions.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Various types of errors are shown in a mentally retarded boy (CA 12:10, Tanaka‐Binet IQ 45–50) engaging in a standardized arithmetic achievement test for first‐grade pupils. The following issues on behavioral characteristics of the mentally retarded with arithmetic tasks are discussed from a special educational point of view. 1. Production of correct solutions depends heavily on self‐regulation, motivation and metacognition levels of the retarded with arithmetic tasks. Therefore, maintaing appropriate levels of these processes is a fundamental principle in encouraging the mentally retarded to do their best. 2. How the retarded deal with a task on figures depends on how the figures appear to them. It is a perceptual problem rather than an arithmetic one. 3. While the retarded can do well on a task by manipulating the objects in question in his daily life, they cannot solve the same task in an achievement test situation. They attempt to solve a task using a familiar strategy and are difficult to change the one used. They adopt a known strategy with a clue of particular word, phrase or part of story to deal with the tasks. 4. Realization of how to use the counting principles develops step by step, but understanding process of every principle on cardinal progression is one thing and that on multiple progression is another.",

Vocational services such as supported employment (SE) have helped people with severe and persistent mental illness to obtain community-based competitive jobs by finding them appropriate opportunities, often with accommodations and supportive services. SE is now regarded as an evidence- based practice. Related cognitive impairments in emotion recognition, theory of mind, attention, memory and executive function can make it even more difficult for workers with a psychiatric disorder to understand accurately what is going on between themselves and their social environment at work. Regular feedback provides workers with a psychiatric disorder continual reassurance about what they are doing right as well as what they need to improve on. Studies published in industrial and organizational psychology and management journals strongly endorse work performance evaluations and feedback to improve productivity.

Assessing anticipatory behaviors leads to a better understanding of child development, providing clues to the development of a child’s cognitive skills. On a theoretical level, several questions arise. Does a child who anticipates necessarily understand the situation he is in, or does he merely make a perceptive association learned through conditioning? Can it be stated with certainty that a child who does not (or cannot) anticipate does not understand? In the case of a child’s typical development, anticipation is also one means for understanding atypical development, such as autism spectrum disorder. On a practical level, whatever the underlying explanation, anticipation deficit could be one interesting screening procedure for detecting developmental disorders as early as possible.",

Nustatyta, kad viena dažniausių problemų yra mokymosi sunkumai, sąlygoti išorinių veiksnių, pvz., neracionalių mokymosi krūvių, mokymosi priemonių stokos ir pan. Nemažiau svarbūs yra ir vidiniai veiksniai, pvz., nepakankamai išlavėję studento valingas dėmesys, suvokimas, kalba ir t.t., bei asmenybės ypatumai, charakterio bruožai.

In principle, exercise and cognition research has the potential to provide some advice concerning the association between physical activity (PA) and cognition. The term PA is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles through energy expenditure. The term \"cognition\" can be defined as \"any form of information processing, mental operation, or intellectual activity, such as thinking, reasoning, remembering, imagining, or learning\". Generally speaking, cognition includes both bottom-up and top-down cognitive processes. Physical activities differ in many ways, ranging from more energetically determined activities, such as aerobic or strength exercises, to more information-oriented activities, such as coordinative or dual-task exercises. The umbrella term Executive functions (EFs) refers to a multi-component construct that consists of several distinct, yet interrelated, processes, encompassing the cognitive processes responsible for controlling and organizing goal-directed behaviour.",

Every behaviour that blocks pedagogical efforts is perceived as “an unwanted behaviour ”. Unwanted behaviours affect the lesson and the whole class negatively and stop us from achieving our goals. The effort, time and money spent for the educational purpose will go for nothing ultimately.These unwanted behaviours may arise from the class structure, the teacher or from the students. One of the reasons arising from the student is that of a biological reason. These are mentioned as brain damage, disease, malnutrition due to biochemicals and they have affect on unwanted behaivours. One of the unwanted behaviours is the hyperactive attitudes of the hyperactive children. Disease, nutrition, nerval, neurological condition, temper, genetic disorders, physical diabilities, variables like medication inclines to hyperactivity with some kids. The teachers who don’t know how to react to hyperactive behaviours will not be able to estimate the incidents that may happen in the future Thus unwanted incidents may be experienced. In this study Reşat Nuri Güntekin’s novel Ò‚alõkuşu” has been reviewed on recognition of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by applying the bibliotherapy method. The heroine of the novel Feride was detected to have The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Hyperactive-Impulsive Type according to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) diagnostic criteria. The educational administrators and the candidate teachers can be informed about the disease of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by reviewing the ‚alõkuşu novel, applying the bibliotherapy method.

But the prolonged stress is likely to reduce the efficiency of a person. Adolescence is the age of stress and storm. Rapid body changes and heightened emotionality characterize this stage of human development. And when the adolescents face additional stress in their family, school and social environment, what is the combined effect of all this psychological distress?

      "title": "How to Integrate Neuroethics into a Neuroscience Course – And Drive Student Engagement with Core Concepts",
      "abstract": "Students are thinking about ethical, moral, and societal implications of science-as individuals and communities- regardless of whether these topics are part of formal curricula. Ethical questions can arise from broad neuroscientific questions (What is consciousness?), emerging topics (e.g., synthetic biological intelligence), neurotechnologies (e.g., human brain organoids), and respective intersections (Could brain organoids be intelligent or conscious?). As a field of scholarship, the ethics of brain science, or 'neuroethics', can help students to situate what they are learning in the classroom within a broader socio-philosophical context that advances critical and ethical reasoning toward future neuroscience research or technologies. I will argue that neuroethics can also enhance student situational interest and cognitive engagement with core neuroscientific concepts that align with core learning objectives. Yet faculty face challenges when incorporating neuroethics topics into courses, which may include, but are not limited to i) lack of disciplinary expertise, ii) time or resource constraints within courses, or iii) the perceived lack of value in formally including ethics instructional content in courses focused on core concepts in neuroscience education. This Opinion article aims to demonstrate how these challenges can be overcome. I describe how the Value Reappraisal Model can be used as a process theory to guide integration of neuroethics into neuroscience curricula. My autoethnographic account of developing and teaching a new course provides a case study for faculty who are interested in creating curricular opportunities for students to engage with ethical issues by fostering deeper learning and appreciation of core concepts in neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this research is to define different kinds of means for testing of the understanding of a listened audio-text, such as non-verbal means, verbal ones and reproductive means. Methods of the research. There were used the following general scientific methods: the method of induction, deduction, analysis and synthesis, comparative and descriptive methods and explanatory ones. The results of the research. There were proposed the tasks for pupils at the lessons of a foreign language, updated the psychological mechanism of the cumulative feature of recognition, which allowed us quickly, almost simultaneously formulate for each person a new task and to do its co-image and recognize it in a view of that new design. It was shown that recognition itself did not become a problem for the pupil, because that problem would be determined the significance of the task itself. However, such a possibility itself in terms of tremendous perception of some task is quite questionable, but, at the same time, the pupil performs this task. This psychological mechanism is the mechanism of sinibularity. It was shown that sinibularity was a mechanism that actualized the similarity, compatibility of objects according to their individual components, details, features. It is the basis for the formation of associative chains and it is one of the factors that forms the concept. The sinibular associative chain is a mono-modal mental construction that will be created due to the identical features of different concepts of each object. The fixation of sinibular relations is based on the possibility of recognizing the object not only taking into account the pattern, but also understanding its individual details; irradiation of the significance of the object on its basic features and the peculiarities of their restructuring affects is based on some features, and the presence of form-semantic connections facilitate the connection of external features of the object with its internal qualities, properties and characteristics. Conclusions. The psychological mechanism of sinibularity provides pupils with the solution of linguistic problems and tasks at the lessons of a foreign language by updating basic four components of the philological consciousness of the person: the identification of features (or characteristics) of a certain lexical or grammatical structure; the range of variations of their significance in the paradigm of this group of linguistic units (so-called objective concept); the level of acceptability of this variation; the differentiation of this concept, etc.",

Indeed, it is frequently configured as an impediment to timekeeping, a thorn in the side of consciousness, a drag on intentional action, and a brake on decision-making. Reality, however, is complex. While distraction can interfere with timing, anxiety, memory, error, and fatigue, it can also be exploited under controlled conditions to enhance performance by helping the performer to maintain an open cognitive and physical responsiveness to the world and a pragmatic mode of engagement with the task at hand. Indeed, distraction ensures that the performer is in close contact cognitively and socially with the full phenomenological plenitude of sound, thereby contributing to performance’s transformative value as a way of accumulating social capital in everyday life.",

La forma de enfrentarse a situaciones dificiles e incontrolables dependera de que tan preparada se sienta la persona para hacerlo, es decir, que tan autoeficaz sea. Las investigaciones sobre autoeficacia muestran que el lograr una meta de forma exitosa depende en gran medida de que tan capaz se sienta uno mismo para lograrlo y no tanto en funcion de las verdaderas capacidades que tenga, ya que mientras mas capaz se sienta, hara mayores esfuerzos e invertira mas tiempo, lo que lo llevara a terminar la tarea exitosamente.

      "abstract": "Abstract. The ever-changing ideals of modern society often tend to set too bold goals based on theoretical knowledge that can lead to great results. All these can have negative influences on mental health, characterized by a high degree of stress, exaggerated emotional reactions, reduced cognitive activity, inappropriate behaviors in the educational and social environment. Under these conditions, the practice of physical activities can be the optimal alternative for primary school pupils in order to eliminate the mental tension accumulated during the theoretical classes held in the classroom. We can say that through these activities pupils can develop their ability to adapt to various conditions, thus being able to control the emotions that appear as a consequence of the harmful influences of a civilization characterized by nervous exhaustion. Physical activity, practiced in different forms can put condition on the multidimensional development of the human being, because physical exercise develops and trains. The practice of motor activities on medium and long term, has a esential role in maintaining an optimal state of health, in promoting the sets of values, behavioral, social and personal attitudes. The purpose of this research is to find out through a questionnaire, what are the options for pupils in primary education. The questionnaire will highlight issues regarding the way of conducting the physical education class and whether it manages to increase the level of satisfaction, generating a state of relaxation and good mood.",

      "title": "Optimizing Cognitive Load in Instructional Simulations and Games",
      "abstract": "Instructional simulation and games are usually used as substitutes for actual equipment, processes, real-life problems, and social situations. They allow observing outcomes of different learner actions and steps without involving actual hardware and people. They also provide environments for practicing important skills in an efficient (in terms of cost and time) way. From a cognitive load perspective, using actual equipment or human actors may not necessarily lead to the acquisition of expected knowledge and skills. High cognitive load involved in operating the equipment itself, performing required procedures, interacting with other people, especially when allowed time is constrained, may inhibit learning. In such high load situations, limited cognitive resources would be left for actual learning. Instructional simulations and games allow modeling such processes without time limitations and other cognitive constrains. Instructional simulations may also allow representing abstract knowledge structures and processes that are difficult to observe in real conditions. They may enhance the development of abstract thinking and problemsolving skills by offering environments for exploring and testing hypotheses. Many available instructional simulations and games represent mostly exploratory learning environments with limited guidance for learners.

      "title": "Optimizing Cognitive Load in Instructional Simulations and Games",
      "abstract": "Instructional simulation and games are usually used as substitutes for actual equipment, processes, real-life problems, and social situations. They allow observing outcomes of different learner actions and steps without involving actual hardware and people. They also provide environments for practicing important skills in an efficient (in terms of cost and time) way. From a cognitive load perspective, using actual equipment or human actors may not necessarily lead to the acquisition of expected knowledge and skills. High cognitive load involved in operating the equipment itself, performing required procedures, interacting with other people, especially when allowed time is constrained, may inhibit learning. In such high load situations, limited cognitive resources would be left for actual learning. Instructional simulations and games allow modeling such processes without time limitations and other cognitive constrains. Instructional simulations may also allow representing abstract knowledge structures and processes that are difficult to observe in real conditions. They may enhance the development of abstract thinking and problemsolving skills by offering environments for exploring and testing hypotheses. Many available instructional simulations and games represent mostly exploratory learning environments with limited guidance for learners. From a cognitive load perspective, any random exploratory or search procedures may impose excessive levels of working memory load thus interfering with meaningful learning (see Chapter II for more details about basic principles of cognitive load theory). Therefore, optimizing levels of instructional guidance represents the most important means of managing cognitive load and enhancing learning outcomes in such environments.

Emotional intelligence tests are published in scientific and popular literature but it is not always obvious whether they measure namely intelligence or, however, a definite set of personality traits. The authors have made an attempt to create a measure for diagnostics of emotional intelligence as an ability to solve divergent and specific tasks which are concerned with emotions. As a result of several stages of experts' evaluation a set of questions has been formed which were approved in a pilot study which revealed the existence of gender specificity and no professional specificity of emotional intelligence. Two groups of schoolchildren were compared with respect to the mentioned indices: the first of which studied according to a profound curriculum in some subjects and the other one studied according to the general curriculum. The differences between the two groups were obtained in respect to all of the mentioned phenomena. Part of them is evidence to a better sociopsychological adaptation of schoolchildren from specialized classes whereas the other differences stand for a higher level of adaptation of children with special educational needs who study in usual classes. The obtained results allow formulating practical recommendations on how to increase the level of socio",

      "abstract": "The rapid pace of everyday life, as well as the life filled with stressful situations, everyday obligations, challenges and expectations, leads to a disturbance of tranquility, stability, comfortableness in people and in the most difficult case, disturbance of their state of health in different types. In the face of such a situation, social services emerge to help in the most productive way. Starting from the fact that human behavior is truly complex, social work is broad and uses numerous practice theories at different levels. Theory, in essence, refers to interconnected and systemically related groups of concepts and statements, which are organized in order to clarify relations on certain aspects. Social work may not have developed its own theory, but it successfully uses theories from other scientific disciplines. In order to have success in the realization of the social activities, it is necessary to have a ratio in theory and practice, because working without one of them is impossible. To be successful and effective in their work, social workers use a range of theories, working models and concepts with their clients, adapting them to their needs. It should be noted that social workers have the main role in providing customer assistance, and that is why they will occupy an important place in this paper. Contently we will try to give a concise explanation of the theories of social work and theories for social work, as well as the great responsibility of social workers who face daily challenges in this sphere.",

Each decision making process produces a final choice and the output will be an action or an opinion of choice (Decision Making). Decision making is, however, only a step in planning, even when it is taken quickly, with little thoughts and information or when it effects action for few minutes only. Everyone takes decision daily in his life for every course of action. Seldom there is a chance to judge a course of action in isolation, as every decision has to gear up other plans. In public organization consensus can be a goal, not a mandate for public decision-making. Public policies are the mixture of our values and opinions, technical knowledge and abilities, and political set up. These are the views often conflict with one another, but when they differ from the individual views, generate disregard for the opinions and perspectives of others.",

Personal belief about capabilities to complete the task successfully show the behavioral choices, persistance, perforamnce and attitude. It helps to explain why people differ widely even having same knowledge, skills and abilities. Will I succeed or fail? Will I be liked or laughed at? Should I do it or not? Answers of these questions are based on personal efficacy (competence). Expectations of success or failure at a particular task is influenced by the sense of self-efficay in that area. High self-efficacy students engage in more effective self-regulatory strategies at each level of ability. High self-efficacy has been demonstrated by high academic achievement. On the contrary, low self-efficay destroy the personality that leads to anxiety, depression and other negative traits. Some low self-efficacious students give up on or never begin a task that leads to failure. 264 students of secondary classes from private and government high schools of Rawalpindi were randomly selected to administer a self-prepared 21 item Likert scale. Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient was applied by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results showed that academic achievement was associated with sense of self-efficacy. Self-efficacious students are competent to approach difficult tasks to take mastery. High self-efficacious students show their competency as they put required effort to get their targets. They are able to solve even more difficult problems. Self-efficacy increases the self competency among students.",

Het redeneren over andermans denken is noodzakelijk in sociale interacties, om het gedrag van anderen te begrijpen. In tegenstelling tot andere studies, die impliceren dat ‘sociaal redeneren’ complex is en gelimiteerd door cognitieve capaciteiten, laten wij zien dat mensen beter kunnen worden in deze vaardigheid. Cognitieve limieten verdwijnen door simpele ingrepen, zoals stapsgewijs trainen, visuele ondersteuning en het stellen van vragen. Ons onderzoek laat tevens zien dat suboptimale uitkomsten in sociale interacties soms te wijten zijn aan het gebruik van verkeerde strategieen. Simpele ingrepen kunnen ook hier uitkomst zijn: door mensen te helpen betere strategieen te ontdekken en toepassen. De belangrijkste bevinding van dit proefschrift is dat mensen sociale interacties daadwerkelijk interpreteren in termen van andermans denken, ook al is een niet-mentale interpretatie die formeel equivalent is, mogelijk. Zo wordt een rationale computer opponent niet hetzelfde behandeld als een equivalent mechaniek, ook al is de uitkomst in beide situaties hetzelfde. Bovendien is het spelen van een spel vanuit het perspectief van een ander moeilijker dan het spelen van datzelfde spel vanuit het eigen perspectief. Met andere woorden, sociaal redeneren gaat echt over andermans denken. Als zodanig, is het een unieke cognitieve vaardigheid.",

'Dealing with the external world' means complex and differentiated perception and internalization, particularly, subjectively relevant and meaningful activity: all this describes the individual learning and achievement behaviour of the child with a physical disablement. 'Achievement' becomes a category of high subjective significance, which requires constant intersubjective recognition. Motor behaviour as an objectifyable phenomenon must be distinguished from personal motor activity, at however limited a level of constitutional and functional motor competency it may occur. Expectation of success, and the avoidance of failure, are intrinsic constituents of educational reality in dealing with a physically disabled child. As Krappmann puts it, the achievement the individual must accomplish as a condition for enabling his participation in communication processes to occur, is designated as the category of identity.",

Mutual explanation and mutual understanding of facts, suggestions, ideas, concepts are error-relevant building blocks of knowledge work in teams. The better these special forms of teaching (explaining) and learning (understanding) succeed, the greater the chances of avoiding errors appear. Accordingly, it is suggested to view knowledge work from a learning and teaching perspective and to support it with instruments from didactics.

      "abstract": "Aims and objectives. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate and discuss previous research on emotional intelligence with specific focus on empirical and epistemological perspectives. Background. The concept of emotional intelligence is derived from extensive research and theory about thoughts, feelings and abilities that, prior to 1990, were considered to be unrelated phenomena. Today, emotional intelligence attracts growing interest worldwide, contributing to critical reflection as well as to various educational, health and occupational outcomes. Method. Systematic review. Findings. The findings revealed that the epistemological tradition of natural science is the most frequently used and that, therefore, few articles related to humanistic sciences or philosophical perspectives were found. There is no agreement as to whether emotional intelligence is an individual ability, non‐cognitive skill, capability or competence. One important finding is that, regardless of the theoretical framework used, researchers agree that emotional intelligence embraces emotional awareness in relation to self and others, professional efficiency and emotional management. There have been some interesting theoretical frameworks that relate emotional intelligence to stress and mental health within different contexts. Emotional learning and maturation processes, i.e. personal growth and development in the area of emotional intelligence, are central to professional competence. Conclusions. There is no doubt that the research on emotional intelligence is scarce and still at the developmental stage. Clinical questions pertaining to the nursing profession should be developed with focus on personal qualities of relevance to nursing practice. Different approaches are needed in order to further expand the theoretical, empirical and philosophical foundation of this important and enigmatic concept. Relevance to clinical practice. Emotional intelligence may have implications for health promotion and quality of working life within nursing. Emotional intelligence seems to lead to more positive attitudes, greater adaptability, improved relationships and increased orientation towards positive values.",

      "title": "Understanding Academic Creativity: An Application Of “Flow” Concept In Spiritual Perspective",
      "abstract": "In general sense academic output is measured in terms of grades obtained by students taking a particular course or with the level of understanding generated while undergoing the course. The output in terms of A grades is quite easy to comprehend, although, holds little value, the deeper understanding of the course holds much merit, although, it’s very difficult to comprehend. It is seldom reckoned how creatively a particular course is conceived, designed, delivered and helped to serve the academic fraternity. We try to demonstrate our understanding in all the spheres of our life, in action oriented thoughts, in perception about events, in interaction with the environmental stimulus. We sometime get bored with the mundane routine activities, but, sometimes quite get involved and absorbed in the process. Why particular tasks become mundane to somebody, while it absorbs somebody? Is it creative stimulus? Is it environment stimulus? Is it the personality traits? Is it the subject itself? Being creative in one’s profession often holds its objective treatment to the concept of creativity which is understood to be an expression of the individual talent in a form which is not controlled by the individual itself; rather it is understood to be performed by somebody who is beyond the individual. It may sound little bit tiring and confusing to understand that “being absent” is basically “being present” in a form where the expression of inner understanding happens when one allows the “Flow”. The concept of “Flow” as proposed by Csikszentmihalyi is understood in a perspective where the optimal experience of an individual towards the context of intrinsic motivation and positive experience (Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi, 2002) is influenced by the individual interaction of person and the environment. “Flow” is also influenced by certain characteristics of motivation, happiness, satisfaction, strength and positive emotions involved in the process where the “Flow” of an individual is enhanced and not obstructed by certain forces (Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre, 1989). The study setting involves academicians from a top level Institute of National Importance engaged in different Engineering, Social Science and Management streams to understand the “Flow”. Primarily observation method along with semi structured questions is employed to understand the responses of the individual, where the responses were allowed to express itself without any obstruction. Responses were gathered in an informal setting so that the respondents may not become aware and try to be politically correct. The findings can be effectively used to design policy intervention at an individual level to cull out the creative genius from a person.",

Personality disorder research and personality science itself demonstrate that dysfunctions in two skills—self‐monitoring and mindreading—worsen self‐regulation and lead individuals to fail chronically to achieve goals in the social domain.

Learner tasks considered as autonomous would include solving problems by oneself, raising new ones, and any activity carried out without the presence or collaboration of others. However, beyond these examples, there has been no development of the behaviouristic criteria for identifying a type of learning as autonomous and distinguishing it from another, non-autonomous type. The present work aims to help to delimit this notion, doing so within a behavioural epistemological framework. Assuming that the use of a term establishes its meanings, we analyze the way the term autonomous learning is normally employed, and derive several relevant aspects for the wanted definition.",

      "abstract": "In our study on the identification of giftedness the role of intellectual and non-intellectual factors and their relation to each other are being investigated in the development of giftedness. We think that non-intellectual factors (positive personality traits, motivation, interest, etc.) do not predict giftedness in themselves but they are absolutely necessary in the actualisation of abilities. We presume that in some cases (“late-bloomers”, unequal development of intellectual, emotional and social factors) it is some personality characteristic that might play a decisive role in helping to foster the intellectual development. In this way the fact that the teacher notices some positive personality traits (strong internal control, responsibility, wide range of interests, strength of will etc.) and evaluates the child positively even if s/he does not really have good achievement, yet, can enhance the chance for later development.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Individual and Group Life Skills Training on Shyness among Adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONShyness is a common but little-understood emotion. Shyness is not a mental disorder. Common sense indicates that Shyness is a behaviour pattern characterized by inhibition in some situations. Shyness may be defined experientially as discomfort and/or inhibition in interpersonal situations that interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. It is a form of excessive self-focus, a preoccupation with one's thoughts, feelings and physical reactions. Situational shyness involves experiencing the symptoms of shyness in specific social performance situations but not incorporating it into one's self-concept. Shyness reactions can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive, affective, physiological and behavioral, and may be triggered by a wide variety of arousal cues.According to various statistics, around 40 to 50 percent of the people (and sometimes more) are involved in shyness. Shyness leads to lowered self-esteem and decreased self concept (D'Souza, 2005), increased fear reactions among adolescents and college students (D'Souza et al., 2006; D'Souza, 2007), decreased levels of happiness (Sreeshakumar et al., 2007), increased maladjustment among college students (D'Souza, Ramaswamy, Rangaiah, 2008). It was also observed that shy adolescents require specific guidance in educational and social areas (D'Souza, Urs, and Jayaraju, 2008). Shyness is not just one or two symptoms but an all-encompassing collection of characteristic that manifests itself in the mind, body and behavior of shy people (D'Souza, 2005).Regarding large number of the shy students and relationship of shyness with other various problems like anxiety and depression and its negative influence, applying effective methods to reduce shyness seemed to be necessary. The lack of such method will increase the negative effects on shy students especially on their personality and social communication. The key to converting shyness into something positive is to develop life skills that will diminish the effect or impact of such a feeling or condition in our life. The present study adopted Individual and Group Life Skills training to reduce the shyness among adolescents.METHODParticipantsParticipants were selected through screening of more than 500 adolescents for shyness. Only those adolescents who had high levels of shyness were considered for the present study. The researcher selected 96 shy adolescent students and divided them into 3 groups (32 each), LSTI and LSTG and control group and in each group there were equal number of male and female adolescents were randomly distributed.MEASURESShyness Assessment Test (D'Souza, 2006).The shyness assessment test for adolscents was developed by D'Souza (2006) of University of Mysore. It consists of 54 items and requires the subject to indicate his/her response by marking Yes, or No. or can't say. The items in the test pertain to three domains of shyness- Cognitive/Affective, Physiological and Action oriented. The reliability index ascertained by split half (odd-even) method and Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the scale as a whole were found to be 0.735 and 0.812 respectively.PROCEDUREThe entire procedure consisted of 3 phases: Screening/Pre test, LST Intervention and Post test.Phase IScreening/pre test: In the first phase, the researcher administered the shyness assessment test to a large sample (more than 500). Only those participants who had high degree of shyness and had shown willingness to the investigation were selected for the study. The main author selected 96 adolescents having high degree of shyness (81 and above), 48 boys and 48 girls. Further, those 96 students were randomly divided LSTI and LSTG and control group.Phase IILST Intervention: After the selection, treatment was given to subjects (individually and group) for 8 session for 60 days. After the introduction, the researcher explained about the LST programme. …",

      "abstract": "Prium non nocere or ‘‘First, do no harm’’ is traditionally associated with the Hippocratic oath that medical doctors take. The premise of this quote is that no matter what end result you are attempting to achieve, whether it be curing a patient or educating a child, your first consideration should be that no harm be done in pursuit of the goal. When this is applied to the special education classroom, mandatory high-stakes testing for students with intellectual disabilities violates this principle on many levels. According to the American Association on Mental Retardation website, the definition of mental retardation, another term for intellectual disabilities, is A disability characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills. This disability originates before 18. [There are five assumptions essential to the application of this definition]: 1. Limitations in present functioning must be considered within the context of community environments typical of the individual’s age, peers, and culture. 2. Valid assessment considers cultural and linguistic diversity as well as differences in communication, sensory, motor, and behavioral factors. 3. Within an individual, limitations often coexist with strengths.",

Despite decades of calls for their abolishment and more strength-based understandings of neurodiversity, no compelling alternatives yet exist. In this article, we illustrate and differentiate behaviour currently associated with attention disorder labels of ADHD and CDS. Extending our existing spacetime attention framework within process-based therapy theory we model ADHD and CDS-related traits as lower attention retention and selection over multiple tasks and goals. With the assumption spacetime attention fluctuations dictate the direction and duration of relational development, we provide a more nuanced understanding of how attention changes may affect functional, meaningful outcomes across different contexts and success criteria. As examples, attention moving away from uncomfortable internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, and emotions) may prevent suppression and regain mindful, present moment attention; attention moving internally may help creativity and encourage more meaningful actions. We then provide practical recommendations for assessment and holistic support for clients struggling with inattention within acceptance-based psychology practice.",

Related to instrumental aids, bodily endurance and external causes, vulnerability was found to be a ubiquitous primer in everyday decision‐making. The disabled individual's interpretative framework for risk and vulnerability is shaped by objectifying his/her own body, and by being accustomed to everything taking a long time.

      "title": "Learning and Developing Motor Skills in the Case of Secondary School Pupils with Mild Mental Impairment",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe motor skill represents the qualitative trait of learned motor acts and can be defined as automatized component of the voluntary motor act, a motor act or action which, through exercise, has reached a high degree of stability, precision, efficiency, which ensure the success of the execution to the desired effect (Herczeg, 2005). Starting from this definition, we ask ourselves the question: in what ways can motor skills be learned and solidified in the case of mental impairments? What happens in the case of mild mental impairments, with an IQ between 50 and 69? Are there significant differences in the learning process? We ask these questions knowing that the maximum level of development of a person suffering from mild mental impairment is that of a 12 year old, who theoretically will be able to conduct independent activities in his/her later social development, start a family and develop socially; as concerns the level of cognition and skills, these too can be developed up to a certain point.Intellectual deficit is insufficiency of mental effectiveness, which represents one of the important clinical aspects of a mental deficiency, determining the incapacity of the subject to respond in an adapted way to the demands of the environment (Bloch H., Chemama R., 2006). Intellectual deficiency is not a disease (even if it can be a consequence of one), but it is a different way of mental functioning and organization (Paunescu C., 1976, 1977).There are differences between intellectual handicap and mental handicap: mental handicap constitutes pathology of organization and functionality..., while intellectual handicap has a normal mental organization, but one when faced with a pathogenic aggression or overload cannot overtake certain limits of adapting or learning. (Paunescu C, Musu I., 1997)In this case, assisted learning, the one in which the pupil can profit from assistance and support, is most indicated and starts from the idea that the area of the proximate development (VIgotsky, 1978) allows a certain degree of improvement. It is about a certain phase in learning in which the pupil can profit from assistance and support. The lower threshold of this area is the one in which the pupil exercises an ability (already gained) independently. The upper threshold refers to the accomplishment of a (new) task with support from another person. Guiding the learning process towards the area of proximate development mainly presumes going through three stages: starting from the incapacity to solve the problem to its solving with support and then to independently solving the problem.The present study will analyse the connection between mild mental impairments and basic (target throwing) as well as specific (hoop throwing) motor skills. We chose these basic skills because they require, besides precision, attention and concentration. The motor skills are related to physical activity (Butcher& Eaton, 1989, Fisher et al, 2005, Wrotniak et al, 2006). In order to accomplish the objectives, pupils with mild mental impairments will learn the algorithms of throwing (target or hoop) by concentrating on aiming towards the hoop or the circle by arm-eye-target coordination or just arm-eye and later eye-target coordination. Motor learning is of a better quality when a cognitive treatment of the information is conducted by the subject, even by pupils with a limited IQ; this is why we aim to analyse the condition of the IQ's limitations on motor intelligence.The purpose of the paper is to analyse the correlation between the pupils' IQs and their results at target and hoop throwing.Research hypothesisMild mental impairment is not responsible for a better or worse acquisition of basic or specific motor skills. However, using preparatory games leads to a reduction of the time span necessary for the initiation and fixation of the basic technical elements from basketball.Material and methodsThe experiment was conducted during the two semester of the 2011-2012 scholastic year, at the Educational Centre for Inclusive Education Constantin Paunescu from Recas. …",

      "title": "A Seven Step Problem-Solving Method for School Psychologists.",
      "abstract": "School psychologists must become better acquainted with basic principles of applying and communicating psychological interventions if they are to be accepted in the school setting. Psychological interventions are often ignored or improperly applied by school staff and parents, who perceive them as difficult, of little value, or inappropriate for a particular school setting. Thus it becomes the burden of the psychologist to communicate complex ideas and expected outcomes. School psychologists need to understand how change occurs in complex settings, how to find professional literature that deals with change, and how to incorporate these ideas and techniques into the actual practice of psychology in the school. Delivery of psychological services in schools is suggested as a series of steps: (1) define and clarify the problem; (2) analyze the forces impinging on the problem; (3) discuss alternative strategies; (4) evaluate and choose among alternative strategies; (5) specify consultee and consultant responsibilities; (6) implement the chosen strategy; and (7) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Actual problem solving rarely follows discrete steps, and communication (genuineness, listening and encouraging consultee verbalizations, empathy, paraphrasing, continuation, etc.) is essential. Lewin's Field Theory is used as a framework for conceptualizing change in schools, and its tenets are applied to the steps in delivering psychological services. Contains 29 references.

      "title": "Thinking and curriculum",
      "abstract": "Exploring thinking It is interesting wonder about situations and consider whether thinking is involved in each, and when it is, what forms of thinking are involved, and whether they are significant education. Consider following: solving a mathematics problem, following a recipe, doing dishes, writing a story, remembering a past event, feeling sorry for someone, watching a sunset, listening music, and breathing. All these involve conscious, subconscious or unconscious brain processing, but whether they involve thinking depends on how one defines thinking--in particular, whether only conscious brain processing should be considered in that definition. For me, it seems difficult separate conscious and nonconscious thinking. Nonconscious thinking can be made conscious with development of awareness (which itself can be considered be a form of thinking). Thinking within education more often has a focus on critical, creative or metacognitive. While these might provide starting points for trying define thinking, it is difficult categorise situations, such as those above, in terms of these forms. thinking is not limited these forms, and different forms often overlap in any single activity. I would like define thinking as continuous multitask processing that is inherent in every aspect of our existing, knowing and doing while we are alive. I do appreciate, however, practicality of a definition of thinking for education that limits it conscious aspects of such processing. Traditionally, from a theoretical perspective, brain has often been compared a machine with inputs and outputs. From a systems approach, it is more appropriate, as Minsky (as cited in Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991) explains, consider brain as using its processes change itself--which means that processes cannot be separated from products. For example, brains make memories, which change subsequent thinking. such a view of brain makes no mention of representation, and reflects operational closure in which the results of its processes are those processes themselves (Varela et al., 1991, p. 139). Thinking also links with philosophy and its three cornerstones: being (ontology), knowing (epistemology) and acting (ethics). Some philosophers give these different weightings, but I see them as interrelated aspects of thinking that are all relevant in domains in which we function (for example, physical, personal, social, ecological and abstract domains). I concur with statement that to live is know (Maturana & Varela, 1987, p. 174), and, for me, this implies that living/ being, knowing/learning and acting/doing are all inseparably linked with thinking. One can extend my notion of thinking and ask, Does an animal, plant, a stone and world itself think? Philosophers such as Spinoza saw thought as an inherent aspect of substance (Stevenson, 2005, p. 163) and this notion has appeal for many deep ecological philosophers (Naess, 2008, pp. 230-251). For me, it is not only people who are in a state of being, knowing and acting (and I consider animals and plants be complex, emerging living systems that are self-organising, comprised of subsystems and nested within bigger systems such as cultures and societies) but it is whether they think or not that is problematic. My view is that more is needed than just traditional views of thinking when considering school curriculum. I see a need include personal, social, cultural and ecosystem thinking. Justifying thinking in education While we think all time, and we learn think without being taught do so, our thinking skills can be improved. If this is seen as desirable, then considering it from an educational perspective requires a change of focus within schools. Such a change needs be justified from numerous perspectives in order convince policy makers and educators support changes. …",

Methods: We included studies in English from various credible scientific databases, such as PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Results: People frequently encounter issues as a result of having unsupportive parents, dysfunctional families, societal pressure, and stressful life experiences. Individuals can improve their productivity and effectiveness by strengthening their Emotional intelligence. Conclusion: Youths’ low emotional intelligence has been linked to unpredictable emotional states and a suppressed capacity for emotional maturity, as a result, making an effort to acquire emotional intelligence will help one flourish and prosper in life.

There is another ability that has big contribution to determine the success, which is the ability to manage emotions well or emotional intelligence. It was found many cases which people have failed not because they lack of the potential for mastery of academic or technical skills but they lack of the skills to manage their emotions. Speaking about emotional intelligence, there are five things to consider: self-awareness, self control, motivation, empathy, and social skills. These five things work together in developing emotional intelligence. If emotional intelligence can be realized and well developed, it can be a benefit for students who are studying in universities. The hope is the systematic development of emotional intelligence will best promote student achievement in learning.",

      "abstract": "This article provides a review and conceptual comparison between self‐report and performance‐based measures of emotional intelligence. Analyses of reliability, psychometric properties, and various forms of validity lead to the conclusion that self‐report techniques measure a dispositional construct, that may have some predictive validity, but which is highly correlated with personality and independent of intelligence. Although seemingly more valid, performance‐based measures have certain limitations, especially when scored with reference to consensual norms, which leads to problems of skew and restriction of range. Scaling procedures may partially ameliorate these scoring weaknesses. Alternative approaches to scoring, such as expert judgement, also suffer problems since the nature of the requisite expertise is unclear. Use of experimental paradigms for studying individual differences in information‐processing may, however, inform expertise. Other difficulties for performance‐based measures include limited predictive and operational validity, restricting practical utility in organizational settings. Further research appears necessary before tests of E1 are suitable for making real‐life decisions about individuals.",

However, efforts to explain behavior in terms of EF have been hampered by an inadequate characterization of EF itself. What is the function that is accomplished by EF? The present analysis attempts to ground the construct of EF in an account of problem solving and thereby to integrate temporally and functionally distinct aspects of EF within a coherent framework. According to this problem-solving framework, EF is a macroconstruct that spans 4 phases of problem solving (representation, planning, execution, and evaluation). When analyzed into subfunctions, macroconstructs such as EF permit the integration of findings from disparate content domains, which are often studied in isolation from the broader context of reasoning and action. A review of the literature on the early development of EF reveals converging evidence for domain-general changes in all aspects of EF.",

Non-cognitive skills are the skills which fall outside of the traditional definitions of intelligence and are not measured on standardized tests. They are not specifically analytical in nature, but they include range of personality and motivational habits and attitudes like growth mindset, self-motivation, optimism, resiliency, adaptability, conscientiousness, self-efficacy, hope, and others. It is indeed commendable to see growing importance of non-cognitive skills as they are crucial predictors of growth in numerous life domains. This paper tries to identify five non-cognitive skills from detailed literature review and understand those skills with reference to their importance as predictors of entrepreneurs. There are certain cases which have been taken into consideration to understand non-cognitive skill as predictors towards entrepreneurship.",

      "title": "Problem Solving and Decision Making",
      "abstract": "Problem solving and decision making are both examples of complex, higher-order thinking. Both involve the assessment of the environment, the involvement of working memory or short-term memory, reliance on long term memory, effects of knowledge, and the application of heuristics to complete a behavior. A problem can be defined as an impasse or gap between a current state and a desired goal state. Problem solving is the set of cognitive operations that a person engages in to change the current state, to go beyond the impasse, and achieve a desired outcome. Problem solving involves the mental representation of the problem state and the manipulation of this representation in order to move closer to the goal. Problems can vary in complexity, abstraction, and how well defined (or not) the initial state and the goal state are. Research has generally approached problem solving by examining the behaviors and cognitive processes involved, and some work has examined problem solving using computational processes as well. Decision making is the process of selecting and choosing one action or behavior out of several alternatives. Like problem solving, decision making involves the coordination of memories and executive resources. Research on decision making has paid particular attention to the cognitive biases that account for suboptimal decisions and decisions that deviate from rationality. The current bibliography first outlines some general resources on the psychology of problem solving and decision making before examining each of these topics in detail. Specifically, this review covers cognitive, neuroscientific, and computational approaches to problem solving, as well as decision making models and cognitive heuristics and biases.",

      "title": "How does a pathologist make a diagnosis?",
      "abstract": "Abstract A pathologic diagnosis is the result of a complex series of activities, mastered by the pathologist. The nature of these activities is, however, rarely talked about in depth. The medical literature occasionally discusses aspects of the pathologic diagnosis processes, generally departing from the pathologic practice. The lack of a model makes discussions about the subject a matter of preference or personal style. Educational programs are largely based on the apprenticeship model, and the development of specific abilities rests on the personal aspects of both apprentice and mentor. A model for the pathologic diagnostic process is proposed. The process of diagnosis can be viewed as an action plan, encompassing 4 domains: (1) cognitive, (2) communicative, (3) normative, and (4) medical conduct. The cognitive domain involves processes of perception, attention, memory, search, hypothesis creation, and verification, among others. Communicative skills consist of providing arguments in support of a diagnostic conclusion, with adequate clinical and relevant pathologic information. Pathologic diagnosis is also subject to technical rules (based on empirical experiences), rules of rational choice (strategies aiming at definite goals), and consensual rules among peers. Finally, the pathologic diagnosis has to be evaluated in the sphere of medical conduct, from the perspectives of both the pathologist and the referring clinician. An understanding of the diagnostic process from a theoretic perspective will benefit pathology as a science and a medical specialty because it provides the basis for understanding diagnostic variations and discrepancies. Pathologic difficulties or errors can be mapped, allowing the institution of specific remedies. This model may also enhance training and educational strategies because specific emphasis can be directed toward a particular difficulty.",

Whatever is responsible for this different propensityin intelligence may also be responsible for the discrepancies in problem-solving techniques aswell as individual functionality. For example, some people are smart, gifted, creative andtalented, while others are inept, unimaginative and dull. Even among identical twins, differencesin their problem-solving skills are readily and unmistakably noticed. Can this be attributed tobiological, genetic or environmental factors? Researchers are overwhelmingly divided on thisissue. However, the component process theory focuses on the human mental developmentalprocesses as major determinant of the possible reason for the differences in cognitive abilities.This paper explores and synthesizes how our knowledge of the component process theory wouldhelp clinicians in their prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of mental or emotional disorders.",

Un aspecto que preocupa es que los niños parecen tener una actitud positiva hacia la ciencia, pero conforme avanza su escolaridad esa actitud disminuye gradualmente, así que su actitud al arribar a la secundaria ha cambiado hacia negativa, principalmente en las mujeres. Un primer escollo en la investigación de las actitudes es que no consisten en un constructo simple, sino de un conjunto extendido de pedazos y contribuciones que contribuyen singularmente hacia la actitud global individual: la percepción acerca del profesor; la ansiedad; el valor de la ciencia; el juego y la motivación, todas ellas de la ciencia o hacia la ciencia; las actitudes de los amigos; de los padres; la naturaleza del salón de clases; los logros o los fracasos académicos en la clase de ciencia.

Gamification has become a popular tool in several applications, including learning, since it provides a natural and attractive human experience. But learning is a complex and personalized process [2]. To succeed learning personalization, gamification should follow a player/user centred design. Moreover, gamification should identify the appropriate motivators of the target audience. To this result, the Self-determination Theory (SDT) is employed. SDT is concerned with the psychological needs behind motivation and the social conditions that foster these processes [3]. SDT identifies two distinct types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivators include the following: acceptance, curiosity, autonomy, competence, skill development, order, social contact. Extrinsic motivators include the following: badges, points, positive feedback, status, grades, fame. In this context, PYTHAGORAS project aims (among others) at exploring gamification impact for online and hybrid mathematics education.",

      "title": "Artificial intelligence capabilities in the context of the author's conception of creativity",
      "abstract": "The study provides some philosophical reflections on the creativity of artificial in-telligence. The study supposes that artificial intelligence can be considered creative only if it creates something new with help of imagination (or its equivalent) and ap-pealing to the so-called “background” (background and general knowledge, biases, competencies, experience, habits, intuition, prejudices, political preferences, skills, stereotypes, values, and others), and its creative activity must be either necessary or arbitrary. Necessary creative activity is related to the solution of specific tasks, for example, within the framework of technical invention or scientific discovery. Arbitrary creative activity is associated with spontaneous, aimless and inexpedient human activity. This type of creative activity takes place when a creative doer has free time, leisure, enthusiasm (hobby), plays a game or is bored. Based on the two types of creative activity, two types of creative artificial intelligence can be distinguished: a weak creative artificial intelligence that makes necessary creative activities related to the tool nature of artificial intelligence, specifically to effectively solving specific problems and tasks, and a strong creative artificial intelligence that makes arbitrary creative activities, that is, creates for the sake of creating alone. The strong creative artificial intelligence can be possible only if the artificial intelligence is given autono-my, the freedom to manage that autonomy, and learns to manage its freedom.",

      "title": "The Problem of Career Orientation and Reorientation",
      "abstract": "The article focuses on the problems of career orientation and reorientation. While noting that career guidance practiced in schools for a long time has been often confined to agitation, it is proposed to view the career guidance as a complex problem. It should benefit not only from the theories of pedagogy, but also psychology and sociology. The article gives a brief overview of the variety of these theories, distinguishing insights of individual scientists on the connection of the choice of profession with early childhood experiences, directedness of mental energy and needs (A. Roe), personality traits and environmental role (J.L. Holland, D.E. Super), the activities and plans for the future (E. Cinzberg). One of the parts of this integrated approach to career orientation certainly is the problem of professional re-orientation (conversion). Its occurrence depends on many difficulties experienced by students, related to the unrealistic choice, indeterminacy of fundamental values, skills, lack of steady motives, self-esteem, problems of adaptation, professional fitness.",

It is a skill that is central to human functioning, allowing individuals to navigate challenges, make decisions, and accomplish goals. Whether in everyday life or in more complex scenarios, problem solving is crucial for adapting to and overcoming obstacles. It involves identifying an issue, analyzing it, developing possible solutions, evaluating those solutions, and implementing the best course of action. This process is not only important for individuals but also for organizations, governments, and societies as a whole, influencing everything from economic decisions to technological innovations and interpersonal relationships. Definitions of Problem Solving At its core, problem solving refers to the mental and cognitive process through which individuals or groups work to find solutions to challenges or obstacles. This may involve resolving issues where the path to a solution is not immediately clear, requiring creative thinking, logic, and strategic planning.",

Irrelevant information can come from distracting stimuli in the environment, inappropriate response tendencies, and task‐irrelevant memories and thoughts.

      "abstract": "This paper suggests the potential of intelligence theory in guiding the development of educational programs for the mentally retarded. The Campione-Brown model is used to infer skills, states, and processes of trainable mentally retarded and profoundly mentally retarded children that are modifiable and to target objectives for educational interventions. The integration of components in the architectural and executive systems, such as perceptual efficiency, strategies, and knowledge states, represents functional intelligence. Trainable components of intelligence can serve as objectives in educational planning, while the identification of structural limitations leads to programming the environment to meet diminished efficiency or to developing support systems, such as self-instructional routines. In short, a reciprocal relationship is suggested for emerging theories of intelligence and changing educational practices.",

      "title": "Intellectual Styles",
      "abstract": "“Intellectual styles” refers to people’s preferred ways of processing information and dealing with cognitive and other tasks. Styles comprise an all-embracing way of understanding such constructs as cognitive styles, learning approaches, career personality types, thinking styles, teaching styles, and many others—constructs with or without the word “style.” The field of intellectual styles has a history of more than eight decades. Until the early 21st century, however, the field was constantly struggling with its identity as a result of three major challenges: (a) the lack of a common language and a conceptual framework with which work on styles could be understood, (b) the difficulty in distinguishing styles from intelligence/abilities and personality traits, and (c) the ambiguity concerning the link between work on styles and work in other fields. This identity crisis was exacerbated by three principal controversial issues regarding the nature of intellectual styles: whether styles are distinct constructs or similar constructs that overlap with one another but have different labels; whether styles represent traits or states, or whether they have elements of both; and whether styles are value free or value laden (i.e., some styles are more desirable than others in terms of human learning and performance). Over the years, the aforementioned difficulties inherent in intellectual styles impeded the progress of the field and confused both practitioners and the general public. Despite these and other difficulties, the field has flourished since the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Concerted attempts at theoretical conceptualizations have given some degree of unity to disparate bodies of literature. At the same time, tens of thousands of empirical investigations based on a wide range of style models and carried out in diverse populations across the globe have consistently demonstrated the critical roles that styles play in various domains of human lives. Undoubtedly, the existing literature has proved that intellectual styles are real, distinct psychological phenomena. Moreover, research findings have scientific value as well as practical implications for human learning and performance. Nevertheless, for the field to prosper further, several major limitations with the existing work must be overcome, and investigations that take into account the fast-changing world need to be initiated.",

      "title": "A Trace of Motivational Theory in Education through Attribution Theory, Self-Worth Theories and Self-Determination Theory",
      "abstract": "If motivation is the desire to act or move toward a particular activity, task or goal, just what influences one’s desire to do so remains complex. The impact of social context, or even just the perception of social context, can greatly influence what one attributes to their sense of self, as conveyed in attribution theory (AT), their perception of self-worth, as conveyed in self-worth theories (SWT) and subsequently their mindset and their behaviour to act, as conveyed in self-determination theory (SDT). Even more unclear is exactly what role the education system plays in fostering/hindering one’s motivation to learn. It is clear however, that the structure of the education system, the influence of educator’s actions and attitudes (whether deliberate or inadvertent), and the nature of peer competition can act as detrimental forces on the impact of one’s sense of ability and self. Educational policy that is created based on generalizations about universally innate human abilities, needs and drives, makes the question of how to foster intrinsically motivated students in schools even more challenging. Outside school programs such as Motivate Canada, which aim to foster motivation in youth by strengthening their self-confidence, and in-school programs, such as Inter-A, which aims to generate intrinsic, mastery orientated motivation, may not address all the complex factors underlying student motivation, but are a good start. Subsequently, motivational theories, despite their inconclusiveness provide hope that for students to grow into emotionally well-adjusted adults prepared to constructively contribute to our societies.",

      "title": "Radical neuroconstructivism: a framework to combine the how and what of teaching and learning?",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in pedagogical research have called attention to the dynamic nature of the teaching and learning process in which the actors mutually influence one another. The understanding of how this works in the brain—the specialized neural networks related to this process—is often limited to neuroscientists but are slowly becoming available to other learning scientists, including teachers. A transdisciplinary approach combining the best information about observable teaching-learning processes from education with newer information from the neurosciences may aid in resolving fundamental questions in the learning process. Teachers’ professional formation and development is often structured in segmented topical ways (e.g., pedagogy, evaluation, planning, classroom management, social–emotional learning), to identify important content knowledge (e.g., art, reading, mathematics, STEM), or to appreciate life skills (e.g., collaboration, critical thinking, social–emotional learning). While important, knowledge about the brain, the organ responsible for learning, is typically absent from teacher education. This paper reexamines the evidence from neuroconstructivism and the hierarchy of learning trajectories and combines it with evidence from psychology and the ways humans interact during the teaching-learning process to suggest radical neuroconstructivism as a framework within which to organize teachers’ professional development. The radical neuroconstructivism framework may contribute to making the content knowledge of teachers’ continual professional development more visible.",

      "title": "Intuition and Education",
      "abstract": "Intuition is a mode of consciousness wherein content is perceived by sudden, direct awareness. Intuition sees the wholes of things, perceiving patterns, and making connections. Intuitive awareness occurs to the conscious mind without any identifiable processing, cognitive or otherwise. The intuitive mode is useful for creativity, problem solving, decision making, and all forms of discovery. Scholars have addressed intuition in education by drawing attention to its possibilities for professional practice, and by theorizing how intuition can be harnessed to improve educational outcomes. Intuition offers an important balancing effect to the hegemony of rational analysis, but like everything to do with consciousness, its function is not well understood. Philosophers of education often conceptualize intuition as a form of expertise, relying on Gladwell’s Blink as a referent to the experience. But intuition encompasses a broader range of experience; so-called parapsychological experiences such as telepathic communication and pre-cognitive awarenesses are also common intuitive experiences and need more attention by educators. It is possible to learn to improve the intuitive function. Such training involves cultivating an acceptance of uncertainty and pursuing a depth of self-awareness so that intuitive content can be distinguished from projection, fear, and simple guesses.",

      "abstract": "Critical thinking is essential to a health professional's competence to assess, diagnose, and care for patients. Defined as the ability to apply higher-order cognitive skills (conceptualization, analysis, evaluation) and the disposition to be deliberate about thinking (being open-minded or intellectually honest) that lead to action that is logical and appropriate, critical thinking represents a \"meta-competency\" that transcends other knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors required in health care professions. Despite its importance, the developmental stages of critical thinking have not been delineated for nurses and physicians. As part of a task force of educators who considered different developmental stage theories, the authors have iteratively refined and proposed milestones in critical thinking. The attributes associated with unreflective, beginning, practicing, advanced, accomplished, and challenged critical thinkers are conceived as independent of an individual's level of training. Depending on circumstances and environmental factors, even the most experienced clinician may demonstrate attributes associated with a challenged thinker. The authors use the illustrative case of a patient with abdominal pain to demonstrate how critical thinking may manifest in learners at different stages of development, analyzing how the learner at each stage applies information obtained in the patient interaction to arrive at a differential diagnosis and plan for evaluation. The authors share important considerations and provide this work as a foundation for the development of effective approaches to teaching and promoting critical thinking and to establishing expectations for learners in this essential meta-competency.",

However, the relationship between the accuracy of self-knowledge and mental health is complex, and as a result the term “insight” has become riddled with conceptual ambiguities. This book takes a multidisciplinary approach to examine the nature and significance of insight. The first section introduces the issues and problems one is confronted with when attempting to gauge insight, and proposes solutions such as scales to make assessments. The second section investigates the origins of poor insight, while the third section examines cross-cultural differences in the awareness of and attitudes toward poor insight. The final sections explore the clinical implications of insight, including discussions on how insight affects behavior and examinations of advancements in the treatment of impaired insight. The volume presents recent advances in the study of insight from the perspectives of varied disciplines, including clinical and cognitive psychology, clinical and forensic psychiatry, neurology, neuropsychology, and philosophy, to provide a better understanding of the phenomenology, origins, cross-cultural differences, and clinical implications of insight.",

      "title": "ADHD and Reasoning Abilities: Bridging the Gap between Science and the Classroom",
      "abstract": "Human reasoning research using probability problem tasks offer a novel and exciting approach to understanding executive function impairments from a new perspective, such as with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  ADHD is widely associated with lowered academic performance thought to arise from executive function deficits relating to inhibition, impulsivity, and attention. 1 A wealth of research in executive function tasks and neurobiological fMRI studies cite impairments with executive inhibitory control as the origin of cognitive and behavioural deficits associated with ADHD. 2,3,4 By integrating research from cognitive psychology on the science of reasoning, together with knowledge of ADHD and educational psychology, this research may offer new insight into the cognitive mechanisms of executive function impairments, such as with ADHD, to better prepare educators to instruct the 5% of children diagnosed with ADHD. 5 Individuals typically implement a narrow range of procedural heuristics to simplify the process of problem-solving and decision-making, rather than systematically analyzing a problem through tedious rule-based approaches. 6 Heuristic short-cuts are often based on prior experiences or beliefs that, while crucial to human survival, may sometimes be erroneous in nature. 7,8  According to one account of dual process theories (DPT), our early judgments are considered to be drawn from fast, experiential, intuitive processes that conform to a belief bias (or the tendency to judge conclusions according to belief, regardless of validity). 9 A central feature of these faster reasoning processes is autonomy; thus, beliefs generate a rapid default response, regardless of need, which must be suppressed for deeper analysis. 10 Slower secondary processes enable analytic judgments that are effortful and taxing on working memory. 11 As analytic reasoning must be deliberately engaged to override the quicker belief-based appraisals, it is assumed that slower logical evaluations do not interfere with intuitive responses. However, the autonomously produced and faster belief-based judgments are able to interfere with slower, more rational thinking operations. 12 This master’s research examined and compared the reasoning abilities of university educated adults with and without ADHD.  Both groups solved 24 base-rate problems in free time that asked for the likelihood of group membership for an individual (e.g., what is the likelihood that Paul is a doctor?) when offered two pieces of conflicting information:  salient base-rates (3 doctors vs. 997 nurses) and a luring, but opposing, stereotypical description (Paul lives in a beautiful home in a posh suburb, is well spoken, interested in politics, and invests a lot of time in his career).  The task was coupled with an instructional manipulation that asked reasoners to respond either with beliefs (cued by the stereotypical description) or to respond statistically by way of presented base-rates.  For 12 randomly generated problems, base-rates and descriptions conflicted, cueing opposing judgements.  Another 12 randomly generated problems had matching base-rates and descriptions that cued identical judgements.  ADHD is broadly associated difficulties in inattention and impulsivity thought to originate from primordial deficits of executive inhibition. 13 Thus, it was expected that ADHD participants would perform poorly on conflict problems when deciding with statistics, as inhibitory control is required to suppress the autonomously produced intuitive response derived from beliefs.  It was very surprising to observe that ADHD reasoners were superior to controls at judging with statistics and on par with controls when deciding with beliefs.  This is both startling and counterintuitive, considering ADHD is predominantly linked to difficulties in inhibition, attention to necessary tasks, and using working memory effectively. 14, 15, 16 The literature supporting disinhibition theories of ADHD is solid, and yet ADHD participants did not demonstrate poorer reasoning abilities on a base-rate task widely assumed to require inhibitory control.  This leads to the conclusion that perhaps base-rate problems do not measure inhibitory control, as is assumed. 17 The fact that both groups were better at reasoning with statistics relative to beliefs challenges the assumption that base-rate processing even requires deeper analytic processing.  It may be that humans have a probabilistic intuition for processing base-rates spontaneously; 18 thus, suppression of an early, yet unfavourable response is not required.  A second finding is that ADHD reasoners were on par with controls in solving problems with beliefs.  This reveals that ADHD reasoners are just as capable of encoding lengthy and ambiguous information as their non-ADHD peers, despite recognized cognitive deficits.  The third and most important finding is that ADHD reasoners were significantly better than controls when solving base-rate problems with statistics.  This unexpected result raises the question of why this pattern emerged for ADHD thinkers.  One hypothesis is that ADHD thinkers implemented a cost-effective cognitive strategy when clear, salient numerical information (base-rates) was offered that could be easily extracted for problem-solving.  This strategy, however, was ineffective when resolving problems under the belief instruction that entailed the decoding of lengthy descriptive information. The hypothesis of strategy use by ADHD reasoners was confirmed by comparing response latencies for both groups.  For conflict problems, both groups required similarly longer response latencies to resolve problems with beliefs as compared to statistics.  This corroborates that solving with statistics was easier than with beliefs, which contradicts serial models of DPTs.  However, when solving non-conflict problems with beliefs – a task that should have been relatively easy as base-rates and descriptions cue the same response – the ADHD group required significantly more time than controls.  This clearly evidences that ADHD participants have developed cost-efficient problem-solving strategy when clear, salient information is offered that can be easily extracted to solve the problem.  However, they misapply this strategy to non-conflict problems when simple shortcuts could be used much more effectively.  The over-application of this strategy on non-conflict problems resulted in longer latencies for the more difficult belief instruction. The results evidence that ADHD university students are able to implement problem-solving strategies to overcome cognitive deficits when salient and easily extractable information is presented.  This finding is vital for developing effective pedagogies relating to classroom instruction for students with ADHD.  However, students must also be educated on the appropriate application of these strategies.  Further comparative investigations related to ADHD and reasoning are vital to better understand the capacity for strategic learning in individuals with ADHD, leading to better more informed instructional approaches.",

      "title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MATURITY AS A SOFT-SKILL OF A MODERN PERSONALITY",
      "abstract": "The aim of the article is to substantiate the essence and component structure of psychological maturity, and the set of soft skills as an integral part of an individual’s psychological maturity. For this research, the author employed general scientific theoretical research methods including anal- ysis, synthesis, generalisation, induction, deduction, explanation, and classification. The author has found that a modern person should be able to question established opinions and judg- ments, engage in competent and rational dialogue, determine the essence of problems and seek alterna- tive solutions, and always be able to distinguish verifiable facts from assumptions and personal subjective opinions. This, in turn, should be inherent in every mature personality, since all modern specialists are peo- ple with a wide range of knowledge and the ability to quickly adapt to new situations. As a result, they can effectively interact with colleagues and solve theoretical and practical problems. Today, the labour market requires their comprehensive development, so along with this, the ability to quickly respond to labour mar- ket demands, ensure continuous self-education, communication skills and a sense of responsibility for the results of their activities play an important role for each individual. In general, to succeed in the modern labour market, it is important to develop not only professional skills but also a wide range of so called soft skills. Only when these qualities are combined can future pro- fessionals be competitive and advance their professional careers. In order to carry out a comprehensive analysis and further practical application of the research re- sults, the author analysed 76 scientific publications related to the subject of scientific research, namely psy- chological maturity and soft skills of a modern personality. It has been determined that the characteristics of psychological maturity can be interpreted as soft skills of a personality through the prism of the defini- tion of “hard kills”, “soft skills” and “meta skills”, because they have a fundamental difference, but are in- terdependent. In general, the development of soft skills leads to an increase in self-awareness and self-un- derstanding, the formation of clear life values and goals, an increase in the ability of self-regulation and ad- aptation, and a level of life satisfaction, and are important factors in a person’s overall mental well-being. Scientific research shows that psychological maturity, which describes a set of characteristics neces- sary for successful functioning in society, is closely related to soft skills, as the study of psychological maturi- ty can help in better understanding and development of soft skills, which is extremely relevant today. There- fore, the purpose of this study is to theoretically analyse the available publications describing psychological maturity in order to identify the main (most frequently mentioned) characteristics of psychological matu- rity. To conduct this study, the author used general scientific theoretical methods of information research, namely analysis, synthesis, generalisation, induction, deduction, explanation and classification. The author determines that modern research and the experience of leaders in various fields of work indicate an increase in the role of soft skills in occupational programs and requirements for candidates for employment, which in turn leads to an improvement in positive emotional integrity in terms of increasing the team’s performance, the effectiveness of training and mutual development, a positive perception of any challenges and solving urgent problems of the enterprise, and the way to use one’s own creativity, flexibil- ity, responsibility and independence. The results of the study suggest that further research will be aimed at studying methods and tools for developing soft skills of a psychologically mature personality, as well as at studying the impact of these qualities on various aspects of human life. The study is based on the analysis of scientific publications and requires further empirical confirmation.",

      "title": "A Systematic Review of Academic Self-Concept Measures in First-year Engineering Education",
      "abstract": "Abstract This systematic review of Self-Concept and Self-Efficacy is a Complete Theory Paper. Self-concept is defined as the broad view of one's own abilities formed by self & social evaluations and interactions [1]. Self-concept is hierarchical [2], meaning its features and measures vary with one's age and their academic attainment level. Academic Self Concept (ASC) is regarded as a crucial predictor of academic outcomes and is found to be related to academic achievement. This connection suggests that methods to improve and maintain high academic self-concept among students will help them achieve desirable student outcomes (e.g., confidence to persist and identity towards the curriculum). Self-concept and self-efficacy often appear commingled in literature even though several mainstream differences exist between the two constructs, with self-concept being domain specific whereas self-efficacy being task specific among others. Instruments to accurately measure self-concept, particularly for freshman engineering students have not been identified, due to the nuances between the theories of self-concept and self-efficacy in literature. The current study involves a systematic review of research that explores prominent measures of ASC in engineering education, acknowledging that ASC measures are sometimes masked as general academic self-efficacy measures. This review will examine existing ASC instruments to identify sub-constructs that can be effectively used for the assessment of academic self-concept in first-year engineering students.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Educational psychology is an interdisciplinary field that uses psychological principles to understand and improve learning in and out of schools and across the lifespan, with a focus on typically developing learners. The field bridges basic and applied research, and most research considers a combination of cognitive (how people learn) and/or motivational (what energizes people to learn) variables. The field uses a range of research designs, from large‐scale international longitudinal questionnaire studies, to classroom experiments, laboratory studies, interviews, and mixed‐methods research. Clinical psychologists working with clients who present with learning or motivational difficulties at school might benefit from educational psychology findings in these areas. The entry concludes with some common theoretical constructs employed within both educational and clinical psychology, such as self‐efficacy and self‐determination theory.",

      "abstract": "The quality of life of the elderly 60-74 years usually experiences a lot of decline both physically, psychologically, and socially. As the quality of life of an elderly person decreases, diseases that attack an elderly person will appear. Quality of life is important in the life of the elderly, namely increasing the life expectancy of the elderly. The purpose of this study is for readers to understand several factors that can affect the quality of life of the elderly. This research uses literature review from several articles. Data was obtained using the Publish or Perish application from Google Schoolar and there were 200 articles, after reviewing 5 suitable articles. Based on the analysis of the literature review, there are several factors that affect the quality of life of the elderly ranging from nutritional status, independence, mindfulness, psychosocial, and obesity. Nutritional status which can be seen from the elderly's food consumption, independence which causes the elderly not to depend on others, mindfullnes fosters good psychological function, psychosocial which means a decrease in reciprocal relationships that cause the elderly to feel lonely, and obsessiveness caused by excessive diet.",

Este estudio teórico examina sus implicaciones desde una perspectiva integradora, considerando cinco dimensiones clave: emocional, cognitiva, motivacional, temporal y neurocientífica. A través de un análisis exhaustivo de la literatura, se plantea un modelo teórico que explica la procrastinación como un proceso dinámico, caracterizado por la interacción entre estas dimensiones y perpetuado por ciclos de evitación y refuerzo negativo. Se discute la insuficiencia de los modelos tradicionales, que abordan la procrastinación como un problema exclusivamente individual, y se enfatiza la necesidad de estrategias de intervención basadas en la autorregulación, la metacognición y la restructuración de hábitos. Los hallazgos sugieren que comprender la procrastinación como un fenómeno multidimensional permite desarrollar enfoques educativos más efectivos. En conclusión, superar la procrastinación requiere estrategias que integren elementos emocionales y cognitivos, fomentando un aprendizaje autónomo y una gestión del tiempo más eficiente.",

It would be convenient if the explanation of performance involved nothing more than the operation of purely intellective ability, and traditional cognitive processes. Unfortunately, there is growing evidence that this type of explanation is often indequate. People also bring to task performance situations distinctive sets of needs, motivations, and dispositions that influence their perceptions of the situations and how they approach them. To the extent that these types of individual differences are related to performance they should be included in research designs and the planning of educational programs.

      "title": "The Economics of Cognitive Negligence",
      "abstract": "The essence of the decision-making mechanism of rational individuals in economics is to ensure the balance between benefits and costs. The benefit received from a decision is expected to be higher than its cost. It is so in cognitive activities. Any cognitive practice may require effort, expenses, and time-use to some extent. However, the actors do not always do all they can. A significant reason for not using cognitive abilities adequately in verbal, written, and visual information production is the individuals’ not wholly bearing the negative consequences of their cognitive actions. Such a cognitive attitude differs from similar notions of rational ignorance, rational inattention, and mental laziness. This paper introduces a new concept, cognitive negligence, that refers to the tendency of individuals to avoid the cost and maximize benefits in cognitive activities by making an implicit or explicit cost-benefit analysis. The paper presents why and how cognitive negligence emerges. It defines the factors affecting it, such as the position of the actor, perception of importance, context or type of activity, time of action, social distance, and the diversity of the audience. Its relationship with lying, distortion, and critical thinking is discussed. Finally, the consequences of cognitive negligence are evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The construction of knowledge is dependent upon a system of relations linking the child's skills to a variety of interactive contexts, which are governed, in turn, by broader social influence. However, the child plays an active role in the cognitive and social management of exchanges. The issue lies in the articulation of intra‐ and inter‐individual processes in knowledge elaboration. Analysis of the dynamics of change and socio‐cognitive mechanisms underlying child's performance can shed light on this topic. In elaboration processes at the individual level, cognitive and metacognitive knowledge enter into the child's awareness of his/her difficulties, the need for help from others, and the integration of new information to knowledge‐in‐construction. Helping relations are part of interpersonal dynamics, whose forms are dependent on various situational factors. In direct exchanges, a variety of mechanisms such as imitation, conflict in viewpoint and reorganization, and guidance/tutoring may account for cognitive progress. The management of the situation is shared by the child and his/her partner(s), but to varying degrees as a function of the type of interactive dynamics at work. In contrast, in indirect exchanges, child productions are dependent on a metasystem of control whose mechanisms are extremely difficult to capture. However, different general mechanisms—such as recourse to an internalized model, conflict between models, reorganization through emotional or social resources—may also play a role at this molar level. These mechanisms present commonalities with those identified at interpersonal level, and it is warranted to raise the issue of the similarity between socio‐cognitive organizations at different levels of interaction.",

      "abstract": "Self-efficacy denotes people's beliefs about their ability to perform in different situations. It functions as a multilevel and multifaceted set of beliefs that influence how people feel, think, motivate themselves, and behave during various tasks. Self-efficacy beliefs are informed by enactive attainment, vicarious experience, imaginal experiences, and social persuasion as well as physical and emotional states. These beliefs are mediated by cognitive, motivational, affective, and selection processes to generate actual performance. Self-efficacy development is closely intertwined with a person's experiences, competencies, and developmental tasks in different domains at different stages in life. This paper reviews the literature to outline the definition and theoretical conceptualizations of the construct originally devised by Bandura that have flourished since the 1990s. Drawing from the studies of the construct to assess self-efficacy, and to inform positive youth development, the paper will present the determinants of the development of self-efficacy beliefs and identify the connection between self-efficacy and adolescent developmental outcomes. The paper will conclude with strategies to enhance youth self-efficacy and proposals for future research directions.",

However, there are inconsistencies in the scope of what is included within the concept of awareness and the way in which it is measured within the literature. A comprehensive model of awareness is needed to guide the development of measurement tools and interventions. This paper expands upon concepts originally proposed by Crosson and colleagues [12] and proposes a comprehensive model of awareness that integrates parallel themes in cognitive psychology, social psychology and neuropsychology. It argues that a hierarchical view of awareness does not capture the complexities and subtleties of awareness symptoms and proposes a dynamic relationship between knowledge, beliefs, task demands and context of a situation. A distinction between knowledge and awareness, that one has prior to a task, and that, which is activated during task performance, is emphasized. Suggestions for expanding assessment and intervention methodology are derived from the perspective of research within the areas of metacognition and self-efficacy.",

There is a sudden experience of helplessness, loss of control, fear for one’s own life, and the humiliation of having been violated. The victim may run out of internal and external reference elements. Objectives Describe the factors that influence the development of Post-traumatic stress disorder after experiencing traumatic experiences. Methods Review in the literature of the different factors that influence the subject’s response to the traumatic experience. Results 1) Predisposing and precipitating factors: – characteristics of the traumatic evento: severity of the stressor agent: dose-dependent, Characteristics of the same: sudden, prolonged, repetitive, intentional; decrease the ability to control the situation and develop effective coping strategies; they question basic cognitive schemas; the symbolic meaning of the traumatic evento. – characteristics of the person (predisposing factors of vulnerability): genetic-constitutional vulnerability, adverse experiences in childhood, previous traumatic events: increased vulnerability, personality characteristics, recent stressors or life changes, inadequate support system, use of alcohol, perception locus control more external than internal, pre-existing psychiatric symptoms: neuroticism, anxiety, depression, critical ages of development: time of greatest vulnerability (11-16 years). 2) Perpetuating and empowering factors: sharing traumatic events, seeking the logic of the facts, rupture of affective ties. 3) Elements of Resistance: tendency to selectively remember the positive elements in autobiographical memory, acceptance of a certain dose of uncertainty in life, perceiving themselves as survivors, perception of the stressful stimulus as less threatening, Less physiological reactivity to stress, use of humor, positive emotions counteracting during the traumatic process. 4) Elements of Resilience: ability to extract and assimilate positive elements from negative situations. Conclusions Trauma threatens 3 basic assumptions of life: the world is good, the world has meaning, the self has value.

      "title": "The State of Engineering Graduate Student Researcher Self-Awareness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Self-awareness is an umbrella term that encompasses concepts including self-reflection, introspection, insight, self-regulation, and self-efficacy, among others. These terms are independent of each other but work together to contribute to the overall self-awareness of an individual. For a graduate student researcher, their self-awareness level can influence how they engage with their discipline and research relationships. Interactions within mentoring relationships can be negatively impacted if there is a lack of self-awareness for one or more parties. To increase an individual's self-awareness, practices in self-reflection may provide opportunities to gain insight, leading to a deeper level of understanding. However, there is limited research in the field of engineering education that considers self-awareness specifically as an aspect of research mentoring relationships. The goal of this study was to assess the current climate of STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) graduate student researchers' self-awareness using the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale, with emphasis on engineering graduate students. The aspects of self-awareness that were measured include engagement in self-reflection and insight. This preliminary study will inform future work related to self-awareness and its influence on engineering research mentoring relationships. Method: To assess the current state of engineering graduate student researchers' self-awareness, a mixed-method pilot study was conducted using the two qualitative short-response questions and the validated Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS). The Self-Reflection and Insight Scale measures an individual's ability to self-reflect and gain insight. Findings from the quantitative analysis STEMM graduate students' data are presented in this paper. Conclusions: 160 graduate students completed the survey representing 26 departments across four colleges at the University of Florida. Findings suggests that 1) females engage in self-reflection more than males; 2) graduate student mentors in hybrid/wet labs are more insightful than those in dry labs; and 3) Non-engineering graduate student mentors are more insightful than engineering graduate student mentors. Ongoing research, including qualitative interviews to identify the self-reflective practices and influences of engineering graduate student researcher mentors, will uncover existing reflection strategies. Future research will also focus on developing a scale that measures self-awareness-related dimensions within STEMM mentoring relationships.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews four theoretical social psychological perspectives that can contribute to future research on service learning and civic outcomes: identity, emotions, motivations, and attitudes. The development of one's sense of self begins in infancy and continues throughout one's life. Especially during adolescence and early adulthood, civic identity develops and, most importantly, can change as a product of interactions with others. Emotions (e.g., sadness, fear, happiness, surprise) and moods (e.g., euphoria, empathy, compassion) can influence civic actions and contribute to civic identities. In particular, research evidence supports empathy's role in developing civic motives and behaviors, although motives and behaviors related to empathy may be mediated by the principle of caring. According to self-determination theory, people have three psychological needs that contribute to intrinsic motivation: relatedness, competence, and autonomy. However, different strategies can be used by educators for students with different levels of motivation.",

      "abstract": "Comunicarse de manera eficaz, es decir, con seguridad, templanza, competencia y reciprocidad, es fundamental en cualquier aspecto de la vida, y muy especialmente en el trabajo, dónde es imprescindible cooperar y colaborar con los demás para satisfacer las propias necesidades y responder a las demandas planteadas. Comunicarse con eficacia o de manera asertiva es una clase de conducta susceptible de entrenamiento mediante procedimientos fundamentados en la Teoría del Aprendizaje Social. Como cualquier clase de conducta, consta de distintos componentes: cognitivos, emocionales y de comportamiento manifiesto (tanto verbal como no verbal), que deben ajustarse a una situación concreta para lograr su funcionalidad. Ello aumenta, a su vez, la probabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos planteados y de responder con certeza a las demandas propuestas, obteniéndose así una serie de ventajas, tanto personales como grupales y organizativas. Entre ellas, se puede destacar el alcanzar una mayor competencia social, autoestima, satisfacción personal, cohesión grupal, destreza para trabajar en equipo y una disminución de las tensiones y conflictos interpersonales y grupales. La obra que te dispones a ver, partiendo de un supuesto práctico como es la participación en una entrevista de selección de personal, pretende responder de una manera aplicada a las siguientes cuestiones: Qué son las habilidades sociales, para qué sirven, cómo se adquieren, qué clase o estilo de comunicación es más eficaz, qué técnicas son más ventajosas para su enseñanza y cómo puede beneficiar su aprendizaje. Esta obra es fruto de una larga experiencia en el desarrollo de programas de entrenamiento en habilidades sociales con y para distintos colectivos que deben afrontar situaciones difíciles y conflictivas, que requieren para su resolución el apoyo y la comunicación interpersonal y social. En su realización, no solo hemos puesto nuestro conocimiento del tema, difundido a través de monografías y artículos científico-técnicos, sino también la emoción que nos genera trabajar en un tema en el que creemos y sabemos puede ser útil para otras personas. Deseamos que disfrute utilizando esta humilde aportación al entrenamiento en habilidades sociales, tanto como nosotros realizándola.",

This requires coordination with teachers, administrators, school nursing/medical providers, parents, and often classmates. The steps include mental rest, light cognitive activity (e.g., reading familiar material), moderate cognitive activity (e.g., new material in the student’s strongest subject), back to school with accommodations and extra rest, back to school without accommodations, catch up on missed work, then resume extracurricular activities. For complex concussions, reduce barriers to optimal cognitive performance, such as sleep disorders, headache, depression, and anxiety. There is no point in trying to return to school when any of these are substantially impairing. Reduced cognitive activity is associated with faster resolution of concussion-related symptoms, but complete cognitive rest is not necessary. Patients do not have to be completely symptom-free to return to school and to light exercise. Consider using a quantitative measure such as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).",

Yet, numerous conceptualizations of well-being exist, which hampers conceptual and empirical research on student well-being, and the development of measurement instruments of and interventions on well-being. To advance research and practice, we propose a definition and conceptual framework of student well-being that may serve as a basis for measuring, understanding, and promoting students’ well-being. We formulated four guiding postulates based on philosophical underpinnings of established perspectives on well-being that guided the development of our definition and framework, which was further shaped by existing literature and the input from meetings with experts. We define student well-being as a multi-facetted concept that reflects a students' degree of positive or negative cognitive appraisal about and affective experience with the self. Student well-being comprises seven interrelated facets (i.e., meaning in life, self-esteem, autonomy, relatedness, sense of belonging, subjective health, body acceptance) grouped into three domains: psychological, social, and physical. The conceptual framework outlines predictors and outcomes of student well-being. We discuss implications of our definition and framework for science and practice, as well as outline several key avenues for future research on student well-being.",

The context is much broader, starting from work conditions at their work place, through physical and climate factors, social environment and support, down to psychophysical status of an individual, his/her general work efficiency and risk from getting professional illnesses. Although the mechanisms and causes of fatigue occurring at work have long been a subject of study and interest in the area of psychophysiology of work, the fact is that to the day there has been no unique and generally accepted definition of fatigue, not only due to complex causes of its origin, but also due to complexity and diversity of its manifestations. Factors that are subject of study may be grouped into areas of contents of work, organization of work or work environment, and they significantly affect working ability and its misbalance, needs, capabilities and requirements to be met by an individual at a work place. Similarly to the concept of stress at work, fatigue as a reversible physiological occurrence manifests itself in physiological, i.e. health-related, psychological and professional areas, which in the long run affects total performance and efficiency of an individual, and results in unfit behavior, mental problems or physical illness. Keeping this in mind, it is important that a professional department and personnel management in organizations and institutions should react in a timely manner in order to prevent, detect and eliminate the factors that bring an individual at work to chronicle fatigue, therefore, to reduced performance and productivity at work.",

      "title": "Functions of Aggressive Behaviors – Implications for Interventions",
      "abstract": "Understanding human behavior - a symptom of perception, cognition, and emotionHuman behaviors represent the whole range of emotional and behavioral reactions and expressions manifested by an individual in different moments along lifespan. Human behaviors represent an important subject for concern for many schools of thinking. There are multiple explanations about the bases and determinants of human behavior, from neurophysiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy. The intense study, observations, and experimentations on human behaviors offer the necessary body of knowledge to develop theories about the determinants and stages of human behaviors' development, the identifications of theirs main characteristics, and the classification of the different types of behaviors. The reason for developing these theories are multiple. First, we understand why and how some behaviors emerge and develop, what are the compulsory conditions and factors who reinforced or extinct one type of behavior. Secondly, observing and decoding one's behaviors offer the opportunity to explore human's psyche (thoughts, feelings. attitudes, and values). Behaviors are defined and classified, based on different criteria and perspectives, in normal and abnormal, rational and irrational, accepted and unaccepted, and appropriate and inappropriate behaviors. These classifications, although ambiguous and historically, culturally, and socially dependent, are relevant in the applied field of education, rehabilitation, and psychotherapy. We use these characterizations of behaviors as criteria in the diagnostic process and in interventions. An important manifest aspect of behavior is their impulsive, automatic, emotional, immature vs. controlled, rational, mature characteristics. Perry (2006) affirms that this aspect of the behavioral response to a situation depends on the developmental level of the nervous system that processes the input and generates the reaction. The nervous system is organized in hierarchic structures, developed progressively in a sequential fashion, in ontogenesis. The lower structures of the nervous system (subcortical, limbic, midbrain, brainstem, and autonomic) generate reactions that evolve ontogenetically, as the child grow and mature, from reflexive (newborn) to abstract reasoning (emerged during adolescence to young adulthood). This neurosequential approach to therapy underline the importance of assessing the developmental ages of the children (physical, emotional, social, cognitive, and behavioral levels of development), and to adapt educational and therapeutic expectations and activities accordingly (Perry, 2006). Depending on the maturation of these neurological structures, the abilities for emotional self-regulation and behavioral self-control are, also, developing gradually. The characteristics of child life space and his/her history of life also impact on these abilities, directly through modeling and social learning, and indirectly, by altering neurological structures and functions. Along with the degree of nervous system maturation and functionality, another important determinant of impulsive, automatic behavioral response is the situation characteristics that might signal and/or be assessed as potentially dangerous. In the moment of perceived imminent and serious danger and threat, the human body resorts to an automatic, unconscious, and predictable response, generating the body well-known types of responses to stress: fight, flight, or freeze (Long et al., 2014; Selye, 1956). These reactions respond to specific needs: freeze and flight grant the escape or the avoidance, while flight might pursuit the attention, the affirmation of power, or the revenge. The behavioral response to a stressful and frustrating situation might be projected outward, as in externalized disorders (oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorders, hyperactivity, antisocial behaviors), or inward, as in internalized disorders (anxiety, depression, somatization, avoidant disorder). …",

      "abstract": "<div class=\"abstract\" data-abstract-type=\"normal\"> Success in mathematics—however you wish to define it—comes from a strong sense of self-confidence: the confidence to acknowledge one's emotions and to calm them down, the confidence to pause over ideas and come to educated guesses or conclusions, the confidence to rely on one's wits to navigate through unfamiliar terrain, the confidence to choose understanding over impulsive rote doing, and the confidence to persevere. Success and joy in science, business, and in life doesn't come from programmed responses to pre-set situations. It comes from agile and adaptive thinking coupled with reflection, assessment, and further adaptation. Students—and adults too—are often under the impression that one should simply be able to leap into a mathematics challenge and make instant progress of some kind. This not how mathematics works! It is okay to fumble, and flail, and to try out ideas that turn out not help in the end. In fact, this <span class='italic'>is</span> the problem-solving process and making multiple false starts should not at all be dismissed! (Think of how we solve problems in everyday life.) It is also a natural part of the problem-solving process to react to a problem. “This looks scary.” “This looks fun.” “I don't have a clue what the question is even asking!” “Wow. Weird! Could that really be true?” “Who cares?” “I don't get it.” “Is this too easy? I am suspicious.” We are each human, and the first step to solving a problem is to come to terms with our emotional reaction to it—especially if that reaction is one of being overwhelmed. Step 1 to problem-solving mentioned in the previous section in vital. Once we have nerves in check, at least to some degree, there are a number of techniques one could try in order to make some progress with the problem. The ten strategies we briefly outline in the appendix are discussed in full detail on the MAA's CURRICULUM INSPIRATIONS webpage, www.maa.org/ci. There you will find essays and videos explaining each technique in full, with worked examples and slews of further practice examples and their solutions. </div>",

Creativity is inseparably linked with innovations that are successful implementation of creative ideas. Although the creativity phenomenon has been under study for more than 60 years there are still many misconceptions of creativity, since the results of creative process are almost unpredictable. Creativity, being a multifaceted phenomenon, can be measured by such diagnostics that helps to evaluate both creative potential and creative achievements according to cognitive, emotional, motivational and environmental factors. Diagnostic instruments vary from the purpose of study, creativity aspects, features and forms, temporal limits and age range. Many of the creativity evaluation approaches are not exhaustive, but when combined can supplement and enrich each other. Clearly defined criteria set and presented to students before work make evaluation more effective. Students’ creative work measurement compared with other products helps to assess its novelty, originality and value. Moreover diagnostic measurement of students’ creativity facilitates the forecasting of students’ creative potential development and change of creative achievements’ level in educational process.",

Anticipated operational requirements can be decomposed into specific tasks, conditions, and standards, but how should individuals, teams, and units prepare for the unexpected, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? This matter is viewed as an aspect of cognitive readiness. Situation awareness, memory, transfer, meta-cognition, automaticity, problem solving, decision-making, mental flexibility and creativity, leadership, and emotion are considered as bases for ways in which we can prepare operational personnel to deal with the unexpected. Science and Technology (S&T) developments in cognitive theory, cognitive readiness assessment, training for cognitive readiness, and assessing the military value of training are needed to devise reliable techniques for ensuring cognitive readiness in this area.",

      "abstract": "The focus needs to be on the functional impact of a communication problem rather than the diagnostic label, just as the Mental Capacity Act emphasises the need for a functional test of capacity and prohibits assumptions about capacity based on diagnosis. People with communication impairments are described as people with speech, language or communication needs (SLCN). Alternative or Augmentative Communication is anything that replaces or supports spoken and written communication and can be divided into \"high-tech\" and \"low-tech\" aids. Abbreviations are part of everyday communication; however, different abbreviations may mean different things to people depending on their background. The communication should be face-to-face with ideally only two people having the discussion so people can use their one-to-one skills without needing group communication skills. People with SLCN will have difficulty understanding some grammatical structures. An assessor should have an awareness of the structures most often misunderstood.",

      "title": "The contribution of intuitive thinking to the growth in teaching abilities",
      "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that the use of teaching abilities in pre-active teaching contributes to the growth in the cognitive structure of teaching abilities, which in turns increases the availability of teaching abilities in future pre-active as well as in interactive teaching. However, in interactive teaching the teacher is often confronted with startling unexpected teaching learning situations, which did not occur previously in the same way. The teacher must respond immediately, without conscious deliberation, and yet the use of teaching routines is inappropriate. The analytic mode of thought, which is common in pre-active teaching, is no longer adequate here. Intuitive thinking is appropriate because unprejudiced and empathetic perception of the situation makes it possible to form an image in which the cognitive structure of teaching abilities is present in the mode of simultaneous, non-verbal, and subconscious significances. The behavioral response of the teacher reflects the richness of significances in the image. However, intuitive thinking only contributes to the growth in the cognitive structure of teaching abilities if verification of the behavioral reaction in terms of logical, verbalized justification takes place.",

      "title": "Thinking about prognosis",
      "abstract": "The prognostic assessment of a patient aims to pre­dict the future, using the range of evidence available. This evidence relates to: … ● the individual patient (e.g. their own history of illness, and their compliance with medication); ● groups of patients like the individual patient, that is, diagnostic and subdiagnostic groups (e.g. in depressive disorder, the risk of recurrence; and in anorexia nervosa, the risk of suicide or of death by starvation); ● psychiatric patients in general (e.g. the importance of good relationships with healthcare professionals, supportive family and friends, and insight into illness). … Prognostic assessment results in an understanding of the following: … ● What outcomes are likely to happen? Relevant outcomes can be related to the illness (relapse and recurrence, for example— see ‘Terminology’ for definitions), to treatments (such as side effects or complications), to risks (to self, to others— see Chapter 7), or to important social outcomes (such as return to work, marital break- up, or permission to drive a car, bus, or lorry). ● How likely are they to happen, and when/ over what time period? An estimate of both likelihood and timeline is helpful. So, for example, in a patient with recurrent depressive episodes, who is now well, we may view that their lifetime risk of suicide is significantly higher than the population risk, that they are not currently at increased risk, and that suicide attempts are likely to occur in the context of depressive recurrence. ● What can change the nature or likelihood of the outcomes? For example, in the case just mentioned, we may view that the lifetime risk of recurrence can be reduced by training the patient and family to spot the early warning signs of illness, by reducing daily consumption of alcohol, and by finding regular, stable employment. In addition, we can reduce suicidal risk by ensuring that the patient is prescribed medicines that are relatively safe in overdose (e.g. SSRI antidepressants rather than tricyclics), and by making family members aware of the risk of their own medication being used in an overdose.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Emotional maltreatment can be considered either neglectful or abusive, and like other forms of maltreatment it can occur within a pattern or range of severity and duration and be associated with other forms of abuse and neglect. Thus, this form of maltreatment has often been hard to define, to recognize, and to address with CPS involvement. This section will suggest a framework of assessment and treatment for the CPS worker based on child development and literature from experts in this area. The definition of emotional maltreatment under the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) is a repeated pattern of caregiver behavior or an extreme incident of behavior that conveys to children that they are worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another’s need. Psychological maltreatment includes acts of commission as well as acts of omission (CAPTA, 1974). In state statutes, emotional maltreatment is defined in many different ways; therefore, it is advisable to review the exact wording of the state’s definition.",

The performance of self-care behaviours can be influenced both positively and negatively by the attitudes of others. Throughout life, the purpose for performing self-care differs and individuals face challenges that interfere with their ability to master these self-care behaviours. Individuals who are able to find symbolic meaning in the disease/disability or reframe the implications positively are more capable of adapting and maintaining their focus on caring for themselves. Studies revealed that individuals may abandon self-care when overwhelmed by symptoms or disability and/or when they feel that they are not supported. Implications for practice It is valuable for health care professionals to understand the struggle that individuals experience when trying to engage in self-care. Furthermore, health care professionals need to be cognizant of how important their support is, in terms of encouraging individuals to adopt and maintain self-care behaviours. Implications for research This review has provided an insight into the process of engaging in self-care through the different developmental stages of life, as well as the adoption of self-care behaviours to meet different requisites. Further research would be valuable to integrate the range of health care interventions provided to individuals across different disability or disease groupings who engage in self-care activities.",

      "abstract": "We have progressed to a phase where there is very little difference between men and women, but the reality in many countries is that women are looked down as the inferior gender and not given career opportunities to explore. They are not let into the decision-making roles at the organization even when they have an equal qualification, experience and skill. They are placed low in the hierarchy which allows them to witness the functions at the higher level of the organization but restricts them from participating in them. There are a lot of factors like cultural, socio-demographic factors and society itself that influence this disparity in the organization. These contributory factors create the glass ceiling phenomenon at the workplace, thereby generating emotional and psychological imbalances in women employees. This is a conceptual paper aiming to explore the concept and impact of mindfulness, and various concepts of mindfulness could be used as an emotional aid to treat the psychological effects of the glass ceiling. It further explains some of the mindful concepts like mindful walking, mindful life and mindfulness-based stress reduction technique in treating some of the psychological and emotional issues like depression, anxiety, frustration, traumatic experiences, adjustment issues, addiction, stress, low self-esteem, low self-confidence and aggression. It also elucidates adopting mindfulness techniques in real organizational scenarios where women are constantly discriminated because of their gender and opportunities are taken away.",

      "abstract": "Games and exercises, which have an important place in the life of the individual in every developmental period of humans as a social being contribute to the communication and interaction of the individual with the environment, to the development of social cognitive skills such as problem-solving, analytical thinking, creative thinking, and reasoning as well as positively affecting the physical and mental development. Individuals, who try to survive in a mentally and physically challenging and demanding work pace or by being inactive for a long time in front of a computer screen, spend their energy through games, exercises, and physical activities, and can be discharged by relaxing. In this respect, it is possible to evaluate the entire games, exercises, and physical activities as a driving force to gather energy again after a tiring work tempo or as a source of motivation to move away from mental and physical fatigue. It is considered that performing activities such as exercises and playing games by individuals, considering them as a way of life and evaluating the factors, which keep individuals away from these activities, can be possible by explaining individual perceptions on these issues. In the light of these data, the meanings and values associated with the concepts of games and exercises by academics and engineers who live in different cultural structures, who cannot allocate adequate time for games and exercises in a compulsory work tempo, or who can acquire internal and external motivation via games and exercises as well as exercise frequency and playing times. The present study was conducted to examine the perceptions of academics and engineers on the concepts of game and exercise via metaphor analysis in June 2019 with the participation of scientists, academicians, and engineers who participated in the 2019 International Microwave Symposium (IMS) at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston, MA, USA, which was held with the participation of many scientists, academicians, and engineers from all over the world as a total of 135 participants, 56 women and 79 men, who agreed to participate in the study voluntarily, made up the study group. The metaphor analysis form that was prepared by the researcher was used in obtaining the data to reveal the perceptions of the participants about the concepts of game and exercise. The participants were asked to complete the statements with the statements of “Game is like … because …” and “Exercise is like … because …” in addition to their age, gender, nationality, residence, occupation, perceived income status, and educational status. After the data were analyzed, various metaphors for the concepts of game and exercise were detected. Also, different game playing times and exercise frequencies emerged as a result of the self-evaluation of each participant.",

      "title": "Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency",
      "abstract": "The article announces a theoretically complete and methodically substantiated author’s concept of personal self-efficacy, which justifies this integral psychosocial f u n c t i o n a l as one of the basic cognitive mechanisms of human developmental presence in the world. Essentially, it is said about the three-factorially formed (personality, environment, behavior) conscious ability and self-valued ability of a person to carry out behavior in accordance with a complex task or newly appeared problem situation and eventually successfully cope with life problems. The first two subsections, outlining the functional possibilities and various effects of self-perception of one’s efficacy (intensification of learning, mobilization of effort, selection of activity, increase in productivity, etc.), reveal the strategy and principle of the micro-analytical methodology, specifically offering graded self-efficacy scales as a set of tasks of varying difficulty, problematics, stress resistance, and other traits-parameters of the subject being examined, leading to a detailed assessment of the degree, strength, and total coefficient of self-efficacy compared to benchmark productivity in behavioral actions. In general, the micro-analytical procedure in the author’s experience of methodologization encompasses at least four s t e p s of psychological observation of a person’s or group’s behavior: focusing attention, accumulating all possible information, reproducing a behavior model, and sufficient motivation to intellectually process all this. In this important dimension of the researcher’s consciousness expansion, the author’s reflection rightly states: “A special merit of the micro-analytical approach is that specific indicators of self-efficacy provide refined predictions of human action and the affective reactivity of a person to leisure challenges.” Notably, in the subsequent subsections, causal, inductive-comparative, general-prognostic, self-motivational, causal-career, goal-oriented, and competent types of analysis of the perceived self-regulatory effectiveness of a person in his invariants, modalities, gender trajectories and peculiarities of personal and collective functioning are carried out. Here, an idea of the author of self-efficacy probes is original, which has received both conceptual understanding and empirical implementation in the treatment of phobias and other mental ailments. It is worth noting that such a separate probe is positioned as an effective psychodiagnostic tool, constructed in personalized locations of coping-strategy modeling, enabling the conduction of therapeutic procedures regarding the subjects’ perception of their own self-efficacy at a predefined low, medium, or high (maximum) level. It is argued that within the framework of the highly complex theoretical subjectification – dynamic interaction between self-referential thought, action, and social influence – there are: 1) four main sources of information (achievement of productivity, experience of observation of others’ behavior, verbal persuasion, and partners’ relationships, certain physiological states revealing the ability, strength, and vulnerability of the person); 2) four factors for successful treatment of phobic dysfunctions (identification of essential features, managing anxious excitement through thought, self-relaxation, purposeful mastery of fear overcoming skills); 3) four parameters for measuring self-feeling of physical efficacy (physical load, heart capacity, emotional stress, sexual activity); 4) four most important external stimuli of human functioning (interest in activity, reward, management of one’s own productivity, cultivation of personal effectiveness); 5) four classes of incentive-motivators to increase self-efficacy (goal-oriented, self-motivational, competency-conditioned, career advancement); 6) four channels for asserting the feeling of control over one’s actions, situations, and threats (emotional reactions, thought modeling, behavioral and cognitive control); 7) four key internal factors of perceived by a person one’s own inefficacy (anxiety due to the inability to influence events and social conditions, a sense of uselessness due to unproductiveness or ineffectiveness of actions, apathy and a tendency to dipression generated by stereotypical centering on negative results of activity, despondency as a result of irreparable loss or inability to achieve existentially desired, urgent); 8) several important prerequisites for weakening self-efficacy through a person’s refusal of personal control (difficult-to-perform personal investments of time, effort, resources and self-limits in his knowledge and organizational competence, misuse of proxy-control when pressure is exerted on authorities or rulers, etc.); 9) a number of factors slowing down the development of collective effectiveness (widespread dependence on the dominance of technique and technology, the pressure of bureaucratic structures, ethno-local disagreements, the militant factionalism of political organizations and professional groups, the pressure of social institutions, the dominance of the transnational companies interests, etc.); 10) four decisive internal barriers created by the perception of collective self-efficacy and perniciously demoralize the manifestation of joint efforts (personal passivity, feeling of societal helplessness, fragmented goal perception by participants, disappointment from the ineffectiveness of collective efforts and institutional means). At the same time, quite convincing are the author’s psychologically grounded empirical facts regarding the fundamental importance of self-efficacy as a complex-system cognitive mechanism-mediator (in the aggregate of sources, factors, internal conditions, traits-qualities) between the person and the environment, which causes the actual forms and models of their behavior. For example, observation, modeling, and reinforcement play a primary role in why and how people learn; the choice made by the person of activity “during the formation of their self-efficacy constructs one’s life path through selective development of competencies, interests, and partner preferences; a personality’s awareness of their self-efficacy leads to greater effort in performing complex tasks, and the higher the level of personal self-efficacy, the higher their productivity; people can acquire new behavior patterns through observation of the behavior models of those around them, which they can later replicate; high personal self-efficacy, enhancing the desire for successful outcomes, contributes self-respect, while low self-efficacy – being a source of failure expectations – reduces self-respect.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Issue/problem The need for behavioural insights in disease prevention and health promotion could hardly be over-emphasised. Health behaviours constitute the foundation of good physical and mental health. It is well-know that people acquire a chronic disease because of a poor quality diet, physical inactivity, overindulgence in alcohol and tobacco use, but also because of non-adherence to the treatment regimen and adverse psychosocial influences such as negative affect, depression, or loneliness. Description of the problem Yet, how can we explain the chasm between knowledge about health determinants and action? Why we are not able to close the gap between what we know and what we put into practice to improve people's health? Maybe part of the answer is that we should break the silos and apply knowledge and expertise from also other fields and disciplines; and based on the synergistic use of knowledge from multiple sources to obtain new useful knowledge elements. Results One of the most promising knowledge fusions lie in behavioural insights that combine lessons from behavioural economics, psychology, neuroscience, and social science with empirically-tested results to provide a better understanding of how people behave and make decisions. The opportunities that behavioural insights may offer to fight chronic diseases have recently been acknowledged by several leading public health institutions and organisations. For instance, ‘Healthier choices: Incorporating behavioural insights' is one of the four flagship initiatives of the WHO's European Programme of Work 2020-2025. Lessons The potential benefits of behavioural insights are multiple as they are often very low cost, scalable, and light touch. This is especially relevant within the context of overstretched healthcare systems. What is needed is capacity building in order to broaden our understanding of measures that have originated from behavioural sciences and have a lot to offer to public health.",

      "abstract": "Careers signify an individual’s personality, habits, and lifestyle. Not finding the right career can lead to poor self-esteem, lowered self-efficacy, a lack of life satisfaction, and even depression. Various negative emotions might be experienced before or during various stages of the career decision-making process and during their performance at work. In the context of “life-career” integrations, there is a need to design specific methods of Acceptance and Commitment therapy for career counselling. Even after many trials and attempts to use ACT for career counselling there still is a dearth of robust empirical data from ACT incorporated career counselling trials. 15 students of age between 14 and 28 were invited as volunteers to participate in 6-sessions (45-minute-long) career counselling programme for each.  A wide variety of issues were discussed including career indecision, procrastination, lack of interest in present career, expectations of family members in career success, high expectations from one self, negative self-evaluation in career, lack of focus in career development, avoidance of experiences related to “evaluation of one’s strengths and challenges”. In keeping with the spirit of the ACT, a non-reductionist and a de-intellectualized framework has been designed as a tool for designing case formulations while using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in career counselling. The framework outlines some of the prominent questions, discussions, implications of ACT strategies and some examples of metaphors and worksheets.",

Cognitive learning theories emerged as a countermovement to behaviorism and turned to internal cognitive processes instead of behavior as the domain to explain learning. Constructivist learning theories differ from social-cognitive learning theories in that they assume that the human sensory functions, perceptions, and memory actively construct realities for the purpose of successful action rather than representing objective reality. Transformative learning theories are a subset of learning theories that draw from constructivist understandings of learning while critically expanding on them. Social theories of learning recognize that learning occurs in communities of practice, through interactions with others. Different learning theories are differently suited when it comes to specific learning requirements and objectives for specific learners.

      "title": "Procrastination as A Factor of Subjective Perception of Time",
      "abstract": "In order to form a successful healthy personality, modern society requires from it more and more advanced, developed psychological qualities: to be focused, persistent, confident, organized, competitive and so on. In contrast, there is always a phenomenon such as procrastination, which can be directly negatively related to the emotional-volitional and motivational spheres, and thus be a barrier to the formation of a successful personality. This article discusses the causes and prerequisites of the phenomenon of procrastination, such as a propensity for impulsivity, orientation to search for emotions and feelings, difficulty in bridging the gap between intention and action, poor concentration. Different types of procrastination are also considered: household, decision-making, compulsive, neurotic, and academic. Features of subjective perception of time are revealed, such as age, conditioned reflexes, occupation of a person and evaluation of the past. The concept of the culture of a deadline is considered, as a phenomenon when all actions, desires and responsibilities of a person have their own end time after which, everything becomes no longer relevant. Here we will show that people tend to procrastinate when their subjective perception of time is higher. This is well manifested in the phenomenon of \"delayed life syndrome\". People live as if they have another life ahead of them, which is just preparation. This state is inherent in more or less everyone when some plans or dreams are postponed for later. The theoretical analysis of the concept of \"delayed life syndrome\" is carried out, describing the phenomenon when a person cannot live today, to enjoy what he has because he continually postpones subjectively crucial decisions for the future. Life itself is considered only as a preparation for the life of the future, the \"present\". The leading causes of \"delayed life syndrome\" are found, such as the mismatch of life expectancies that a person has formed in childhood, with real events, and the excessive desire to obtain results while ignoring the process of obtaining these same results.",

      "abstract": "Emotion is a signal that there has been a change in the subjectively perceived state of the internal or external world, which is accompanied by a physiological response (external: impulse to action, or internal: mood altera-tion), each of which is expressed through a different configuration and designates different emotional responses (joy, sadness, fear, etc.; but also anger, rage, aggression, etc.). Moreover, emotions possess a strongly contextual-ised and specific social dimension that depends on the situation and interpersonal relations: the specific meaning is determined by the subjective and intersubjective evaluation that is attributed to the emotional event. These general considerations suggest both the importance of emotional experience in the course of development, its significance in the organisation of affective relations and its functional value as an adaptation (defence, offence, approach or control) capable of maintaining or modifying the individual's relations with his (physical and social) environment. What happens when emotions are particularly intense and dysfunctional? Several studies have found that more than 60 per cent of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit problematic emotional behaviour such as irritability, outbursts of anger, self- and hetero-aggressiveness, etc. In addition, these people experience high levels of anxiety and increased negative emotions, which can contribute to intensified feelings of distress and have a negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life. Controlling these negative emotions through self-regulation can prevent these behavioural problems.",

This will enable you to answer the question ‘what makes this area of practice ‘professional’?’ Professionalism entails being able to increasingly integrate and develop all the areas of competence that you demonstrated as a successful social work student. \r\n\r\nSocial workers in the UK have become familiar with frameworks of professional standards which state what social workers should be able to do in relation to a particular role or set of tasks: for example, assessing people’s needs, care planning, working with families or presenting a court report. Some standards (for example, England’s Knowledge and Skills Statements for working with children or adults) are sub-divided to reflect what is expected at different levels of career development. Standards thus provide a way of measuring how well a practitioner’s competence matches up to an externally set expectation. This chapter's approach to skills is more akin to the concept of ‘capabilities’. Capabilities refer to a holistic integration of personal qualities, values, knowledge and understanding, as well as practice skills. The concept is also developmental, in the sense that a person’s capabilities continuously adapt to new and changing contexts; thus there is a built-in expectation of reflective practice and continuous learning.",

In traditional group learning, students work in groups with no attention paid to group functioning, whereas in cooperative learning, group work is carefully prepared, planned, and monitored. Four key strategies in cooperative are: problem solving, decision making, critical thinking, and creative thinking. Most research studies have found that cooperative is more effective than other modes of instruction for higher level tasks, although this has not been the case in all studies. A number of theoretical perspectives (and associated cooperative activities) underlie work in cooperative learning, such as social psychology (Jigsaw technique), developmental psychology (Cooperative Controversy, Pairs Check), cognitive psychology (MURDER--Mood, Understand, Recall, Detect, Elaborate, and Review), motivation theory (STAD--Student Teams Achievement Divisions), multiple intelligences theory (Talking Chips), humanistic psychology (group investigation), and global education/moral values education.

The objective is to have students work cooperatively in small groups to ,attain academic as well as affective and social goals. In hundreds of studies, cooperative has been associated with gains in such variables as achievement, interpersonal skills, and attitudes toward school, self, and others (for reviews, see (Cohen, 1994; Johnson & Johnson, 1989; Sharan, 1980, Slavin, 1990). Beyond these overall gains, research also suggests that cooperative may lead to gains in skills (Johnson & Johnson, 1990; Qin, Johnson, & Johnson, 1995). Therefore, as classroom organisation and instructional method, cooperative merits serious consideration for use in classrooms. Indeed, several skills programmes, such as Dimensions of Learning (Marzano, 1992), recommend that their programmes be implemented with the use of cooperative groups. In this paper, the following key questions will be examined. What is distinctive about cooperative learning, which makes it different from just groupwork? What has research found about the effectiveness of cooperative in promoting thinking? What conditions in cooperative help promote thinking? What theoretical perspectives support the thinking link? What is distinctive about cooperative learning? Cooperative is more than just groupwork. A key difference between cooperative and traditional group work is that in the latter, BEST COPY AVAILABLE 2 1 students are asked to work in groups with no attention paid to group functioning, whereas in cooperative learning, group work is carefully prepared, planned, and monitored (Jacobs, 1997; Johnson & Johnson, 1994; Ng & Lee, 1996). Instructional models and structures have been designed, which teachers can adopt and adapt, to help the group work operate more effectively by creating an environment for interactive (Abrami et al, 1995). Several conditions that promote cooperation are seen as criterial elements of cooperative (Johnson & Johnson, 1990) clearly perceived positive interdependence (the feeling among group members that what helps one member helps all and what hurts one hurts all); face-to-face promotive interaction (students need to be interacting with one another, not just members of the same group); individual accountability (each group member feels responsible for their own and for helping their groupmates learn); the teaching of collaborative skills; and group processing (groups spending time discussing the dynamics of their interaction and how they can be improved. A cooperative lesson often begins with some direct instruction where the teacher presents new material. This is followed by cooperative groupwork. During the group work, students often take on roles in order to help them feel responsible for participating and learning. The teacher monitors groups to see that they are and functioning smoothly. Team spirit is stressed with students learning how to by participation with their peers (Adams & Hamm, 1990; Kagan, 1994). Teachers who use cooperative have objectives that are academic, affective, and social. Students are encouraged not to think only of their individual but of their group members as well. Cooperation becomes a theme, not just teaching technique (Jacobs, 1997). Further, cooperation features throughout the school, e.g., teachers cooperate with one another and let their students know about this collaboration. Communication is structured very differently in cooperative classes. Because students learn in collaboration, they consequently engage in extensive verbal negotiations with their peers. The cooperative group provides more intimate setting that permits such direct and unmediated communication (Shachar & Sharan, 1994). Such context, proponents of cooperative believe, is key to students engaging in real discussion and wrestling with ideas. In this context then, students will be given opportunities to stretch and extend their thinking. What is thinking? There is such variety of definitions of that any attempt to define it will be incomplete. We shall in this section articulate only few 2",

      "abstract": "Adaptation means accommodation of a living organism to constantly changing conditions external and internal environments. This capacity was developed in the process of the evolutionary development. Absent of this capacity, no human organism can leave normally or adjust to various external factors.In the contemporary research literature, adaptation is associated with different factors, including occupation, climate, social environment, etc. The process of adaptation is complex, and it contemplates different types of adaptation, namely, individual sociopsychological, communicative, and physiological adaptation. It is accompanied by substantial intellectual, mental and physical efforts.The variety of building structures coupled with process-related and organizational methods of their construction require attention to the issues of safety. In the course of life and work (working environment), a person is exposed to various hazards or phenomena, processes, and objects capable of damaging human health under certain conditions. An occupational hazard means an adverse impact on human health in the form of its deterioration or injury under certain conditions.The studies show that the three-shift working activity is the cause of fatigue. Fatigue boosts errors in the sensomotor coordination and deteriorates human health. The daily rhythm of physiological functions is driven by the intensity of the working activity causing changes in the body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure. Harmful factors, such as chlorine and chlorine dioxide, produce negative impact on the psycho-physiological status of the organism. They are countered by the system of adaptation and rehabilitation as an integral part of the university curriculum. Its objective is to enhance the effectiveness of professional activities, to ensure the optimal functioning of a human body exposed to heavy workloads and adverse external conditions.",

      "title": "Defining mental health literacy: a systematic literature review and educational inspiration",
      "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to explore how the term “mental health literacy” (MHL) is defined and understand the implications for public mental health and educational interventions. Design/methodology/approach An extensive search was conducted by searching PubMed, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. Keywords such as “mental health literacy” and “definition” were used. The publication year ranges from 1997 to 2023. Findings In total, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. Three distinct themes characterise the definitions of MHL: cognitive understanding; affective empowerment; and behavioural change. In the mental health educational context, inspiration, transformation and practice can be viewed as three stages for curriculum development. Research limitations/implications Despite conducting a systematic literature review, there remains the possibility that certain relevant studies may not have been identified. Specifically, the selection criteria prioritise papers that explicitly addressed MHL. Practical implications Traditional educational approaches prioritise knowledge dissemination and attitude change; integrating MHL into mental health well-being curriculum advocates for action-oriented intervention to address mental health challenges. Social implications Understanding different definitions and concepts in a field can be valuable for consolidating shared understandings, highlighting tensions and contradictions, and enhancing communication among researchers. Ironically, perhaps, the process also highlights the provisional nature of these definitions. Originality/value The exploration of MHL with three themes of definitions sheds light on the understanding of this concept. Three core themes in MHL definitions guide future curriculum development. This study underscores the importance of prioritise action-oriented intervention in mental health education, emphasising the need to move beyond knowledge dissemination towards transformative practices that promote holistic mental well-being.",

      "title": "Wisdom and Intelligence: The Nature and Function of Knowledge in the Later Years",
      "abstract": "Intelligence can be defined as the ability to think logically, to conceptualize and abstract from reality. Wisdom can be defined as the ability to grasp human nature, which is paradoxical, contradictory, and subject to continual change. These two constructs hold potential for highlighting positive and adaptive features of development in the later years. Both are considered to increase with age, and both provide for life-long acquisition of knowledge. Despite these phenotypic similarities, this paper attempts to illustrate that the nature of wisdom and its function in the developmental process differs sufficiently from cognitive ability to warrant separate scrutiny. These two constructs are compared with respect to the domains of behavior they represent, the operational tasks used to assess them, and the relationship of logic and time in their development. The function of intelligence is characterized as focusing on questions of how to do and accomplish necessary life-supporting tasks; the function of wisdom is characterized as provoking the individual to consider the consequences of his actions both to self and their effects on others. Wisdom, therefore, evokes questions of should one pursue a particular course of action.",

      "title": "Trends and Determinants of Mental Health During COVID-19 Pandemic",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Mental health refers to the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being of an individual. Mental health is an essential component of health necessary for the effective functioning of an individual. It helps to determine the way we handle stress and make choices. Mental health is not only important in childhood. It is very important in childhood, adolescence, and throughout adulthood. Good mental health can preserve a person's ability to enjoy life. Preserving good mental health helps an individual to balance between life activities, efforts, and responsibilities to achieve psychological resilience.[1] World Health Organization (WHO) relates mental well-being of an individual with the realization of individual's abilities, coping, productivity, and social contribution.[2] WHO states mental health as \"subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others.\"[3] Mental health of an individual is not static, it changes from time to time. There are multiple factors that can constrain mental health. Mental illness refers to the health conditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior associated with distress or impaired functioning. Mental health and mental illness are continuous and related concepts. The people who do not have mental illness can have poor mental health. Likewise, people with optimal mental health can have a mental illness.[4] Issues with mental health disorders are of huge health concern. These affect the thinking, feeling, mood, or behavior of an individual and can contribute to the development of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, bipolar mood disorder, or schizophrenia. When developed, the illness can be acute or chronic and it affects social, emotional, and occupational functioning. An estimated >50% of individuals will have a mental illness or disorder during their lifetime.[5] Research says 20% (one in five) of the children, have had a seriously debilitating mental disorder. Globally 10% to 20% of children and adolescents suffer from mental illness.[6] Mental health can be affected during pandemics and epidemics at large. The most common pandemics seen in the past were plague, influenza, cholera, smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, HIV, and the current Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). These infectious diseases have ruined human life and have changed histories. The current pandemic, the world faces is the outbreak of COVID-19. It is stressful for people and it triggers overwhelming and strong emotions in adults and children. Fear and anxiety about their health status, changes in sleeping or eating patterns, and abuse of drugs are the commonest concerns and it affects the mental health.[7] Changes in lifestyle routine and lack of physical contact with other family members and friends disturb the people at large. The growth and development of children may be affected drastically if are not taken care of. Hence, at this crucial point, it is important to raise concern over the mental health of people. Effective interventions need to be planned and delivered to avoid issues of mental health concern during this pandemic. COVID-19 PANDEMIC Infectious diseases are usually coined with words such as \"pandemic,\" \"epidemic,\" and \"endemic\" based on the nature of their occurrence. A pandemic is defined as \"an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.\" The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was initially an epidemic when it was limited to Wuhan, China but because of its geographical spread, it turned out to be a pandemic. WHO declared it as a pandemic to gather political and financial support across nations.[8] Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that originated in China. The symptoms range from common cold to respiratory distress. This is more similar to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). This is also called SARS-CoV2. The current disease pandemic is due to this virus and it demands cautious pandemic preparedness. The clinical features include fever, cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.[8] World is worried about the alarming spread and severity of the COVID-19 disease. Rational, proportionate, and reasonable measures are needed to contain this public health crisis. QUARANTINE A pandemic outbreak warns people about a disaster that may endanger a large cluster of human species if unattended. Being negligent, fearless, and unresponsive paves the way to loss of morality, human life, and social functioning. There are numerous measures taken by WHO and are followed across the globe with caution. Quarantine is one such method that separates and restricts individuals to be exposed to COVID-19. Quarantine prevents community transmission and may be done at home or in a facility. Quarantine isolates the asymptomatic healthy persons who may have been exposed to the COVID-19. The quarantine period for COVID 19 is usually 14 days from the date of last exposure. Currently, one-third of the world's population is in quarantine.9 LOCKDOWN The world grapples with managing the new pandemic and it is a stressful time for people across nations. Lockdown has been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of the virus. The terms lockdown or shutdown are being used by many to describe more general and widespread restrictions on movement, work, and travel on all people in a city, region, or country.[9] PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN Under-five children Parents of the under-five children are stressed and worried about the children's growth and development. As the under-five developmental stage of the child is centered on neurological development, stress is being placed on parents to enable them to explore and learn from the green environment. However, this process is affected extremely during this COVID-19 pandemic. School-going children Huge concerns and worries are experienced by the parents about the well-being of the school-age children. A recent survey was done on 5000 parents by the Co-SPACE (Covid-19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents, and Children in Epidemics). The study aimed to assess the mental health of school-aged children aged 4 to 15 years. The findings revealed that 50% of the parents' were concerned and worried about the welfare and well-being of their children. Eighty percent of the parents felt the lockdown to be stressful as they could not control the behavior of the children. School children easily develop frustration and boredom. Children confined to home are often irritated and more demanding. Their academic achievements are halted and they become socially detached.[10] Interventions are needed to improve the mental health of school-going children. Adolescents The mental health of adolescents is disturbed to a greater extent. Restrictions imposed by the pandemic has induced a huge amount of pressure on the adolescents as they are away from their normal routine. Health and well-being are also affected. Being confined to a space is more stressful. There is a distortion in the family and social relationships. Information overload makes them feel trapped and creates undue anxiety. They lack access to the outside world that makes them get obsessed with electronic gadgets. Psychiatric emergencies such as suicide, altruism, paranoid behavior, aggression, and panic attacks are commonly seen among adolescents.[10] Besides the common mental health issues of adolescents, adolescents having chronic life-threatening illnesses face many challenges in coping up with their illness during this pandemic. These adolescents experience additional burdens and risks related to their health. Therefore, comprehensive health care interventions should be adopted by practitioners in caring for children with chronic illness to improve their quality of life.[11] Adults Stress has become a part and parcel of life after the corona era. Social distancing, fear of acquiring the infection, and prevention strategies practiced are causing enormous stress among adults. Adults are always on the watch in reducing the chances of acquiring the COVID-19 infection. Frequent checking, hoarding, and washing compulsion are a few of the obsessions that are developed during this period. Fear over losing loved ones cause immense anxiety and stress. The adults get detached from society and are at risk of developing mental health issues. The common mental health problems faced are depression, anxiety, and panic disorder.[12] In addition to the common mental health problems in adults, studies have reported poor quality of life in the psychological and physical domain in the caregivers having family members with chronic disorders.[13] Therefore, enhancing the psychological well-being of adults during this COVID-19 pandemic is very essential. Primary and secondary preventive measures must be taken while caring for the pregnant, postnatal mothers, and their newborns.[14] Pregnant women Stress and anxiety levels in pregnant women increases during the infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID- 19 outbreak. The pregnant women may experience anxiety and stress pertaining to the potential adverse obstetrical outcomes including fetal abnormalities and fetal death. Isolation, social distancing, and various changes in daily life increase the risk of depression among pregnant women. Saccone et al.[15] conducted a study to evaluate the psychological impact and anxiety in pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The study reported that the majority of the respondents rated their psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as severe and most of the pregnant women reported that they experience higher than normal levels of anxiety. The pregnant women had higher levels of anxiety regarding the vertical transmission of the disease to the fetus. The anxiety and psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic was very severe in pregnant women during the first trimester of their pregnancy.[15] Ravaldi et al.[16] reported that Italian pregnant women are very much concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their baby, partner, and elderly relatives. The pregnant women are experiencing worry, fear, loneliness, anxiety, and danger during this COVID- 19 outbreak.[16] During pregnancy, maintenance of adequate physical and mental health is of paramount importance as pregnancy may increase the vulnerability to depression. Elderly The emotional, mental, and physical health of the elderly is at higher risk. The fear of losing loved ones and acquiring infection makes them get detached from others. Fear of acquiring the infections makes them paranoiac. A study reported from china signifies the impact of the coronavirus on the health of individuals. The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index identified the highest stress index with mean (SD) 30.94, F = 929.306 at P < 0.001. The study also reported psychological problems such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression, and physical health issues among the elderly.[17] COVID-19 PANDEMIC, QUARANTINE, AND LOCKDOWN TRENDS IN INDIA The first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 30, 2020, in India. India has the largest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Asia and the world. As of July 17, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in India is 1 000 000.[18] Dramatic changes such as quarantine, lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation have been the recent trends in this COVID era. The prolonged lockdown has affected the economy and the wealth of the nation. The COVID-19 pandemic in India is one of the worst-hit pandemics among the earlier seen pandemics. There is a scarcity of human resources to fight against this deadly disease. The public is worried about the data transparency of the government with regard to its morbidity and mortality rate. Information bombarding by the news broadcasting services and social media promoting unverified news makes people nervous and catastrophic in this situation. GLOBAL TRENDS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC, QUARANTINE, AND LOCKDOWN World Health Organization has declared COVID 19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the end of January 2020 due to its fast-spreading nature and its effect on the health of people at the community level.[19] According to a study, COVID-19 is an unpredictable infectious disease and the outcome is poor.[20] The progress of the disease is unclear and there are no drugs for the cure. In a global estimate, 28 countries were surveyed wherein 21 countries imported the virus before quarantine and seven countries post quarantine. It also emphasizes the need to strengthen interventions for disease monitoring and control.[21] DETERMINANTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, QUARANTINE, AND LOCKDOWN World Federation for Mental Health states \"Mental health as a precious commodity and an asset that should be prioritized in the same way as physical health.\" Pandemic, quarantine, and lockdown have brought a monumental challenge for children, adults, and the elderly. Job loss and financial distress create stress among the public. The infodemics spread across the global media are mostly unreliable and cause panic among the public. The myths regarding the virus and its spread confuse the common man.[22] Health practices such as frequent hand washing, masking, and social isolation hamper the individuality of a person. Some of them become more obsessive to perform these rituals and get themselves disconnected from reality. Issues related to mental health problems are on the rise during this crisis. Trauma-related mental health disorder is the current area of concern focused by mental health professionals. Depression and avoidance personality disorder is also a common mental health problem.[22] People are not able to access rehabilitation services, socialization activities, and daycare centers. Educational assistance and personal support services are chiefly affected during this pandemic as innovative remote mental health services are unavailable. Most of the psychiatric hospital units have been converted into COVID-19 units and many of the community mental health centers have been closed. As the outpatient services are limited only to emergency cases, there is a limited service to people. Although in some countries, mobile teams are available to assist the psychosocial needs of people, such health care services are not equally distributed across the globe.[22] The disabled and fragile people are experiencing outbreaks in the health care facility. In many countries, there is very little opportunity for self-isolation due to limited space. The caregivers of patients with severe mental illness battle to cope without adequate and necessary support including counseling, respite care, and support. The people are getting exposed to viruses due to a lack of facilities for self-isolation, and living in congested communities. Homeless people are affected as they lack basic support systems.[22] In low- and middle-income countries, mental health care is already limited that is a major concern during the pandemic. The places such as mental hospitals, nursing homes, social care homes, halfway homes, and other institutions are at risk as these places are at increased risk of contracting the virus. As mentally ill patients have cognitive disabilities, they do not know to avoid the spread of infection. The migrant populations living in the camps are socially disadvantaged and they contract the illness more quickly.[22] Although feeding camps and food relief measures are available in all the countries, the need for health protection and psychosocial support is highly essential during this pandemic. Therefore, proactive measures and actions to address the physical, mental health, and social needs to be taken. Also, economical and psychosocial needs must be met. An emergency mental health plan should be drafted. The government should implement a centralized plan to care for the psychosocial and mental health problems of people during this pandemic. IMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC, QUARANTINE, AND LOCKDOWN ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE A recent web-based survey identified posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms as mental health issues due to the corona crisis.[23] Social distancing, lockdown, and stay-at-home policy have worsened the vulnerability of mental health. People are experiencing serious psychological effects including frustration, anxiety, depression, and boredom with posttraumatic symptoms.[24] The number of domestic violence reported to police increased to 13% in Taiwan.[25] The children with preexisting comorbidities have developed novel neuropsychiatric symptoms due to prolonged social distancing.[26] In Spain, females reported to have severe loneliness and distress than males during the lockdown period of COVID-19.[27] Two different studies have reported that older people had poorer clinical features and prognosis than younger ones if being infected with COVID-19.[2829] A recent study reported that the stay-at-home measure due to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected internet use and gaming behavior among treatment seekers.[30] The medical health care workers with somatic disorders, workers in contact with COVID-19 patients, and female workers were at higher risk of developing anxiety, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.[31] Qi et al.[32] reported that anxiety was more common and prevalent among female adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak suggesting timely screening and appropriate interventions to reduce the anxiety in adolescents.[32] In a systematic review, Xiong et al.[33] explored the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general population. The review reported that higher rates of symptoms of anxiety were found in 6.33% to 50.9% of the general population, depression in 14.6% to 48.3%, psychological distress in 34.43% to 38%, posttraumatic stress disorder in 7% to 53.8%, and stress in 8.1% to 81.9% of the general population during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, China, Italy, Turkey, Iran, the United States, Nepal, and Denmark. The distress was reported to be higher in females, younger age group <40 years, presence of psychiatric and chronic illness, unemployment, students, and frequent exposure to social media and news related to COVID-19.33 It is noticed in general that children face many psychological issues including stress, anxiety, and depression due to online education. This occurs due to limited socialization. Research should be directed to identify the psychological problems of children with online education during this COVID-19 pandemic. The parents too have expressed that they are unable to monitor their children in their online education. It poses many concerns to the parents and family members. The educational institutions are facing challenges and are unable to predict the opening of schools. Further research is needed to explore the psychosocial needs and problems of people across all ages and the interventions to reduce the occurrence of psychosocial and mental illness in people. STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, QUARANTINE, AND LOCKDOWN There is a need for more evidence-based information regarding the mental health issues during this pandemic. Myth busters regarding the pandemic must be promoted. There is a need for establishing public health communication networks. Media and community awareness is the need of the hour. Governments should coordinate and communicate with agencies to promote mental health during the pandemic situation. Support can be sought from global organizations such as the WHO, United Nations Children's Fund, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Centers for Disease Control, or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), and the Government of India for matters of international concern. Updating the strategies practiced by the World Health Organizations, the governmental and local authorities ensure the spreading of accurate information and help breaking the myths.[34] A comprehensive framework needs to be planned to overcome the mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Disseminating platforms regarding COVID needs to be tailor-made according to the geographical background, culture, and virus virulence. Care must be taken to spread legitimate information. Nations must reinforce and necessitate the need for being in isolation or quarantine. Strategies improving mental and psychosocial well-being during the outbreak must be communicated. Empathetic and compassionate care is essential for people with COVID. Information technology and social media must be scrutinized before they spread information. Positive thinking and resilience can improve mental health. Listening, responding, and reacting to children during this pandemic would be helpful. Recommendations provided by qualified health professionals must be considered.[34]Online services for counseling and mental health through nongovernmental agencies should be facilitated. Fear, anger, anxiety, isolation, and panic must be monitored and addressed through hotlines. Relapse of already existing mental illness must be prevented through community follow-up.[35] Education of the family and rehabilitation must be planned and executed through online services. Coping strategies can be taught to people with a poor coping mechanism. Telemedicine consultation practice must be encouraged and people must be made aware of such services.[36] Post-COVID psychological intervention must be formulated to treat the aftermath. The involvement of mental health professionals in the COVID team will prevent the mental health crisis. Preparing the frontline personnel to deal with mental health problems is essential.[37] Screening of mental health problems through rating scales and inventories helps identify mental health issues at an early stage. Community resources such as media, advertising, and allocation of funds will help fight the fragile situation caused by COVID. Higher social support may decrease the uncertain and fearful feeling in the pandemic and increase confidence in coping with COVID-19. Health professionals should develop alternative ways such as telephone visits to provide social support for the public, especially for those who are quarantined. CONCLUSION It is high time to build a more sustainable world for a living. Each and every individual must be socially responsible and must follow guidelines as laid by the governmental organizations. They must be enlightened about the disease and the ways to control it. Mental health and its impact on psychosocial performance need to be closely monitored. Mental health policies must be framed and structured to meet the trends of the current situation. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

These are only some of the questions they have asked themselves. The vagueness of the term’s significance has determined the psychologists to reorient towards more remote scientific fields of research which could lead to more and more interesting answers. The concept of intelligence commonly refers to the general mental capacities such as language, thinking, memory and perception but also to sensorial and moving abilities. A person’s intelligence quotient reveals its ability to analyse, rationalise and solve problems, as well as the individual ability to adapt to new tendencies and challenges that may appear in the course of life. Given the complexity of the situations of communication, the scientists were determined to research other base abilities which every person possesses in certain amounts. The concept of intelligence covers different realities and constitutes the fundament on which multiple intelligence concept bases. Being intelligent means using others intelligence as well.",

      "title": "Intrapsychic Impediments to Effective Leadership",
      "abstract": "The psychological underpinnings of effective leadership depend on the synergy of the id, ego, and superego. Effective leadership requires an ego that is flexible, resilient to changing situations, and sensitive to interpersonal cues, with cognitive and intellectual capacities to understand business and corporate challenges. It must channel drives, especially active ones, into assertive, but thoughtful, action. As well, the ego must be able to regulate impulse expression, tolerate frustration, and work toward goals. The superego contributions include goal setting, aspiring to ideals, and playing by the rules. It must help maintain a consistent, but not overly harsh, attitude toward the self and its actions. Leadership grows, too, from learning and from identifications, both conscious and unconscious, with significant models from both childhood and adulthood. It includes a healthy regulation of narcissism that can maintain stable self-esteem in the face of failure and criticism, both from within and without. Sound object relations are also necessary, especially those that allow for an experience of objects that includes awareness of their actual (as opposed to their transference distorted) qualities. The object representations should be multifaceted enough to allow recognition simultaneously of the assets and limitations of the same person. This synergy on which effective leadership depends can be shaped and distorted by intrapsychic conflict and unconscious fantasies. Freud (1916) Freud, S. 1916.

      "abstract": "Abstract.ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS AND PLANNING. KEYS TO INTERPRETATION OF FAILURE AND ACADEMIC ABANDONMENTAcademic expectations represent what students expect to achieve during their training. They are linked to previous experiences and events, in accordance with which forecasts about what will happen are made. If the expected events occur, the foreseen behavior will be carried out, such that expectations influence behavior and play an adaptive role of adjustment or maladjustment to academic reality. Planning has been defined as a hierarchical process that can control the order in which one performs a sequence of operations. The plan controls human information processing and the essential patterns of connections between knowledge, evaluation, and action. Academic adaptation in the different learning contexts is influenced by personal, academic, and social factors that cause many students to perceive many difficulties and make their adaptation more difficult. These students’ adaptation is still more difficult when the perceived difficulties are accompanied by their few coping strategies and by lack of support from the institutions. From a multi-dimensional conception of academic expectations (training for employment, personal and social development, student mobility, political/citizen involvement, social pressure, quality of training, and social interaction), a predictive model has been established in freshmen university students, with planning as a predictor of these expectations. The obtained predictive model provides an approach to the relationship between the strategies of problem solving, life goals, and academic expectations of freshman university students, which constitute key pieces in their academic success. At the same time, it allows a possible interpretation of academic failure and academic dropout, as well as of learning difficulties and problems adapting to the university context, and to other contexts and educational stages.Keywords: Academic expectations, planning, adaptation, academic success, academic failure, academic dropout.Resumen.Las expectativas académicas representan aquello que los estudiantes esperan alcanzar durante su formación. Están vinculadas con las experiencias y acontecimientos previos vividos, de acuerdo a los cuales se hacen previsiones sobre lo que sucederá. Si se producen los hechos anticipados se ejecutará la conducta prevista, por lo que las expectativas influencian la conducta y desempeñan un papel adaptativo de ajuste o no a la realidad académica. La planificación se ha definido como un proceso jerárquico que puede controlar el orden en el que se realiza una secuencia de operaciones. El plan controla el procesamiento de la información humana y las pautas de conexiones esenciales entre conocimiento, evaluación y acción. La adaptación académica, en los distintos contextos de aprendizaje, está influenciada por factores personales, académicos y sociales que hacen que muchos estudiantes perciban muchas dificultades y les sea dificultosa tal adaptación. Más difícil es aún la adaptación, cuando las dificultades percibidas van acompañadas de pocas estrategias de afrontamiento por parte de los estudiantes y por falta de apoyo por parte de las instituciones. Desde una concepción multidimensional de las expectativas académicas (formación para el empleo, desarrollo personal y social, movilidad estudiantil, implicación político/ciudadana, presión social, calidad de formación e interacción social), se ha establecido un modelo de predicción en estudiantes universitarios de primer año con la planificación como predictor de dichas expectativas. El modelo de predicción obtenido ofrece una aproximación al vínculo existente entre las estrategias de solución de problemas, los objetivos de vida y las expectativas académicas de los estudiantes universitarios de primer año, que constituyen piezas clave en su éxito académico. Al mismo tiempo permite una posible interpretación del fracaso y abandono académico, así como de las dificultades de aprendizaje y adaptación al contexto universitario y en otros contextos y etapas educativas.Palabras clave: expectativas académicas, planificación, adaptación, éxito académico, fracaso académico, abandono académico.",

      "title": "Examination and Evaluation Tests and Measures",
      "abstract": "The use of standardized norm-referenced and criterion-referenced tests and measures has become a mainstay in the day-to-day practice of the physical therapist and occupational therapist. These instruments may be used to determine a baseline level of performance to qualify a child for therapy services, measure the child's performance over time, or to predict future performance. The type of instrument used is based on the type of information needed at the time the child is examined and an assessment is performed. Additionally, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health—Children and Youth (ICF–CY) model,1 the instrument selected is based on whether the assessment is at the level of body functions and structures, activities, or participation. Body Functions and Structures is defined as the physiological functions of body systems and anatomical elements such as organs, limbs, and their components. Impairments are problems in body function, such as a significant deviation or loss. Measures of Body Functions and Structures might include assessment of sensory functions and pain, neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related structures and functions, and function and structure of the cardiovascular system. Activities and Abilities are defined as the execution of specific tasks or actions by an individual. Activity Limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing these tasks and actions. Participation is defined as involvement in a life situation. Participation Restrictions are problems an individual may experience in day-to-day life activities. Measures of Activities and Participation might include assessment of learning and applying knowledge, communication, mobility, self-care, interpersonal interaction and relationships, and community and social life. Another way to view the ICF model is that \"body functions and structures\" is functioning at the level of the body; \"activities\" is functioning at the level of the individual; and \"participation\" is the functioning of an individual as a member of society. ICF–CY terminology would be used in describing a child in the following example: A child who has dyspraxia may have low muscle tone (a body functions and structures problem), difficulty walking a narrow aisle at school (an activity limitation), and may be unable to play with classmates during recess (a participation restriction). Thus, tests and measures are used initially to identify impairments and activity limitations or participation restrictions in the child; then to help establish a diagnosis, prognosis, and plan of care; and, finally, to select appropriate interventions.",

      "abstract": "People’s activities vary dynamically from moment to moment, and analysis of level of skill complexity in successive activities provides a tool to portray and analyze variation as skills are learned. Systematic examination of these variations is crucial for illuminating the dynamic nature of learning and development – the ways that people construct activities under the influence of multiple factors interacting in complex ways, in context, over time. A study of adults learning to use a computer program illustrates three important patterns in the dynamic variation of adult cognitive microdevelopment: (1) each person’s performance levels vary within a range between upper and lower attractors during dynamic construction of a skill. (2) Performance moves through different pathways from a novice pattern to a transitional pattern characterized by scalloping (repeated building up and collapse of complex performance) to an expert pattern. Social scaffolding plays an important role in moving a learner toward the upper attractor. (3) Each person functions at diverse levels depending on demands of the task, domain, background, scaffolding, and capacity and thus shows asynchrony in level, not simple consistency. Tasks and situations attract specific skill levels that are often below people’s highest capacities. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel People’s activities vary widely in content and complexity, not only across longterm developmental epochs but also from moment to moment. Analysis of the pervasive variability in people’s activities potentially provides new data for analyzing processes of change in learning and development.

      "title": "Identifying Children Who May Be Cognitively Gifted: The Gap between Practical Demands and Scientific Supply",
      "abstract": "When it comes to high cognitive ability assessment, traditional “IQ-diagnosis” has not proven to be particularly helpful. Psychological assessment aimed at promoting the development of gifted individuals requires a scientifically based theoretical model that identifies which cognitive strengths are necessary and which weaknesses can be compensated, and that takes the moderating effects of personality and environment into account when describing the interplay between ability and achievement. While such models – including the one described in the following paper – do exist, they currently lack an adequate theoretical foundation or at least a convincing empirical validation. Science still stands before the challenge of offering appropriate psycho-diagnostic instruments to measure model components while fulfilling practitioners’ requirements. The following work describes a prototypic example of how such requirements might be met for ability testing. Yet in terms of personality and environmental variables, particularly caregiving, currently available methods are wholly unsuitable for meeting intended goals. Systematic behavioral observation offers a possible solution. Its validity, objectivity, comprehensiveness and efficiency in terms of high ability testing – as well as that of interview guides – must, however, be further explored.",

In all of these specialities, assessments contribute to diagnostic decisions, and are used to identify patients' assets and handicaps, to facilitate the selection of treatment goals and to monitor progress and change and responses to therapy. The relevance of assessments will be related to the influence which they have on decisions and action, and psychologists will usually be keen to identify clinically relevant questions before they undertake any assessments of intellectual functioning, memory, social competence, vocational interests or other aspects of personality. For example, what is the patient's current intellectual level, and is there any indication that this has changed? Has there been any deterioration?

The self is so integrated into teacher–student interactions that one is less conscious of how it shapes one's thoughts, emotions and action; and often goes unexamined. Self‐awareness and self‐observation are proposed to be an essential part of the process of reflection. Illustrated with case examples from the author's personal exploration, strategies such as 'distancing' and attention to one's 'automatic thoughts' are discussed to facilitate self‐reflection.

      "abstract": "Learned helplessness is a phenomenon that occurs when people are repeatedly exposed to situations over which they do not have control. When adults believe that it is impossible to influence outcomes, many will stop trying. Likewise, many instances exist in which children are unable to control events in their environment. Because this feeling of lack of control may be exaggerated by physical, mental, or emotional reasons, adults and children often fail to recognize opportunities for control when they arise. Whether the lack of control is real or imagined, the results are equally devastating. Once children develop learned helplessness behaviors, they are reluctant to attempt the initial task in which failure was experienced and tend to avoid related activities. In addition to avoidance of activities, other behaviors displayed are listlessness, passivity, depression, lack of motivation, and negative beliefs about oneself and abilities. Another characteristic of children who develop learned helplessness is a difficulty in seeing relationships between responses and outcomes. As a result, many children do not recognize the successes that they have achieved, whereas, on the other hand, they take personal responsibility for all perceived failures. In short, if children start to believe that experienced failures are indicative of their future performance, they will develop learned helplessness and stop attempting to influence outcomes. In this article we explore the topic of learned helplessness in children as well as counselor strategies for helping",

In this article, child language development is taken as a (neutral) field in which to contemplate the nature of knowledge, and three generalizations about knowledge are formulated and exemplified from data on language acquisition: (1) Becoming knowledgeable about any complex domain requires a balance between going beyond the known and being constrained by what experts have already discovered; (2) In the right environment, one can perform quite skillfully despite quite low levels of autonomous competence; nonetheless, skilled performance is typically poorer than one’s level of knowledge about how to perform would predict; (3) The capacity to reflect on and analyze one’s knowledge emerges only after considerable knowledge has been accumulated and embedded into practice. The reflections of skilled practitioners in any field deserve to be systematized so that personal knowledge can become publicly accessible and subject to analysis.",

      "abstract": "Accessible Summary People with intellectual disability are often described as “vulnerable” or a “vulnerable group.” The paper focuses on vulnerability as part of an ethical discussion in research. The paper says that people with intellectual disability are not necessarily more vulnerable than others in all areas of life but, like everyone else, experience many social contexts that may or may not place them in vulnerable positions. The paper is concerned with how the negative attributes often related to the label intellectual disability and vulnerability affect the decisions and views of researchers. Abstract Background People with intellectual disability are often defined as a vulnerable group. The feminist philosopher Jackie Scully argues that vulnerability is often associated with qualities such as immaturity, helplessness, victimhood, passivity and so forth. As research is a social activity, the qualities associated with vulnerability affect researchers’ decisions about who to include and exclude from their research project as well as influencing their interpretations of the research participants’ answers, behaviour and actions. This may result in excluding people with intellectual disability from research or that their ways of being becomes interpreted as mere symptoms of their diagnosis rather than subjective opinions and experiences. Conclusion By addressing these issues through the work of Norwegian philosopher Hans Skjervheim, this paper contests traditional interpretations of vulnerability and instead argues that vulnerability should be related more specifically to each individual research project and prompt questions such as: How do we protect these particular participants from harm?",

      "abstract": "The urgency of the problem is caused by the fact that in human activity it is impossible to find such a situation, in which the anticipation would not play a significant role. Forecasting can relate and apply to different aspects of life of the subject; it may equally apply to both future changes of the human environment, and changes of social status, certain norms of behavior, self-control, control of his own actions and actions of other people. The aim of the article is to implement the theoretical analysis of the development of ideas about the anticipatory function of mental reflection. The leading approach to the study of this issue are the provisions of system-functional approach of anticipation as a phenomenon that permeates all levels of psychic reflection of reality and having a multi-level structure. The analysis of the phenomenon of anticipation indicates that it pervades all forms and levels of psychic reflection of reality, has adaptive - maladaptive nature, and in conditions of mental or psychic insolvency anticipation inconsistency is observed. The materials of the article may be useful for school psychologists.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the authors have chosen to take a closer look at a socio-emotional behavioral condition known as Inappropriate Behavior or Feelings Disorder (IBFD) which is listed in the Educator’s Diagnostic Manual of Disabilities and Disorders (EDM; Pierangelo & Guiliani, 2007). The term (or IBFD for short) used in this diagnostic manual is not found anywhere in the current literature including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). According to the EDM, under the IDEA 2004 enactment, it is one of the criteria for the classification of Emotional Disturbance (ED): “ inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances” (p.163), and it covers social, emotional, physical and psychological aspects of behavior or feelings. Hence, the term Inappropriate Behavior or Feelings Disorder is coined from this particular IDEA statement of criterion and, in turn, it is used only in the EDM multi-level coding system. The authors argued the need for educational therapists, special educators and counselors to reframe their current understanding of the IBFD, whose symptoms are similar to disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), within the context of the cognition-conation-affect-sensation (CCAS) framework as they continue to observe, record and evaluate the condition in terms of its core symptoms seen, measured and/or profiled before the diagnostic term IBFD is applied under the EDM code ED3.00.  Article visualizations:",

      "abstract": "The interest of the sociologist is primarily theoretical. That is he is interested in understanding for its own sake. He may be aware of or even concerned with the practical applicability and consequences of his findings, but at that point, he leaves the sociological frames of reference as such and moves into realms of values, beliefs and ideas that he shares with other men who are not sociologists. Research related to development work in sociology brings great challenges to sociology as an academic discipline. The challenges involve expectations to take on a role of a practitioner be it a social worker or a policy maker. While it is crucial to acknowledge and understand the concrete problems in people’s everyday lives, as well as frustration over failed operationalization of development projects, as a sociologist, one should be careful in a role aimed at delivering solutions to problems as experienced and identified in the field.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of skill-level in mathematics and the proposed activities to improve the skill-level often include only narrow area of the context of learning. Measuring the skill-level and its background variables is often targeted to traits on individual-level, such as liking mathematics, feeling of self-efficacy, or gender. To improve the individual-level traits, measures targeted to individuals, such as the use of games in mathematics teaching to improve the attitudes towards mathematics, have been suggested. However, learning happens on many contexts with different dimensions that cannot be separated from one another. An individual learns and forms concept structures in social interaction, which has been shaped by the prevailing culture. The challenges in learning mathematics should be examined from a perspective that is wider than the individual. When the mechanical increase in skill-level of an individual is scrutinized, we may forget the purpose and benefits of increasing the skill-level in comparison with the prevailing concept.",

Mental health is very important aspect of individual life. Mental Health refers to a state of wellbeing in which person realizes his/her own abilities, can manage normal stresses of life, work productively and effectively, and able to make contribution to his/her community (WHO, 2001). If the person is failed to realize his/her abilities to deal with demand of the workplace, not able to manage normal stress of workplace life then he/she may have developed some kind of mental health problems. When it comes to the workplace there are many factors which influenced the person’s mental health. Factors like, monotonous work, shift work, unclear roles, negative moods and daily hassles, due to these factors people develop some of the mental health problems such as negative affect, depression, and psychological distress. The present article also highlighted the need to organize mental health workshop at the workplace so that the mental health awareness can be spread.",

      "abstract": "AbstractSoft skills have been defined in a number of ways in the literature. They are also referred to by different names such as 'key skills', 'core skills', 'essential skills' and 'soft skills' in different countries. Though different names are given to these skills in different countries, by and large they encompass the same range of skills: communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, problem solving, reflection, critical thinking and leadership skills, self-confidence, conformity to norms, language proficiency etc. A number of studies are presented in this paper wherein need for possession of soft skills by the future workforce is emphasized. Personality plays a significant role in a job search as well as in job performance and learning. So it becomes important to examine one of the most obvious aspects of personality – extroversion versus introversion. Extroverts possess traits such as sociability, talkativeness, activeness, and assertiveness. Introverts tend to be low-key, deliberate, and relatively less engaged in social situations. Understanding and appreciating the strengths and weaknesses associated with introverted and extroverted personality styles can mean the difference between success and failure in campus placements and later at the workplace. The present study is conducted with a view to examine the performance of extrovert/introvert prospective engineers in campus placements, their perceptions of knowledge of soft skills and their views regarding activities for developing them in the institution. The recruitment process followed by some of the leading Software firms takes into account two to four of the following types of rounds: aptitude tests, technical rounds, group discussions and HR interviews. The Eysenck Personality Inventory was used to classify prospective engineers on extroversion and introversion. The introverts were found to perform better than extroverts on aptitude test. Both groups need further training in soft skills to become successful in getting jobs. Engineering institutions should pay more attention to the development of soft skills like communication skills, team building skills and interpersonal skills.",

Not every tool or practice works for every person. It takes some experimentation to learn which techniques effectively calm your fight-or-flight response and engage your rest-and-digest recovery system. Those who are willing to try might just gain a competitive edge. Mentally strong people are willing to learn new modes of self-development, adapt to our constantly changing world, take responsibility for their improvements and periodic failures, and assume control of their lives. They do not let negative environments or distractions deter them from their goals. The research-based practices here are divided into exercises that address specific obstacles to mental strength (perfectionism, imposter syndrome, pessimism, emotion regulation, and self-awareness of introversion, extroversion, and neurosignature strengths) and proactive strategies to empower your rest-and-digest system (growth mindset, mindfulness, meditation, nature therapy, creative play, and interacting with dogs).",

It illustrates how the multifaceted LSF can serve as a device for organizing and clarifying one's thinking, for integrating existing ideas and findings into a coherent picture, and for developing new ways of conceptualizing and studying significant issues regarding effective human functioning and development. Perhaps the most obvious and direct way in which the LSF was useful in formulating this study was in suggesting which social-cognitive processes should be of particular relevance in producing socially competent behavior. In LSF terminology, this conceptualization of competence focuses on the directive or goal-setting capabilities of humans. Adolescents who made a high percentage of irresponsible choices seemed to be more concerned with their personal goals than with being responsible, and appeared to be more suspectible to social-evaluative pressures.",

To study self-regulation and motivation in learning contexts as an ongoing adaptive process, situation-specific methods are needed in addition to static measures. This article presents an 'Adaptive Instrument for Regulation of Emotions' aimed at accessing students' experiences of individual and socially shared regulation of emotions in a socially challenging learning situation. The instrument, grounded in self-regulated and socially regulated learning theory, comprises four interrelated components: the socio-emotional challenges experienced in a collaborative learning situation; individual and group-level attempts to regulate the immediate emotions evoked by the challenges; the personal goals; and goal attainment pursued in that situation. The theoretical foundation of the instrument and its components are outlined and some reliability issues illustrated. The limitations but also educational potential of the instrument to understand regulation of emotions in socially challenging learning situations are discussed.",

Psychology often uses long self-report scales to measure various psychological attributes. Although they are useful in tapping into individuals’ psychological profiles, when applied in real, everyday settings to assess individual differences, people are most likely unwilling to complete them. With the pressing need to personalize digital health platforms to enhance retention and engagement, ultra-short versions of these psychological scales are needed to allow assessment of multiple attributes at the same time. We encourage regression analyses of each item, factor analyses, item response theory, ant colony optimization, and/or machine learning methods to empirically shorten psychological scales to facilitate personalization. </sec>",

      "abstract": "Adaptive human learning involves self-instruction and individually determined self-education. When human learning is restricted to the most viable options in the process of belief acquisition, subjective well-being is likely to be promoted. Useful learning is imparted through the right kind of socialization, formal education, informal and incidental learning, and psychotherapy. In each domain the function of external instruction is to foreclose dysfunctional options. This clears the way for functional self-instruction. Informal learning has always been most important. Modern life, however, is making invalid options too numerous and seductive, often initiated by the mass media. A merger of formal and informal instruction and learning is probably becoming indispensable to the acquisition of functional beliefs capable of promoting human happiness. ********** The beliefs that underlie the selection of goals, means to goals and the evaluation of action outcomes, are acquired by people in America through the integrated influence of genetic transmission, socialization, informal education, formal education and psychotherapy. Americans are sometimes well served by each of these modalities but more often they are not. The ultimate test is whether a belief contributes to the subjective well-being (SWB) of an individual; whether widely transmitted beliefs contribute to the average level of happiness. We hold that there is a loose but permanent connection between individual motivation and the desire for a sustainable surplus of positive hedonic outcomes over negative ones (Hosen, Stern, Solovey-Hosen, 2001-2; Hosen, Stern, Solovey-Hosen, in press; Hosen, 1993). Acquiring functional knowledge and beliefs is part of this process. Effective learning seems to be largely a matter of self instruction followed by regular and systematic practice. If this is true, motivation plays a central role. The teaching function may be largely a matter of foreclosing the acquisition of inaccurate and dysfunctional beliefs. This applies to elements of socialization, formal and informal education, and to psychotherapy. Socialization Socialization is the acquisition of the competencies necessary for an individual to benefit from social cooperation over a lifetime. Humans, until quite recently, lived in close physical proximity to people they had known all their lives. Children were not socialized within one- or two-parent nuclear families, in private, or among largely anonymous neighbors. Norms, values, skills and interests were organically transmitted. Younger children learned from adults and older children. Work was performed by adults in the presence of children and adulthood began earlier. Socialization was an organic part of life. Gopnick, Metzloffand Kuhl (1999) have shown that children from birth are programmed to seek experiences from which they rapidly acquire models of the physical world and of the humans with whom they interact. Much knowledge is already embodied in the structure of the brain. Almost any non-abusive physical and social environment is adequate (Bruer, 1999). Babies know what they need to learn and are attracted to learning opportunities. Socialization is most fundamentally a question of the development of emotional self-regulation. An effective strategy for caring and responsible adults whose infants are predisposed to fearfulness and who wish to foreclose the possibility of such children (Kagan, Resnick & Snidman, 1988) learning chronic withdrawal, is to reward them for accepting challenge and permitting adjustment and desensitization to mild fear (Kagan, 1994). Similarly, difficult children can be denied tantrums, aggression and blaming of others, while being generously rewarded for self-control and provided opportunities for development of prosocial attitudes (Lykken, 1999). Dominance can be denied them but leadership could be encouraged. …",

Neurological involvement may be presumed (e.g., learning disability) or identifiable (e.g., seizure disorder). In either case, possible consequences can include impaired cognitive, sensory, motor, educational, behavioral, and psychological functioning. Neuropsychological assessment provides additional information across a range of domains to aid in case conceptualization and formulation of treatment planning. There are multiple approaches that may be applied in neuropsychological assessment, as well as various measures that may be used. This chapter identifies key principles to guide neuropsychological assessment of children and adolescents consistent with ethical and professional standards. Included is a discussion of how neuropsychological assessment complements the response to intervention (RTI) movement. Some of the continuing issues with regard to measurement and additional research needed are also highlighted.",

      "title": "Psychopathy and answerability",
      "abstract": "There is more consensus among psychiatrists than there once was about the identifying characteristics of psychopathy: about the dimensions of affect, of moral concern, of lasting relationships, and of long-term prudence that seem to be missing from a psychopath's life. However, my concern here is not with psychiatric definitions of psychopathy, or with the explanations (genetic, developmental, or neurological) that psychologists or psychiatrists might offer of psychopathy. My concern, like that of other philosophers who find the figure of the psychopath puzzling or challenging, or a useful weapon in a philosophical dispute, is with responsibility; but the question of responsibility, of the criteria by which it should be determined, is not a psychiatric question, or one on which psychiatrists or psychologists can claim expertise. It is a question about the criteria that should structure the various practices in which responsibility is attributed, argued, accepted, or rejected (practices that include but are not limited to our moral interactions and the criminal law); it is therefore an ethical question, whose answer depends upon an understanding of those practices, of the principles by which they are structured, and of the conditions that make it appropriate or inappropriate to include someone within them (or to exclude someone from them). Once we have a clear conception of what it is to be or not to be, a responsible agent who can participate in these practices, we can look to psychiatry and to other scientific disciplines for expert advice in diagnosis and (if we are lucky) treatment; but the question of what it is that requires diagnosis, explanation and treatment – which is the question that concerns me here – is an ethical rather than a scientific question.I will argue that there is logical space for a species of non-responsibility that is very like psychopathy as it is often portrayed, which I will therefore call ‘psychopathy’ in this chapter. By talking of ‘logical space’ I mean that we can describe a condition that largely matches the standard definitions of psychopathy, and realize that such a condition negates responsibility. I will not ask here whether or by how many people that space is occupied – although it would be surprising if it was empty. Nor will I tackle the difficult issues that we face in trying to decide which individuals fall within that space: whether particular people are non-responsible, or only disturbingly different, or morally reprehensible. My concern is with the prior question of whether there is such a space, and how it should be defined.Before tackling that question directly, however, I must say a little about responsibility, as I will be using the notion here.",

      "title": "A Study of Impact of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) on Adjustment of Senior Secondary Students",
      "abstract": "Various problems of the society and an individual can be sorted out through adjustment. It has been realised that major obstacles in the progress of the nation is adjustment problems of its young generation. It is our responsibility to buildup the confidence level of the students so that they can utilise their talent, capabilities and potentialities for constructive work. Proper adjustment makes way for effective adaptation. Adjustment means training of thoughts and behaviour pattern that yield satisfaction today and prepare a person to solve their future problems. A well adjusted person has the ability to perform his/her duties well. Maladjustment brings social deterioration and thus society does not tolerate maladjusted persons.In the present scientific era, people are facing a lot of complexities in their lives. A person makes a lot of adjustments and strives hard to cope up with stress and anxiety. Adjustment is relative and not absolute term. It refers to the adequacy of the person and interpersonal process that can be used to adapt to our environment. A well adjusted person is flexible, change according to environment and behaves according to the culture and given situation. The dictionary meaning of the adjustment, is to make suitable, adapt, arrange, modify, harmonise or make correspondence, Chaplin in his Dictionary of psychology (1968) has defined adjustment as:* Variation of the activities of the organism in order to surmount a barrier and satisfy needs.* Establishment of a harmonious relationship with the physical and social environment.Golelman (1969) defined adjustment as the outcome of the individual's efforts to deal with stress and meet his needs. Eysenck (1972) states adjustment is a state in which needs of the individual on one hand are fully satisfied or the process by which this harmonious relationship can be attained. Singh (1983) pointed out that adjustment is a precarious and ever changing balance between the needs and desires of the individuals on one hand and the demands of environment and society on the other hand. Srivastava (1996) stated that adjustment is the harmonious relations with the environment in which most of the individual's needs are satisfied in socially acceptable way and resulting in forms of behaviour which may range from passive conformity to rigorous actions. Parmeshwaran and Beena (2004) stated that adjustment is a process by which a living organism acquires a particular way of acting or behaving or changes an existing form of behaviour or action. This adjustment is of twotype, viz., adjustment to external conditions and adjustment to internal conditions. A balance between these two adjustments becomes necessary as a person grows older.Thus adjustment is* That process that maintain balance between physical, psychological and social needs.* A continuous process that keep harmonious relationship between a human being and his environment.* That process which directs towards modifications of behaviour and attitudes.* That state of condition that promotes happiness and efficiency of the person and* That implies proper degree of social feeling and acceptance of social responsibility.Components of adjustmentAdjustment is basically composed oftwo components* Personal Components: These consists of a person's own physical and mental health, work efficiency, sense of satisfaction, self understanding, self-respect, intellectual development, emotional maturity, interests and compatible goals.* Environmental Components: These consists of parents' attitude, social acceptance, economic factors, physical conditions in the environment, expectations of family and teacher's rating etc.Bell (1958) has taken five areas in his adjustment inventory namely home, health, social, emotional and occupational.Some of the well known adjustment areas are given below Emotional Adjustment: Emotions are feelings that may be good or bad towards something. …",

      "title": "Creativity Enhancement: A Primer",
      "abstract": "Abstract Creativity is a complex high-order cognitive capacity, involving multiple cognitive processes interacting together in complex dynamics. It holds significant value at both the individual and societal levels, serving as a driving force for innovation and development. Given its significance, can creativity be enhanced? And if so, in which ways and which cognitive and neural mechanisms are impacted by such creativity enhancement? Creativity enhancement seeks to unlock and cultivate individuals’ creative potential through a variety of methods. This involves training on various aspects, such as associative thinking, cognitive flexibility, and problem-solving strategies, as well as various manipulations, such as priming, meditation, improvision, and brain stimulation, with the aim of fostering more creative thinking. Training programs incorporate various practice sessions to facilitate the transfer of acquired creativity-related skills, while manipulation techniques focus on altering momentary cognitive states to enhance or activate a creative mindset. This chapter provides a general overview of the effective methods and potential challenges of creativity enhancement. Future developments may include conducting more in-depth research into the neural mechanisms of creativity, integrating creativity more broadly into education systems, and leveraging technological innovations to provide more personalized and effective enhancement tools.",

      "abstract": "PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF SELF-CONTROL BY FARIHA RAHMAN THE ROLE OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE C onsider the constant cognitive work you, and most of the people you know, undertake everyday: scheduling every hour, changing behavioral modes and goals between various involvements, and ma- neuvering through many different social worlds. All of these tasks require a few key skills. One must be able to redirect one's focus, track useful information, and avoid distractions. In other words, much of our everyday functioning, as well as the occa- sional extraordinary successes, depends on our capacity to correctly analyze new situ- ations and respond in a controlled manner. These abilities are encompassed by the broad term “executive function” (EF), which refers to working memo- ry, planning, and cognitive flexibility. 1 Although these are rather complex cog- nitive skills, they are fundamental to living with purpose, and their dysfunc- tion is nothing short of disastrous for the average cognitively healthy adult. Consequently, executive function is of- ten tracked in cases of neuropsychologi- cal disorders. Common tests of executive function challenge the subject to change focus, adjust habitual physical motor re- sponses, correctly respond to conflict- ing experiences or directions (interfer- ence tasks), and focus on long term goals. One interference task, which takes several forms, is called “set-shifting. Set-shifting requires the subject to switch a goal, and the corresponding set of behavioral responses, in the middle of a task. As this goes against the subject’s previous habits, successful completion of the task demands flexible thinking. More specifically, set-shifting tasks force the subject to choose one cor- rect response when presented with cues that would elicit different responses if they appeared separately, thus producing an in- terference condition. Set-shifting tasks ex- ist for a surprising number of different ani- mals, including humans, rats, and monkeys. THE ROLE OF THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX How is it that monkeys can ever successful- ly complete tests of executive function? The answer lies in brain structure. In primate, and especially human, evolution, the devel- opment of one area of the brain particular- ly stands out: the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC refers to the furthest forward, or “anterior, part of the frontal cortex, lo- cated below our foreheads. As we look at various members of the animal kingdom, the complexity of an animal's PFC is in- versely related to its evolutionary distance from Homo sapiens. That is, the human PFC is more complex than that of other primates - denser with neurons and their interconnections - while the primate PFC is, in turn, more complex than that of other non-human mammals. Meanwhile, mam- mals are the largest category of animals that have any PFC whatsoever - although some other animals have analogous, but simpler, brain structures.

      "abstract": "CHAPTER II of this issue of the REVIEW gives the characteristics of children as one of the main influences on the curriculum. The present chapter develops further one area of children's characteristics and draws from them some implications for school programs. It emphasizes the intellectual activities of preschool and school children, not as isolated behavior but as functioning intelligence and a part of total behavior in different situations involving thinking. Research studies on children's thinking as such are relatively meager. Mental tests are concerned with products rather than the process. Most psychological studies of perception, concept formation, and creative thinking have used college students or adults as subjects. There are at least three reasons for this neglect of direct study of children's thinking: (a) The term thinking as frequently used is an omnibus term. We say a child may be thinking as he cries for his cereal, urges his peers to build with blocks, or writes a paragraph for a school report. Because the term is diffuse, it has been difficult to study in an organized way. (b) Thinking, like other psychological processes, can be studied only indirectly by observing behavior, recording language, or keeping laboratory records (33). A child's language and thinking are closely related but not identical (36). All we can know about thinking must be a product of inductive inference. (c) No well-rounded theory of children's thinking has been presented as a guide to experimental work. The many accounts of thinking in books on logic, including Dewey's famous statement (19), are idealized pictures rather than factual accounts of what happens in children's everyday thinking. The logician states errors in thinking, for example, but gives us no data on their frequency. Recent psychological accounts of thinking, such as those of Humphrey (36), Johnson (39, 40), Leeper (45), Symonds (63), and Vinacke (71), give small place to genetic aspects of thinking.",

Evidence is reviewed showing that clients suffering various neurotic disorders tend to negatively distort feedback about others' reactions and their own performance in such a way as to bolster negative self-evaluation, and that this in turn inhibits and in other ways interferes with social performance. These negative self-evaluations may also interfere with training objectives, particularly durability and generalisation of new skills. Ways of changing self-beliefs are suggested, and various aspects of cognitive therapy and rational-emotive therapy are recommended as solutions to these problems.",

Parental upbringing, continuous failure, depression and internal self-critic are factors that influence the development of oneâ€™s self-concept. A positive self-concept can be developed through behave objectively in knowing oneself, always appreciate oneself, be friend to oneself and always have a positive and rational thinking. Educational psychology can be referred to a distinct scientific discipline within psychology that includes both method of study and a resulting knowledge base. It is believed that the development of studentâ€™s self-concept depends on the focus of educators in educational psychology in classroom practice. Educational psychology provides important background knowledge that pre-service and in-service educators can use as the foundation for professional practice. A positive self-concept can contribute to good academic achievement by studentâ€™s optimistic personal expectations about himself or herself.",

      "title": "Cognitive and metacognitive, motivational, and resource considerations for learning new skills across the lifespan",
      "abstract": "Abstract Across the lifespan, learners have to tackle the challenges of learning new skills. These skills can range from abilities needed for survival, such as learning languages, learning to walk during infancy, and learning new software for a job in adulthood, to abilities related to leisure and hobbies. As the learner progresses through novice to expert stages, there are cognitive and metacognitive, motivational, and resource considerations for learning new skills. In terms of cognitive considerations, fluid and crystallized abilities as well as executive functions interact to help the learner process and retain information related to the skills. In terms of metacognitive considerations, knowing what to learn and how to learn are important for novel skill learning. In terms of motivational considerations, changes in individuals' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation throughout the lifespan impact their pursuit of novel skill learning, and declines in motivation can be buffered through the cultivation of grit, growth mindset, self‐efficacy, and other personal factors. In terms of resource considerations, there are many tools that learners can use to acquire new skills, but allocation and availability of these resources differ based on life stage and socioeconomic status. Taken together, these considerations may provide learners with the best chance at acquiring new skills across the lifespan. Further research investigating these three factors, particularly among older adult learners, and their interactive effects could help increase our understanding of their impacts on skill learning and inform future cognitive interventions that can be tailored to learners' unique needs.

      "title": "Digital Technologies for Innovative Mental Health Rehabilitation",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness, characterized by the loss of the notion of reality, failing to distinguish it from the imaginary. It affects the patient in life’s major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, and the usual treatment is performed with the help of anti-psychotic medication, which targets primarily the hallucinations, delirium, etc. Other symptoms, such as the decreased emotional expression or avolition, require a multidisciplinary approach, including psychopharmacology, cognitive training, and many forms of therapy. In this context, this paper addresses the use of digital technologies to design and develop innovative rehabilitation techniques, particularly focusing on mental health rehabilitation, and contributing for the promotion of well-being and health from a holistic perspective. In this context, serious games and virtual reality allows for creation of immersive environments that contribute to a more effective and lasting recovery, with improvements in terms of quality of life. The use of machine learning techniques will allow the real-time analysis of the data collected during the execution of the rehabilitation procedures, as well as enable their dynamic and automatic adaptation according to the profile and performance of the patients, by increasing or reducing the exercises’ difficulty. It relies on the acquisition of biometric and physiological signals, such as voice, heart rate, and game performance, to estimate the stress level, thus adapting the difficulty of the experience to the skills of the patient. The system described in this paper is currently in development, in collaboration with a health unit, and is an engineering effort that combines hardware and software to develop a rehabilitation tool for schizophrenic patients. A clinical trial is also planned for assessing the effectiveness of the system among negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The article presents the results of a quantitative study of the relationship between the phenomenon of procrastination and the level of emotional intelligence of students. Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to recognize, understand and manage one's own and others' emotions. In modern psychology and other fields, emotional intelligence has entered the list of most needed competencies. As for the concept of procrastination, it is considered as factor that stimulates the process of self-determination in the personal, social, everyday life and professional spheres of a modern person. Translated from the English, the word \"procrastination\" means \"postponing\". According to several foreign studies, this phenomenon includes emotional, behavioral and motivational components. In addition, procrastination increases the level of anxiety and stress in a person, as the result person engages in unnecessary stress-reducing activities instead of completing meaningful tasks. Unpleasant feelings and frustration arises, because the person realizes that it is impossible to satisfy many needs, in addition, perfectionism begins to arise in such individuals. Nowadays, academic procrastination has reached a high level among modern students. Due to factors such as the increase in information, the increase in the number of technical gadgets, social networks take up a lot of time, the correct use of time has become difficult for many students. Emotional intelligence, due to the correct understanding of one's own emotional state and emotions, allows to prevent stress and turn to personal effectiveness. Emotional intelligence is based on personality traits such as self-awareness, self-control and motivation. As a result of the study, it was found that perfectionism allows you to understand and manage emotions, and also helps to establish quality relationships with other people. Keywords: emotional intelligence, procrastination, personality traits, motivation, selforganization.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive regulation refers to the self-directed regulation of cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, affects) toward the attainment of goals. Cognitive regulation can occur before individuals engage in tasks, while they are working on them, and during pauses or when tasks are completed where individuals reflect on their performances. Researchers have addressed which cognitive regulation processes are used during various phases of task engagement, how these processes differ among individuals due to ability and achievement levels and due to development, how cognitive regulation processes operate during task engagement, and which interventions can effectively help persons become better cognitive regulators. The implications of the research findings are that teachers and others can help learners improve their cognitive regulation skills. Some important processes are goal setting, strategy use and adaptation, monitoring of cognition and performance, motivation (e.g., self-efficacy), and self-evaluation. Effective interventions expose students to models displaying these skills and provide for practice with feedback. There are six limitations of the present research that should be addressed. This can be accomplished by conducting more intervention studies, examining fine-grained changes in cognitive regulation, conducting research in non-traditional contexts, integrating the educational and developmental literatures, exploring cognitive regulation across cultures, and investigating cognitive regulation during learning with technology.",

      "abstract": "En mas de una ocasion nos habremos preguntado por que algunas personas, independientemente de su cultura, o historia personal, reaccionan frente a problemas de manera inteligente, creativa y conciliadora, por que algunas personas tienen mas desarrollada que otras la habilidad para relacionarse bien con los demas, aunque no sean las que mas se destacan por su inteligencia, por que algunos triunfan aunque no sean los mas inteligentes.\r\nInicialmente la respuesta fue, que algunos individuos tenian un coeficiente de inteligencia superior al de los demas. Hoy sabemos que el nuevo concepto que da respuesta a este y otros interrogantes es la inteligencia emocional, una destreza que nos permite conocer y manejar nuestros propios sentimientos, interpretar o enfrentar los sentimientos de los demas, sentirnos satisfechos y ser eficaces en la vida, a la vez que crear habitos mentales que favorezcan nuestra propia productividad.\r\nNo existen formulas sencillas, ni practicas para trabajar con las personas debido a que cada una posee una carga emocional y viviencias diferentes.\r\nTampoco existe una solucion ideal unica para los problemas de las organizaciones, todo lo que se puede hacer es incrementar la comprension y las capacidades existentes para elevar el nivel de las relaciones humanas en el trabajo; esto comenzando por conocer a los miembros de trabajo ya que no podemos olvidar que el interes que les brindemos produce resultados favorables para la organizacion, un aspecto tambien fundamental es definir los roles con claridad pues solo asi podremos darnos cuenta si vamos cumpliendo objetivos y metas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Significant debate on fundamental issues remains in the subfields of cognitive science, including perception, memory, attention, action selection, learning, and others. Psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence each contribute alternative and sometimes conflicting perspectives on the supervening problem of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current efforts toward a broad-based, systems-level model of minds cannot await theoretical convergence in each of the relevant subfields. Such work therefore requires the formulation of tentative hypotheses, based on current knowledge, that serve to connect cognitive functions into a theoretical framework for the study of the mind. We term such hypotheses “conceptual commitments” and describe the hypotheses underlying one such model, the Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent (LIDA) Model. Our intention is to initiate a discussion among AGI researchers about which conceptual commitments are essential, or particularly useful, toward creating AGI agents.",

      "abstract": "The article describes the applied problems of preserving the psychological health of an individual. The structure of emotional well-being is revealed as one of the important criteria of psychological health. The parameters that determine the emotional well-being of a healthy individual and are risk factors for his psychological health are highlighted: internality in the field of family relations, which means responsibility for events in family life; contact, which means the ability to establish deep relationships with others; subjective well-being, which means a reluctance to complain of discomfort; creativity, which means high creative orientation in professional activity; self-acceptance, which means the ability to accept oneself with flaws and weaknesses; behavioral flexibility as the ability to quickly respond to a changing situation; the morality index as the state of the moral sphere; personality maturity as responsibility and self-respect. It is emphasized that these factors can contribute to a decrease in the level of psychological health, which is manifested in the form of the inability to establish deep relationships with others, the tendency to complain of discomfort, a decrease in the ability to quickly respond to a changing situation, indifference to significant events in professional life and many other social psychological phenomena. Key words: personality, psychological health, emotional well-being, rehabilitation, extreme stress factors.",

I discuss whether theory of mind, i.e. the ability to attribute mental states to others to predict and explain their behaviour, fits these two principles. In agreement with available evidence, embodied cognitive processes may underlie the earliest manifestations of social cognitive abilities such as infants’ selective behaviour in spontaneous-response false belief tasks. Instead, late theory-of-mind abilities, such as the capacity to pass the (elicited-response) false belief test at age four, depend on children’s ability to explain people’s reasons to act in conversation with adults. Accordingly, rather than embodied, late theory-of-mind abilities are embedded in an external linguistic practice.",

      "abstract": "ResumenLa definición de las competencias sociales y emocionales no ha sido tarea fácil para los psicólogos. Existen varios criterios e indicios que permiten evaluar en qué medida los niños y los adultos se comportan de forma competente. No obstante, la educación formal recibida para alcanzar dichas competencias es, por lo general, muy escasa o nula. Los resultados de los programas clásicos basados en el aprendizaje de técnicas específicas indican que se produce muy poca generalización a contextos naturales y que la duración de los efectos de mejora es muy corta. Existen, sin embargo, otro tipo de intervenciones que apoyándose en la filosofía e incitando a los niños a reflexionar deforma crítica, proporcionan una formación más profunda y resultados más duraderos. Nuestra propuesta defiende un currículo centrado en la mejora de estas competencias durante el segundo ciclo de Educación Infantil (3–6 años) trabajando desde un enfoque basado en el programa Filosofía para Niños pero que también ofrezca la posibilidad de aprender pautas concretas de conducta, cognitivas y de relación con los demás.AbstractDefining social and emotional competence has not been easy for psychologist. Multiple criteria can be used to evaluate to what extent children and adults behave competently. Formal education is not devoted to teaching children such competences. In general, efforts are very poor or completely absent from the school curriculum. The results of classic intervention programmes based on learning specific techniques show that generalisation to natural contexts is limited, and that duration of positive effects over time is very short. There are, nevertheless, other kinds of interventions based on philosophy that by inviting children to think in a critical way, promote deep and long lasting effects. Our proposal defends a school curriculum focused on the improvement of these competences between 3 and 6 years of age. We suggest programmes based on Philosophy for Children, but offering also concrete behavioural, cognitive and interaction patterns.Palabras clave: Competencia socialcompetencia emocionalculturaprogramas de intervenciónFilosofía para NiñosKeywords: Social competenceemotional competencecultureintervention programmesPhilosophy for Children",

      "title": "Borderline Academic: Precarious Work, Life, and Self",
      "abstract": "Abstract Casual work is frequently the only option for early career researchers and aspiring academics, but it is steeped in precarity. Such uncertainty in one’s professional sphere inevitably affects stability in other areas, from financial planning to making social commitments, potentially rendering not just one’s career but one’s life precarious. The features of a precarious life are the same features that, when embodied, designate a person as mentally ill: unpredictability, instability, susceptibility to sudden change, existence in a liminal space. Those (professionally or otherwise) diagnosed with a mental illness find themselves perpetually on the border between ill and well, acceptable and unacceptable, subject to and excluded from institutional systems. Nowhere is this paradoxical dynamic more evident than in the nomenclature of the condition borderline personality disorder: the label evokes a state of flux (borderline) that is all-encompassing (affecting the whole personality) and which produces chaos (disorder). Drawing on my experience as both a casually employed academic and a person with borderline personality disorder, this article reflects on the imposition of precarity onto my professional (and, therefore, financial and social) existence. Without promoting the casualization of work, this think-piece also considers the creative possibilities inherent in uncertainty and the generative potential of being ‘on the border’.",

Mental Health can be concisely defined as the state of equilibrium that can be felt within the individual and observed between the individual and others. It has very high impact on the student's academic growth, personal development as well as the maturation of his/her sentiments. Hence the monitoring of mental health in students life frequently and evaluating it on the basis of concrete scientific theory is important. Along with that such evaluation should further require the proper and timely medical treatment. Psychological evaluation of student's mental health can be based on various psychic factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, GDA etc which can be caused due to pressure of society on child, unrealistic expectation of parents from child and academic pressure. Psychological Evaluation of students mind can be done using these factors which can give complete insights of mental state of the child which can be further used to detect the deterioration of mental health. Predictive analytics can help to identify such situation hence be able to nurture the mental healthcare by taking appropriate measures",

      "title": "Exploratory Appraisal of Metacognitive Skilfulness and Academic Performance of Rural Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Metacognition refers to learners' automatic awareness of their own knowledge and their ability to understand, control, and manipulate their own cognitive processes. Metacognitive skills are important not only in school, but throughout Ufe.Metacognitive-like processes are especially ubiquitous when it comes to the discussion of self-regulated learning. Being engaged in metacognition is a salient feature of good self-regulated learners. Groups reinforcing collective discussion of metacognition are a salient feature f self-critical and self-regulating social groups. The activities of strategy selection and application include those concerned with an ongoing attempt to plan, check, monitor, select, revise, evaluate etc.Metacognition is 'stable' in that learners' initial decisions derive from the pertinent fact about their cognition through years of learning experience. Simultaneously, it is also 'situated' in the sense that it depends on learners' familiarity with the task, motivation, emotion, and so forth. Individuals need to regulate their thoughts about the strategy they are using and adjust it based on the situation to which the strategy is being applied. At a professional level, this has led to emphasis on the development of reflective practice, particularly in the education and health-care professions.Metacognition helps people to perform many cognitive tasks more effectively. Strategies for promoting metacognition include self-questioning (e.g. What do I already know about this topic? How have I solved problems like this before?), thinking aloud while performing a task, and making graphic representations (e.g. concept maps, flow charts, semantic webs) of one's thoughts and knowledge. Carr (2002) argues that the physical act of writing plays a large part in the development of metacognitive skills. (Gammil, 2006)Metacognitive abilities begin to develop around the age of 5 to 7 years and improve throughout school (Flavell et al., 1995; Gamer 1990). Perry et al. (2000) while working with 1st and 2nd graders found that asking students two questions helped them become more metacognitive. The questions were What did you learn about yourself as a reader/writer today? and What did you that you can do again and again and again? When teachers asked these questions regularly during class, even young students demonstrated fairly sophisticated levels of metacognitive understanding and action. On the contrary, Annevirta and Vauras (2006) examined the development of meta-cognitive skill in elementary school children. The results divulged that children with initially high metacognitive level had better metacognitive skill in problem-solving tasks during first two school years, whereas the self-guided behaviour of children with lower metacognitive knowledge resembled more the type of adult-dependent behaviour typical of young children as late as the second grade. So, there was no clear developmental relationship between metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive skills.Strategy Evaluation Matrices (SEM) can help to improve the knowledge of cognition component of metacogntion. The SEM works by identifying the declarative, procedural and conditional knowledge about specific strategies. The SEM can help individuals identify the strength and weaknesses about certain strategies as well as introduce them to new strategies that they can add to their repertoire.Objectives of the study* To examine the metacognitive profile of rural adolescents.* To assess the academic performance of rural adolescents.Locale of the studyThe study was conducted in Ludhiana City of Punjab state.MethodParticipantsThe sample for the present study comprised of randomly selected 240 rural adolescents studying in grade 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th from Ludhiana District.InstrumentsThe following standardized tools were used to collect the relevant data for the study.Personal Information Sheet was used to assess the socio-personal profile of the adolescents, viz. …",

      "abstract": "AbstractDementia is the progressive decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the body beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It is a non-specific illness syndrome in which affected areas of cognition may be memory, attention, language, and problem solving. Higher mental functions are affected first in the process. Especially in the later stages of the condition, affected persons may be disoriented in time (not knowing what day of the week, day of the month, month, or even what year it is), in place (not knowing where they are), and in person (not knowing who they are or others around them). This paper reported the use of a technique involving a game that focuses on two cognitive functions - memory and problem solving. The 'game' was developed by first experimenting with a few essential perceptual factors such as vision and hearing in the elderly with dementia. On the basis of the observation, we came up with two games (i.e., memory and problem solving) that were later used in training to improve cognitive functions of the elderly with dementia. After three sessions of training that ran across two months we compared the reaction times and scores of the participants from the two games. The results suggest an improvement in the memory as well as problem solving abilities of the elderly. These experimental results are hoped to contribute as a method in the rehabilitation of the elderly with dementia.",

      "abstract": "El presente artículo de revisión bibliográfica investiga la relación entre los conceptos de regulación emocional y control inhibitorio destacando sus funciones y diferencias. A su vez, se mencionan sus características principales en la etapa preescolar. Se ha realizado una revisión exhaustiva y minuciosa sobre el tema en las principales fuentes de información y se ha llegado a la conclusión de que son constructos diferentes pero a su vez interdependientes. Mantienen una relación estrecha y recíproca compartiendo importantes puntos de desarrollo en común. El control inhibitorio es una de las principales funciones ejecutivas, junto con la memoria de trabajo y la flexibilidad cognitiva, y todas ellas se encuentran en la base de cualquier conducta organizada. Por otro lado, permiten el desarrollo de otras funciones más complejas como pueden ser el razonamiento, la planificación o la capacidad para resolver problemas. Estas habilidades de alto nivel cognitivo se desarrollan y evolucionan a lo largo de la vida manifestando un importante desarrollo en la etapa preescolar. Resultan imprescindibles para lograr una adaptación exitosa al ambiente, mantener una salud integral y están directamente vinculadas a la adquisición y desarrollo de las habilidades socioemocionales. En la infancia, tanto el control inhibitorio como la regulación emocional resultan fundamentales para obtener éxito académico y responder adecuadamente a las exigencias del entorno. El primero permite regular la atención, la cognición y el comportamiento mientras que la regulación emocional posibilita que las personas aprendan a regular la intensidad y la expresión de sus emociones. Ambos constructos están fuertemente vinculados con el desarrollo de competencias socioemocionales que promoverán interacciones sociales positivas y significativas. El control inhibitorio se encuentra en la base del proceso regulatorio de emociones y ambas habilidades tienen un importante desarrollo durante la etapa preescolar. Se pueden entrenar y, por lo tanto, se deben contemplar en las propuestas educativas.",

      "title": "Self-Regulation, Co-Regulation, and Shared Regulation in Collaborative Learning Environments",
      "abstract": "Early socio-cognitive conceptions of self-regulated learning (SRL) emphasized individual, cognitive-constructive aspects involved in cognition, behavior, and motivation, as well as social context as a component in the triadic process of self-regulation. In this chapter, there are three primary modes of regulation in collaborative learning: self-regulated learning, [socially] shared regulation of learning, and co-regulated learning. The following revisions to those constructs more adequately address conceptual and empirical challenges emerging in the past few years. SRL became a cornerstone for exploring more social forms of regulation such as co-regulation and shared regulation. Co-regulation occurs when affordances or constraints are appropriated by individuals (self-regulation) or groups (shared regulation) to fundamentally provoke strategic monitoring, evaluating, or adapting of motivational, behavioral, cognitive, and/or affective products within and across phases of regulation. Shared regulation can be successfully promoted by scripting planning and reflection to: increase awareness of learning processes, externalize learning processes in a social plane, and activate key regulation processes.",

      "title": "Textbook of Evolutionary Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine are concerned with medical conditions affecting the brain, mind, and behaviour in manifold ways. Traditional approaches have focused on a restricted array of potential causes of psychiatric and psychosomatic conditions, including adverse experiences such as trauma, neglect, or abuse, genetic vulnerability, and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. While essential for the understanding of mental disorders, these approaches have disregarded pertinent questions such as why the human mind is vulnerable to dysfunction at all. This Textbook of Evolutionary Psychiatry and Psychosomatic Medicine seeks to find answers to these questions by emphasizing an evolutionary perspective on psychiatric and psychosomatic conditions. It explains how the human brain/mind has been shaped by natural and sexual selection; why adaptations to environmental conditions in our evolutionary past may nowadays work in suboptimal ways; and how human cognition, emotions, and behaviour can be scientifically framed to improve our understanding of how people try to attain important biosocial goals pertaining to one’s status in society, mating, eliciting and providing care, and maintaining rewarding relationships. The evolutionary topics relevant to the understanding of psychiatric and psychosomatic conditions include the concepts of genetic plasticity, life-history theory, stress regulation, and immunological aspects. In addition, it is argued that an evolutionary framework is necessary to understand how psychotherapy and psychopharmacology work to improve the lives of patients with psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders.",

      "title": "Conducting Multilevel Intervention Research: Leveraging and Looking Beyond Methodological Advances",
      "abstract": "Much human behavior is guided by the seemingly reasonable intuition that “more is better,” perhaps deriving from evolutionary demands to fulfill basic needs for food, water, shelter, and safety. Such an intuition undergirds many educational, medical, and industrial advances over the past century. One can see this intuition when designers move from single impoverished solutions to more complex approaches. To what extent is the intuition accurate? It appears so in some domains; for example, recent evidence suggests that “multidisciplinary” research teams can, at least under some circumstances, produce more generative science than can individual investigators (1).\r\n\r\nIs it the case that more is better when designing health interventions? That is the question posed by the articles appearing in this supplement, with a particular focus on more levels of influence. The guiding intuition is that well-meaning practitioners and researchers are often myopic in their attempts to change health outcomes because they do not acknowledge the rich social, organizational, policy, and structural environment within which such outcomes occur. Indeed, traditional theories of health behavior change focus almost exclusively on intrapersonal processes such as self-efficacy and attitudes without sufficient attention to environmental variables that explain appreciable variance in human behavior. This state of affairs highlights the need for multilevel interventions as described herein.\r\n\r\nMultilevel interventions are expensive in every currency, including time, financial burden, and human capital, however, so it is particularly important to build a scientific foundation justifying their development and implementation. Fortunately, the articles in this monograph offer an optimistic chorus. In addition to providing convincing evidence for the merit of adopting multilevel interventions, these articles offer a wide variety of practical tools to facilitate the kind of rigorous science that is required. Relatively new statistical techniques such as hierarchical linear models, Cox proportional hazard models, and latent curve modeling along with computer simulations building on deterministic, stochastic, and Bayesian models (2) hold tremendous promise as analytic tools that can be applied in multilevel interventions. The opportunity to test for mediated moderation and moderated mediation (3) allows investigators to understand not only what interventions work but when and why they work—key elements to maximizing reach and sustainability.\r\n\r\nComplementing these tools is an array of unique methodological designs that boast the dual benefit of practicality and rigor. As Cleary et al. (4) remind us, the seminal volume on quasi-experimentation in field settings by Cook and Campbell (5) introduces many designs relevant to multilevel approaches such as interrupted time series designs and nonequivalent group designs. Collins et al. (6) have developed a primer on the use of fractional (rather than full factorial) experimental designs. These and other tools can address the need expressed throughout this supplement to move away from cross-sectional approaches and to embrace experimental and longitudinal designs. At the same time, these tools will need to be adapted to handle additional complexities such as nonlinear effects over time (7), randomization challenges (4), and the possibility that interventions at one level can unwittingly and perhaps serendipitously influence outcomes at other levels (or serve as necessary conditions for efforts at other levels to be effective, as Weiner et al. observe) (3). On a related note, the Behavioral Research Program at the National Cancer Institute—one of the sponsors of this monograph—has now acknowledged these and related needs by developing a new branch devoted to the actual science of doing behavioral research, with concomitant attention to research methods, scientific infrastructure, and emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nAs newer tools develop, and as more nuanced multilevel interventions emerge, one will need to be mindful of the panoply of human processes that inimitably influence behavior. As one example, Cialdini (8) observed that people were paradoxically more likely to remove artifacts from national parks when reading signs admonishing them not to do so. Why? The simple presence of those signs indicated to park visitors that other park visitors must be partaking of artifacts themselves, framing the behavior as normative and appropriate. One can just as easily imagine efforts at one level of health care undermining efforts at another because of how those efforts are construed by the recipients. Such complexities reinforce the exhortation by Alexander et al. (7) that successful multilevel approaches must be informed by careful and extensive qualitative research.\r\n\r\nThe development and testing of multilevel interventions will benefit from greater attention to two methodological issues. The first is a clearer articulation of what exactly constitutes a level in a multilevel approach; the boundaries distinguishing these levels may be more porous than desired. In Eastern cultures, “individual” processes are intricately woven into social identities making the line between individual and family more heuristic than real. Influences at the state level are intertwined with those at the federal and even global level, particularly given the Web-driven breakdown in geographical and institutional barriers to information. Cleary et al. (4) also remind us that groups and organizations at any given level of influence can themselves differ greatly. Moreover, the putative outcomes of multilevel interventions must be clearly defined and greatly expanded beyond outcomes at the individual level (9). The endurance and sustainability of multilevel interventions may hinge dramatically on the success of communication and dissemination, which in turn will be hindered by a lack of consensus on underlying definitional issues.\r\n\r\nSecond, multilevel interventions are likely to be more effective when they integrate theory from multiple disciplines and perspectives. Theories can help us predict, for example, when multilevel interventions are best construed as tests of accumulation, amplification, facilitation, cascading, or convergence [strategies identified by Weiner et al. (3)]. Users will need to face the limitation, of course, that most theories target outcomes at only one or two levels of analysis. One can view this state of affairs as an outstanding opportunity to improve theory and identify synergies across disparate theories. New tools are also available to measure the manner in which theory is used in field research settings (10), and these tools will themselves evolve when used in multilevel settings. Successful use of theory in multilevel interventions will help land this research area into “Pasteur’s Quadrant” (11)—one that can celebrate the ideal interplay between theory development and application and, by extension, the marriage of so-called basic and applied research. Theoretically driven approaches are better positioned to put our intuitions about human behavior to the test and weave lessons learned into interventions that advance public health in a desired direction.",

      "title": "Социально-психологические проявления личностной беспомощности на различных возрастных этапах",
      "abstract": "Personal helplessness is one of the factors, which interrupt the formation of innovative behaviour, while self-dependence boosts this process. Personal helplessness is an individual's system quality associated with a complex of symptoms of specific personal characteristics. Such characteristics develop as a result of the interaction of internal environment with outer environment (a system of family interrelations, experience of uncontrollable traumatic incidents) which in their turn result in the low level of subjectness the poor ability of a person to modify the reality, to manage the events in his/her own life and achieve his/her goals by overcoming difficulties. Personal helplessness reveals itself in the person's activity causing its low success. Communication is one of the types of activity in which personal helplessness manifests itself. Personal helplessness is located on one of the poles of the continuum, with the opposite pole being such a system quality of a person as self-dependence. Personal helplessness as a complex system characteristic specifically manifests itself in the sphere of person's relations including his/her relations with other persons of the same age. The results of the study prove the presence of several specific features in the system of relations of an individual with personal helplessness when a child, an adolescent and a juvenile. These specific features have been revealed by several indicators of the 16PF questionnaire by Cattell (factors A, F, H, E, Q2, G, N, L), Rosenzweig test, Q Methodology by William Stephenson and sociometric investigation. Personal helplessness manifests itself in the sphere of interpersonal relationships at all the studied age stages: an individual with personal helplessness does not only perceive the process of communication as less attractive, but also has fewer abilities for realization of his/her communication needs. Such person exhibits restraint in interpersonal contacts, has difficulties in direct and social communication and is introverted. Helpless individuals have less ability to develop good relationships with other people of the same age; they are less adapted to social environment; more often have a negative 222 sociometric status; are less satisfied with relationships and exhibit more dependency on a group. On the one hand, all these factors are found to be social and psychological manifestations of personal helplessness, while, on the other hand, they support the complex of symptoms of personal helplessness",

Self-oriented perfectionism was negatively related to total number of publications, number of first-authored publications, number of citations, and journal impact rating, even after controlling for competing predictors (e.g., conscientiousness). Self-oriented perfectionism may represent a form of counterproductive overstriving that limits research productivity amongst psychology professors.

Epistemic evaluations emerge in a great variety of contexts, from moments of deliberate private reflection on tough theoretical questions to casual social observations about what other people know and think. Extending the terminology of linguistics into epistemology, attitudes that can be held only to truths are called factive attitudes; some of these attitudes constitute states, where others constitute events or processes. Some judgments are careful, patient, and well considered; others are hasty and confused. Epistemologists' stock examples of justified beliefs include perceptual judgments in favorable circumstances, sound inferences, and responsible learning from testimony; stock examples of unjustified belief include wishful-thinking and hasty generalization. Agents exhibit epistemic vigilance in relation to the information transmitted to them.",

In addition, analytic thinking relates to having less traditional moral values, making less emotional or disgust-based moral judgments, and being less cooperative and more rationally self-interested in social dilemmas. Analytic thinkers are even less likely to offload thinking to smartphone technology and may be more creative. Taken together, these results indicate that the propensity to think analytically has major consequences for individual psychology.",

Key mechanisms of SAD occurrence and maintenance are specific biases in target regulation, as well as cognitive and perceptual selectivity biases of mental activity in personal evaluation situations. The sufferers experience such cognitive and perceptual selectivity bias as self-focused attention concerns (self-perception in a situation Me as viewed by others), selective monitoring of the stimuli which threaten their social status, as well as fixing on negative aspects of a situation, and negative prediction. SAD is characterized by metacognitive attributes to anxiety as dangerous and subjectively unacceptable event which displays are evaluated by others as a sign of incompetence or inconsistency, and form the basis for rejection. For sufferers to find themselves in an awkward situation, to be mocked and humiliated are the most significant fears in the situations of personal evaluation which are trigged without their objective analysis. For sufferers participation in the evaluation situations provokes excessive focus on minor operational and technical aspects of activity. SAD is characterized by shift of attention to performance and secondary aspects of self-presentation as related to target priority: shift of motive to target and shift of target to means (What's about my voice? Are my hands shivering? Someone has smiled; Everyone sees that I've blushed). Multitasking of cognitive and perceptual activity for SAD sufferers in the evaluation situations results into fast exhaustion of voluntary attention and disorders in implementation of activity, collapse of anxiety mediation and disorganization of behaviour. Account of the given mechanisms by SAD therapy leads to most effective and consistent therapeutic outcome.",

      "abstract": "Adaptability is usually conceived as a psychological capacity that sustains adaptive behaviors, allowing one to face, and manage stressors. It promotes adjustment between a person and its environment through a constant, dynamic, and dialectic interaction between them. Adaptability is conceptually and empirically distinct from dispositions such as personality or intelligence, but can be considered as a self-regulation process promoting an adequate person-environment fit (P-E fit), psychological health, and positive career-related outcomes, such as employability, employment, or work engagement. Adaptability evolves according to the circumstances and people can activate their adaptive abilities in adverse situations. Brief psychological interventions increase adaptability, which in turn improves employability and career success.",

Many authors believe that socio-emotional skills differ from traditional IQ measures or from raw intelligence. At the same time, they recognize that such skills interact with intelligence, which must be taken into consideration when measuring outcomes and estimating causal relationships. Some define socio-emotional competencies as skills that enable individuals to accomplish particular tasks, such as recognizing and managing their emotions, and coping successfully with conflict. Others contend that referring to such competencies as skills may implicitly exclude beliefs (for example, growth mindset), values (for example, prosocial motivation), and other rational attitudes (for example, trust). Commonly used terms include: soft skills, noncognitive skills, character skills, life skills, and 21st century skills.",

Six models—stimulus variation, organismic variation, multiple variation, interaction, stimulus mediation, and goal setting‐may be, in some cases, too simple and, in other cases, too complex to account for classroom learning. Perceptions of the social environment can make the models more parsimonious, serve as potent covariates, and account for additional variance in instructional research; they can also serve as interesting independent or dependent variables in social‐psychological inquiry. Several important generalizations can be made about social environments; and a number of research problems and priorities can be identified in the areas of theory, validity, evaluation, and educational goals.",

ETs work with many clients whose academic and social problems are directly or indirectly related to one or more executive function difficulties. The self-regulation tier is comprised of multiple executive functions responsible for cueing, directing, and coordinating moment-to-moment functioning within the domains of perception, emotion, cognition, and action. Self-regulation executive functions can be activated either non-consciously or through conscious effort. The chapter offers a comprehensive model of executive functions that offered a framework for discussing the role of executive functions in cueing and directing perceptions, emotions, cognitions, and actions within four arenas of involvement: intrapersonal, interpersonal, environment, and symbol system. It concludes with an overview of assessment methods for identifying executive function difficulties as well as an overview of approaches for helping clients deal with executive function difficulties.",

This paper outlines a possible model of such a process, in terms of two known principles of motivation: first, that willingness to undertake action is a function of some difference or ratio between expected result and the effort, whether physical or mental, required to attain it; and second that what is achieved is valued more highly if the effort required has been relatively great. These principles seem capable of tying together many seemingly disparate facts about age changes in learning and in adaptation to developments at work, and also in everyday interests and pursuits and in the acceptance of rehabilitative procedures. They also have implications for human relationships in old age. These are discussed with reference to loneliness, which is regarded as arising when personality characteristics make communications from and to other people unrewarding.",

      "title": "Insight and Judgment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insight and judgment are complex cognitive tasks that require the utilization and integration of several different mental functions, especially higher-level conceptual thinking. Prerequisites for insightfulness include the capacity for abstraction, ability to communicate (speech and language), intact cognitive function, absence of a thought disorder, euthymic mood, and stable affect (see Chapters 2 to 6). Even patients without disturbance of these functions may have poor insight as a result of using maladaptive psychologic defense mechanisms that distort the perception of internal and external realities or alter the motivation to relate openly with another person. In addition, the examiner needs to use his or her own abstract thinking in order to determine how insightful the patient is during the interview, because this determination is itself a subjective judgment. Evaluation of the patient’s insight and ability to make sound judgments is based on both the content and the process of the interview (see Chapter 1 ). In general, the more severely ill a psychiatric patient is, the more likely it is that his or her capacity for insight will be impaired. In order more fully to explore these constructs of insight and judgment, this chapter introduces the concepts of defense mechanisms and personality. These factors may adversely impact on decision making and insight, even in the setting of intact language and cognition. Although there are slightly different psycho-analytic views about defense mechanisms and their definitions, we have chosen to mostly rely on Vallaint’s (1977) descriptions. Even though specific personality styles or disorders are not documented in the MSE (but, rather, in the Assessment section of a written psychiatric evaluation because they represent diagnoses), predominant defense mechanisms should be described in the Insight and Judgment section of the MSE if they impact on the patient’s capacity for attaining adequate insight and judgment about his or her illness and life events.",

Intellectual virtues presuppose the objective of deep, factual perception with a possibility to make mistakes. A lot of pedagogues lack the activities important for virtues without dependence on mood or similar supporting means (the total level of virtue). A teacher who distinguishes with intellectual humility, who belongs to the virtues of the first range (the initiation of learning process and its guiding towards the right direction) and has connection with other intellectual virtues, aims for coordinated learning relationship where the sense of equality is present, as well as broaden perspective, distinguishes with flexibility while re-considering convictions, fear which is felt by an intellectually humble person when he/she misses information or something is not understood. An intellectually humble teacher, developing his/her knowledge, distinguishes with the constant pursuit for development, ability to self-evaluate strengths and weaknesses, seeing relationship with others as perspective for development The definition of intellectual humility is usually related with the recognition that your convictions and opinions can be wrong. This virtue is concerned with the strengths of a teacher. Being an intellectually humble person opens possibilities to the independence of a learner while forming or developing knowledge and understanding. In this process the potential of colleagues is recognized, strong and weak points are firmly pointed out, intellectual arrogance is avoided. This presupposes more possibilities for the change of learning both to a learner and the one dependant on him/her.",

Dalam skala yang lebih luas, AP bisa berdampak keputus-asaan, stress dan paranoid terhadap tanggung jawabnya sendiri. Hal itu bisa terjadi karena beberapa faktor. Beberapa penelitian mengenai faktor penyebab AP pada mahasiswa sangat bervariasi. Hal itu disebabkan berbedanya situasi yang melatarbelakangi keadaan pikologis dan sosial mahasiswa. Artinya, faktor penyebab AP pada satu instansi pendidikan tinggi akan berbeda dengan instansi pendidikan tinggi lainnya. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian diketahui bahwa indeks kelulusan mahasiswa yang lulus tepat waktu dibawah 50%. Pada faktor primer, AP bisa terjadi karena anxiety , time disorganization , poor task approach , stress and fatigue . Selain itu, faktor sekunder yang juga menjadi penyebab AP seperti low discomfort tolerance and pleasure seeking , self - depreciation , environmental disorganization dan lack of assertion .",

      "abstract": "The infant's participation in sequences of joint activity that require visual attention, or what is often called joint attention (e.g., gaze following, social referencing, pointing), is usually argued to be an outcome of and evidence for the existence of particular psychological competencies on the part of the infant. This convergence in opinion occurs, I contend, because social developmental theory is predicated in large part on a causal-psychological-representational picture of meaning and mind. In a review of the relevant literature I suggest that what is presupposed or at least underappreciated in most theories of joint attention is the role of social practice in the understanding of other minds. Rather than assuming that these joint activities requiring attention reveal psychological competencies, I argue that: (a) it is with recourse to such practices that researchers theorize about the infant's understanding of mind in the first instance, (b) the mind is not some entity that is separable from human activity, (c) knowledge of such practices is what the developing agent requires to come to an understanding of other minds, and (d) because non-language using agents do not understand mental states, young babies, a fortiori, do not understand their own attention or that of others. I then focus on a single infant activity typically thought to reveal a leg hold on other minds (i.e., pointing) and I report two empirical studies of its development. In the first I evaluate theories of the emergence of pointing by investigating the ways in which infants first get into shared activities involving pointing. In the second I investigate the development of pointing within mother-infant interaction. In neither study do I find support for the position that pointing gestures emerge as a result of some conceptual revolution on the part of the infant.",

      "abstract": "The article provides an overview of modern works devoted to the study of cognitive predictors of academic success. The general patterns of forecasting are revealed: the most powerful and universal predictor of academic success at different stages of school education is psychometric intelligence; creativity is less significant and rather unstable. It is argued that these patterns are poorly traced at the level of preschool education. Particular cognitive functions are significant for predicting the future educational achievements of preschoolers: information processing speed, visual perception (in combination with motor functions), short-term memory, and attention. Spatial abilities have a certain prognostic potential, though reasoning in preschoolers is not a strong predictor of academic success; executive functions have the greatest predictive power. It is noted that the general patterns in predicting the academic success of students can be traced in elementary school: the predictive potentials of psychometric intelligence are revealed, the power of individual cognitive abilities (in particular, spatial abilities) increases, the contribution of executive functions to the prediction decreases. The general tendency for non-cognitive factors (educational motivation, some personality traits) to increase with age also begins to appear in elementary school.",

In the words of John Hancock, ‘The greatest ability in business is to get along with others and influence their actions’. Similarly, it is significant to keep in touch with enhancing ‘Soft Skills’ cum ‘Life Skills’ in one’s life. The major form of Group Communication includes Leadership traits and Theories, Team working, Task building and Maintenance strategies, Problem Solving, Brainstorming Sessions, Decision Making and Stress Management Strategies.",

      "title": "From Brain to Being",
      "abstract": "Neurologists increasingly face clinical situations marked by diagnostic ambiguity, ethical complexity, and disorders that challenge traditional concepts of consciousness, personhood, and agency. Yet most neurology training programs remain focused on biomedical knowledge and procedural skills, offering limited preparation for these profound and often morally charged aspects of care. This educational gap may undermine clinical reasoning, ethical sensitivity, and the formation of a reflective professional identity. This review proposes the integration of 3 underrepresented but essential domains—epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind—into neurology education. Guided by Kern's 6-step curriculum development model, the article outlines theory-informed, evidence-based strategies to embed philosophical competencies within postgraduate training. Epistemology supports diagnostic reasoning through metacognitive insight, recognition of bias, and tolerance for ambiguity. Ethics education strengthens moral judgment and communication in scenarios involving capacity assessment, end-of-life care, and neurotechnological interventions. Philosophy of mind offers conceptual clarity for understanding disorders of consciousness, neurodegeneration, and altered personhood. Curricular strategies include narrative debriefings, ethics Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), interdisciplinary seminars, and reflective bedside teaching, all of which can be embedded into core clinical rotations such as neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) and cognitive neurology. Learning objectives are aligned with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education milestones and supported by validated assessment tools, including reflective writing rubrics, structured ethical evaluations, and measures of ambiguity tolerance. Implementation barriers—including faculty readiness and curricular constraints—are addressed through faculty development, co-teaching models, and modular integration. By reframing philosophy as a clinical competency rather than a theoretical enrichment, this review offers a pragmatic and forward-looking approach to neurology education. Embedding philosophical reasoning into training enhances diagnostic precision, ethical engagement, and patient-centered care. The integration of philosophy into neurology education is not a veneration of the past, but a forward-looking complement, offering a humanistic framework to guide clinical reasoning and professional identity in an era shaped by artificial intelligence and neurotechnology.",

      "abstract": "Interpersonal sensitivity means being able to display appropriate behaviors and to perceive others accurately.However, if it is not used at an optimum level, it can cause problems in interpersonal relationships.High interpersonal sensitivity leads to feelings of inadequacy and humiliation, feeling unimportant and worthless and mistreated by others.It also leads to selfdeprecation and over-monitoring of behaviors to reduce the risk of public rejection and criticism.When interpersonal sensitivity is very intense and makes the person become tender, it causes one to make mistakes when assessing and judging events and causes feelings of inadequacy in individuals.With increased interpersonal sensitivity, stereotyped thoughts are at the forefront.These thoughts lead to handicaps in performing roles and making decisions, difficulties in social relationships, disability in achieving goals, social withdrawal, and conflict.Becoming aware of cognitive distortions and stereotyped thoughts and displacing them with realistic ones can be helpful for keeping interpersonal sensitivity at an optimum level.Supporting selfesteem, focusing on individual successes, defining feasible goals, focusing on the strong personal characteristics, and providing effective use of social support systems are methods that can be used to decrease interpersonal sensitivity.",

Definitions of adaptive behavior emphasize the developmental nature of the construct and note that children's skills increase and become more complex as they grow older. The developmental relevance of adaptive skills is related to children's physical development and also to the demands and expectations that are encountered in new environments or situations. Definitions and measures of adaptive behavior typically include three major dimensions: conceptual skills, social skills, and practical skills. The construct of adaptive behavior is recognized as being dependent on the expectations of the social and cultural groups to which a person belongs. Children's adaptive behavior is very much influenced by the demands and expectations of the settings in which they are involved.",

Changes may be manifested in a change in orientation, in relative position, in the pattern of customary activities, attitude, behavior, or in character and in performance. Desires strongly enter into problems and can be colored by many factors including: age, sex, ethnic classification, culture, tradition, religion, economy, politics, and education. Desires and drives are of degree. Problems are essentially detriments to quality of service, or impedances to understanding. They are seen as defaults, defects, decay, accidents, discomfort, and inconvenience. Some problems may be discovered through the comparisons of situations or performance with accepted standards, norms, models, and patterns. Comparisons can give a measure of the problem and may provide a quantification for benefit-cost and cost-effectiveness analysis.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a basic drive of nature. Although many questions regarding the role of sleep remain unanswered, scientific studies have shown that sleep contributes significantly to several important cognitive, emotional and performance-related functions. Deprivation of sleep causes feelings of “sleepiness,” decreased levels of alertness or concentration. Excessive sleepiness is also associated with reduced short-term memory and learning ability, negative mood, inconsistent performance, poor productivity and loss of some forms of behavioural control. The consequences of insufficient sleep among adolescents are particularly important to understand because they appear to be closely tied to key elements of human development. Achieving developmental goals during adolescence is essential for lifelong success and social competency. In addition, the transition from childhood to adulthood is a critical time for “seeding” the values and habits that will shape their lives. Therefore, understanding sleep patterns of adolescents is important so that possible strategies for intervention can be formulated.",

In everyday life, these mental activities are usually considered to be rather different from each other – remembering meeting someone a month ago seems different from seeing the person in front of you – and this separation is often echoed in psychology textbooks, in which perception, memory, and decision-making are treated in different chapters. Much of the current thinking in cognitive psychology has reacted against this commonsense view, however, suggesting instead that these areas of study are better regarded as closely related and interacting aspects of one general processing system.",

These conceptions carry quantitative implications regarding the incidence rates of the phenomena they describe. To be scientifically useful, such definitions should have sufficient specificity and internal consistency. We analyzed four influential definitions of giftedness and assessed their internal consistency by computing the giftedness rate implied by each. Results reveal that the proportion of individuals who meet the standard of giftedness under some definitions is unrealistically high (e.g., &gt;75% in some conditions). The implication of this work is that the rigor and internal self-consistency of educational concepts requires improvement. The field must carefully consider the quantitative implications of its concepts, statements, and definitions.

Emotional intelligence as the ability to develop potential, empathize, cooperate, motivate and develop others cannot be separated from the system of effective activity and human resource management. The human personality is crucial in determining organizational leadership and success in terms of challenges and opportunities, as well as the passage of both international and bilateral relations. The main areas of emotional intelligence are: identifying emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions and managing emotions.The key components of emotional intelligence in the workplace are: self- awareness – the ability to understand one’s emotions, when making decisions, being aware of weaknesses and strengths, determining one’s goals and life values; self-regulation – the ability to manage emotions without succumbing to impulses; motivation – the ability to achieve one’s personal goals for increasing productivity – for the fact of achievement; empathy – the ability to understand the emotions of others, empathize with them and, despite this, make objective decisions; social skills – the ability to build strong relationships with your team. Nowadays there are no clear metrics for evaluating EQ yet, but there is a set of personality characteristics that helps determine the approximate level of the emotional indicator. The growing complexity of the business world requires great self-confidence, honesty, communication, conflict management and diversity to keep a global enterprise on the path to productivity and sustainability. It is emphasized that when managing a company, the relationship between employees and managers should have a mutual understanding of each other’s emotions, what they feel or think, what views on various topics they have, what strengths or weaknesses they possess, how they react, approach to work that motivates them and so on. It is emphasized that the understanding of the truth of emotional intelligence is still being studied in various fields, because its perception is individual.",

      "abstract": "The work environment can be considered one of the main determining factors that can influence the mental health of workers, especially as regards the structural and organisational conditions to which the worker is subjected. This work environment has positive effects when work provides satisfaction and contributes to personal self-fulfilment, or negative effects provoked by situations of stress, inadequate working patterns and schedules, possible situations of abuse and/or harassment, etc., which may contribute to the appearance of alterations in the mental health of the worker. Therefore, it is crucial that organisations use strategies for mental health promotion and disease prevention in the workplace, as mental health problems arising from work represent a major burden of disease for society and the economy of a country. Stress can be considered one of the main factors capable of disrupting a person's mental health and determining the development of a mental disorder, but other individual, socio-cultural, organisational, biological, and environmental factors also play a role to a greater or lesser extent. A negative work situation can trigger the development of serious mental disorders such as psychotic, neurotic, or cognitive disorders, as well as those derived from work-related stress and psychoactive substance abuse, and self-injurious behaviours. For early detection, treatment, reintegration, and/or rehabilitation, coordination between the public health system and occupational health or occupational risk prevention services is necessary.El entorno laboral puede ser considerado uno de los principales factores determinantes que puede influir en la salud mental de las personas trabajadoras, especialmente relacionados con las condiciones estructurales y organizativas a las que está sometida la persona trabajadora. Este entorno laboral proporciona efectos positivos cuando el trabajo aporta satisfacción y contribuye a la autorrealización personal, o negativos, por situaciones de estrés, por ritmos y horarios de trabajo inadecuados, por posibles situaciones de abuso y/o acoso, etc., pudiendo contribuir en la aparición de alteraciones en la salud mental de la persona trabajadora. A este respecto, es de vital importancia que las organizaciones recurran a estrategias de promoción de la salud mental y prevención de la enfermedad en los lugares de trabajo, de hecho, los problemas de salud mental derivados del trabajo representan una importante carga de enfermedad para la sociedad y la economía de un país. El estrés puede ser considerado uno de los factores capitales capaces de perturbar la salud mental de una persona, y determinar el desarrollo de un trastorno mental pero, existen otros factores individuales, factores socioculturales y organizativos, biológicos y ambientales que también influyen en mayor o en menor medida. Una situación laboral negativa puede desencadenar el desarrollo de trastornos mentales graves como pueden ser trastornos psicóticos, trastornos neuróticos, trastornos cognitivos, trastornos derivados del estrés laboral, trastornos por abuso de sustancias psicoactivas y trastornos autolíticos. Para su detección precoz, tratamiento, reinserción y/o rehabilitación se hace necesaria la coordinación entre el sistema de salud público y los servicios de salud laboral o de prevención de riesgos laborales.",

      "title": "To Study the Effect of Academic Achievement on the Level of Self Confidence",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONSelf-confidence is an attitude which allows individuals to have positive yet realistic views of themselves and their situations. Self-confident people trust their own abilities, have a general sense of control in their lives, and believe that, within reason, they will be able to do what they wish, plan, and expect. Having self-confidence does not mean that individuals will be able to do everything. Self-confident people have expectations that are realistic. Even when some of their expectations are not met, they continue to be positive and to accept themselves.Self-confidence is not necessarily a general characteristic which pervades all aspects of a person's life. Typically, individuals will have some areas of their lives where they feel quite confident, e.g., academics, athletics, while at the same time they do not feel at all confident in other areas, e.g., personal appearance, social relationships.Self confidence is a belief in yourself and your abilities, a mental attitude of trusting or relying on yourself. Confidence is sometimes equated with freedom from doubt; however when confidence is needed is usually when the outcome is uncertain, so that true confidence is actually about feeling comfortable with uncertainty and not knowing what the outcome will be.So it can conclude that Self-confidence is the expected probability that a person will achieve a goal in a certain situation. For example if mark estimates that his probability of achieving an on a calculus exam is 90%, we would conclude that mark had high self-confidence in his ability to do well on a calculus exam. If Mark had estimated 10%, then it would say that the person had low self-confidence about his ability to do well on the exam.REVIEW OF LITERATUREDuring the past decades various studies, researches works have been done on the academic achievement. Following is an epitome of these research works:Augustsson and Engstand (2001) examined of whether there are any long-term differences in academic achievements between children with and without observed or treated middle ear disease in a population with a stable long-standing treatment policy. A birth cohort of 2156 children was previously studied through a questionnaire to the parents at 4 years of age, follow-up after audiometric screening at 4, 7,11 and 14 years of age, and study of records from all Ear, Nose and Throats departments in the area; 2095 of these still lived in the area and received academic grades on leaving the ninth year of the state school system. We have compared these grades, and the choice of high school course for children with different experiences of otitis media. A history of treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media was correlated to minor group difference in the mean of grades, but not to any significant difference in the individual grades or in the choice of further studies. Having many episodes of acute otitis before the age of four was uncorrelated to lower grades and to less tendency to continue with theoretical studies. No harmful effect of middle ear disease could be shown in a large sample, suggesting that Swedish children do not suffer long-term effects on learning from otitis media.Hampton and Mason (2003) examined the impact of gender, learning disability (LD) status, and sources of efficacy on self-efficacy beliefs and academic achievement in the concept of Bandura's self-efficacy theory. Two hundred and seventy-eight high school students participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used. The results revealed that LD status had indirect influence on self-efficacy via the source variable; gender did not have direct or indirect influences on self-efficacy; sources of efficacy had direct impact on self-efficacy, which in turn affected academic performance. The structural model fit the data well and explained 55% of the variance in academic achievement.Rafferty, Shinn and Weitzman (2004) examined the school experiences and academic achievement of 46 adolescents in families who experienced homelessness and 87 permanently housed adolescents whose families received public assistance. …",

The review itself surveys methods for those particular data that reflect judgment of what education should accomplish. Evaluation requires judgment. Decision-making requires judgment. Both are judgmental in themselves but also depend on judgments previously made. A school and a curriculum are where they are because of judgments from within and from without. Judgments are made early, and late, and in between times. To understand what a school is doing requires an understanding of what a school is expected to do. In education, as elsewhere, judgments will continue to rest on incomplete knowledge, imprecise measurements, and inadequate experience. No error-free system is possible, but improvements are within easy reach. The evaluator may lessen the arbitrariness of judging and decision-making by introducing data-gathering methods already developed by other social scientists. Social psychologists, behavioral scientists, economists, political scientists, and historians routinely study opinions, preferences, and values. Many of their methods can be used to measure the judgments that shape an educational program.",

      "title": "The role of cognition in religious development : the contribution of relational and contextual reasoning (RCR)",
      "abstract": "In this work, The Role of Cognition in Religious Development is researched and discussed from various perspectives. Cognition here is defined as the activity of the mind, more specifically the act or process of knowing. This includes perceiving, appraising, understanding, reasoning, judging, remembering, imagining, planning, etc. Clearly, one's personal religiosity involves not just cognition, but also emotions, volition, unconscious drives, etc. However, more dimensions of social behaviour correlate with cognitive development than with any other aspect of personality. The development of cognition is an important ingredient also of religious / spiritual / faith development.\n\r\n \r\nExisting theories of religious / faith development by Fowler, Oser & Gmunder and others ascribing an important, albeit not an exclusive role to cognition are theoretically sound per se (and are empirically supported) as long as it is understood that they do not describe in detail individual development in the course of the life span but indicate developmental milestones many persons will reach along their religious journey (as far as it goes).\n\r\n\r\nWhile advocating in regard to religious development to take duly into account the important roles of religious rituals and experiences, emotions, meditation, the unconscious, social imbeddedness and other dimensions of religiosity, the case for the role of cognition seems robust enough to warrant a separate study.\n\r\n \r\nThe origin as well as the planning of this research project and the sequence of its stepwise execution are presented. After the author had familiarised himself with the scientific background from the perspective of religious studies and psychology of religion, a first theme evolved via the interpretation of a world view study with children and adolescents: While some participants fell victim to cognitive dissonance on account of divergences between a religious and a scientific world view, others managed to “co-ordinate” the two views to their satisfaction. \n\r\n\r\nThis co-ordinating capacity was diagnosed as an indication of a particular form of reasoning, eventually labelled Relational and Contextual Reasoning, RCR. Its systematic study was planned accordingly, and a series of empirical studies carried out (chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). This research showed that RCR ingredients are elements of (a) Piagetian operations, (b) cognitive complex thought, (c) dialectical thinking, (d) analogical thinking and it involves (e) a specific, trivalent logic as well as (f) advanced epistemic cognition (specifically an awareness of mental tools and their roles and importance for gaining dependable knowledge).\n\r\n\r\nAs the outcome of the theoretical and empirical studies of RCR demonstrated (chapters 2, 3, 4), RCR is particularly useful for understanding religious doctrines such as the Divine Creation of the universe, the Chalcedonian Definition of the two natures of Christ, and the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. \n\r\n\r\nLikewise, RCR furthers religious development on account of lessening the danger of cognitive dissonances, and supporting a second naivete (Ricoeur), as well as coordinating conceptual polar pairs such as the holy and the profane, divine providence and luck, freedom and dependence (chapters 4, 6)\n\r\n.\r\nBuilding on the results reported in chapters 2 to 6, the basics of a dynamic model of the Person-God Relationship were elaborated (chapter 7).",

      "abstract": "The ‘Executive Functions’ (EFs) of inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility enable us to think before we act, resist temptations or impulsive reactions, stay focused, reason, problem-solve, flexibly adjust to changed demands or priorities, and see things from new and different perspectives. These skills are critical for success in all life's aspects and are sometimes more predictive than even IQ or socioeconomic status. Understandably, there is great interest in improving EFs. It's now clear they can be improved at any age through training and practice, much as physical exercise hones physical fitness. However, despite claims to the contrary, wide transfer does not seem to occur and ‘mindless’ aerobic exercise does little to improve EFs. Important questions remain: How much can EFs be improved (are benefits only superficial) and how long can benefits be sustained? What are the best methods for improving EFs? What about an approach accounts for its success? Do the answers to these differ by individual characteristics such as age or gender? Since stress, sadness, loneliness, or poor health impair EFs, and the reverse enhances EFs, we predict that besides directly train EFs, the most successful approaches for improving EFs will also address emotional, social, and physical needs.",

To this aim, we synthesized five executive functions: inhibition, cognitive flexibility, planning, working memory and generativity and the results of the studies included are presented in terms of the specific tasks employed for each.

The overall orientation of educational thought and practice will largely depend upon the successful elaboration of those problems. Their essence may be concisely expressed as follows: do the teaching and upbringing a person is given determine the processes of his mental development, and, if so, might it then be possible to establish the nature of the link that connects teaching and upbringing with mental development? In other words, is it possible to confirm the existence of developmental teaching and upbringing and, if so, to establish what its regularities are? In everyday life, these problems are sometimes articulated in this form: is it possible by means of teaching and upbringing to shape in a person certain mental abilities or qualities that he previously did not possess?",

      "abstract": "It is often said that a high IQ assured you top position, but it may not make you a top position. IQ may help you in understanding and dealing with the world. At one level, but you need emotion to understand and deal with yourself and intern, with others. Being unaware of your emotions and not being able to recognize and value for feeling and act honestly with them, it is not possible to get along well with others, to get ahead in the world regardless of how Smart you are, and to make decision can be attributed to Intelligence or EQ.Emotional Intelligence encompasses social intelligence and emphasis the effect of emotions on our ability to view situations objectively and thus to understand our self and other people. It is the ability to sense, understand and effectively apply the power of emotions, appropriately challenged as a source of energy, creativity and influence. It includes a person's ability to understand their own emotions balancing and integrating the head and heart, challenged through the left and right brain, is the mission of personal work in domain of emotional intelligence. Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions and emotional knowledge and to promote emotional and intellectual growth ( Mayer & Salovey). According to Salovey and Mayer there are four branches of Intelligence:* Perception, Appraisal and Expression of emotion.* facilitation of change.* Understanding and analyzing emotions, employing.* Reflective regulation of emotions to promote emotional and intellectual growth.A form of intelligence relating to the emotional side of life, such as the ability to recognize and manage one's own and others' emotions, to motivate oneself and restrain impulses, and to handle interpersonal relationships effectively. Daniel Goleman, denoting the cluster of traits/abilities relating to the emotional side of life major components of emotional intelligence: knowing our own emotions, managing our own emotions, motivating ourselves, recognizing the emotions of others, and handling relationships.Daniel Goleman focuses on El as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main El constructs.* Self-awareness the ability to know one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives values and goals and recognizes their impact on others while using gut feelings to guide decisions.* Self-regulation: involves controlling or redirecting one's disruptive emotions and impulses and adapting to changing circumstances.* Social skill: managing relationships to move people in the desired direction* Empathy: considering other people's feelings especially when making decisions and* Motivation: being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement.Self esteem is a term in Psychology to reflect a person overall evaluation or appraisal of his or her own worth. Self Esteem compasses beliefs (For example, I am competent, I am worthy and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame some would distinguish how the self concept is what we think about the self, Self esteem, the positive and negative emotion to the self, is how we feel about it). A person's self concept consists of the beliefs one has about one self, one's self perception or as Hamlyn (1983:241) express it, The picture of oneselfBaumesiter (1997) described self concept as totally perception which people hold about him/herself. It is not the facts about oneself but rather what one believes to be true about oneself (Sarah Mercer). Early researchers used self concept as a descriptive construct, such as 'I am an athlete' (Rosenberg, 1979).A family is the most important social institution an institution that enables children to survive and develop into integrated, functioning persons by augmenting their inborn adaptive capacities. …",

      "abstract": "Mobbing, a rising issue in the occupational health area, has recently been paid attention more and more in the academic and business settings. Mobbing is a series of action having multidimensional features socially and psychologically, and it is frequent in occupational environment. Mobbing may present itself as behaviors, words, acts, gestures, or writings that affect personality, dignity, physical, and psychological integrity. Early 1990’s were the time studies about mobbing started to be done, indicating its negative effects on both individual and the working place. These extend from stress and depression to psychosomatic disorders, and even chronicle diseases and cardiovascular problems. Workplace mobbing is repetitive, unreasonable malicious behavior directed toward an employee or a group of employees, that creates risk to health and safety. It may manifest as intimidation, physical violence, discrimination, threats, social isolation, and destabilization. The most prominent result is lack of continuity. Organizational problems, time pressure, lack of leadership and task definition etc. are defined to be potential risk factors. For prevention, there must be an organized intervention including a strategically approach towards mobbing and a positive environment at workplace. There is a need for standardization, and studies to define and evaluate mobbing behavior in order to make a comparison between different cultures and occupations. In this review article mobbing was examined with the view of public health.",

      "abstract": "Health psychology is a branch of psychology which studies the psychology of the patient’s behaviour, the role of psychic factors in the origin and development of the diseases, the psychology of relationships between doctor, staff and patient, as well as the use of a psychological approach in their assessment and treatment in medical practice. Nowadays, researchers in Health psychology are interested in applied psychology issues conducting research on how patients are treated in hospital, how social factors influence the behaviour of an individual patient, how to motivate health workers to perform at a higher level etc. These research questions cannot be answered by lab experiments as one has to go to the field and the real life situation like the classroom etc., to find answers to the research issues mentioned above. Thus, the quasi-experimental research came into existence. Quasi-experimental research eliminates the directionality problem because it involves the manipulation of the independent variable. It does not eliminate the problem of confounding variables, however, because it does not involve random assignment to conditions. For these reasons, quasi-experimental research is generally higher in internal validity than correlational studies but lower than true experiments. Quasi-experimental research design can be more easily implemented in natural settings and one can make direct assessment of subjects, find out the effects of a specific treatment introduced by the researcher, and while doing so the researcher can also minimise the influence of extraneous variables. In this paper, the quasi - experimental design is discussed for health psychology.",

      "title": "S203. COMPENSATORY COGNITIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVING FUNCTIONING IN PSYCHOSIS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in domains such as attention, memory, processing speed and executive functions are a central feature of psychotic disorders that have significant negative consequences for daily functioning, including activities of daily living, social and vocational roles. Compensatory approaches aim to minimise the impact of cognitive impairment on daily functioning through the use of aids or strategies to reduce cognitive load, in much the same way as glasses reduce the impact of vision impairment. The primary treatment target is real world community functioning and functional capacity, rather than cognition. There is now a need to synthesise the available evidence in this field so that treatment recommendations and future research directions can be better informed. A large body of research into compensatory approaches to cognition in psychosis exists, but this has never been comprehensively synthesised. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the effects of compensatory approaches for cognitive deficits in psychotic disorders on i) functional outcomes and ii) other outcomes such as symptoms and quality of life. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. PsycINFO and MEDLINE electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2017 using multiple terms for ‘psychosis’, ‘cognition’ and ‘compensatory’. All papers retrieved from this search were double-screened and final inclusion/exclusion was determine by consensus. Data were double-extracted and risk of bias rated by two independent authors. Meta-analysis only included randomised-controlled trials. Standardised Mean Differences (SMD) were calculated to produce a single summary estimate using the random-effects model with 95% Confidence Intervals using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. When means or standard deviations were not reported in the original articles, SMDs were calculated from data provided by the study authors. 2192 articles were identified via electronic and manual searches. Forty-two papers describing 40 independent studies were included in the review: case studies (n=4), case series (n=2), uncontrolled single arm pilot studies (n=5), within-subjects designs (n=1), quasi-randomised trials (n=2), and randomised controlled trials (n=26). The types of compensatory interventions included environmental adaptation and supports, internal and external self-management strategies, and errorless learning. Compensatory interventions were associated with improvements in global functioning post intervention (N=1,449; SMD=0.506; 95%CI=0.347, 0.665; p<.001). Improvements in global symptoms (N=849; SMD=-0.297; 95%CI=-0.484, -0.111; p=.002) and positive symptoms (N=784; SMD=-0.227; 95%CI=-0.416, -0.038; p=.018) were also found. Compensatory interventions were not associated with improvements in negative symptoms (N=736; SMD=-0.162; 95%CI=-0.382, 0.058; p=.150). The heterogeneity of findings was low. Compensatory approaches are effective for improving functioning in psychosis, with a medium effect size. General symptoms and positive symptoms appear to benefit from compensatory approaches, but compensatory approaches are not effective for improving negative symptoms. Future analyses will examine the durability of effects, effects of study quality and moderating factors such as pure vs. partially compensatory, treatment intensity/length, mode of delivery (group vs. individual), baseline functioning level and age of participants.",

      "title": "Kompensationsstrategien im Alter",
      "abstract": "Eine Kompensation von Leistungseinbussen oder Handlungsschwierigkeiten ist grundsaetzlich auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen moeglich. Kompensation ist mit technischen Hilfsmitteln und medizinischer Behandlung moeglich. Solche situationsbezogene Kompensation wird durch personenbezogene Kompensation ergaenzt. Sozial-organisatorische Kompensationsstrategien setzen auf Unterstuetzung durch andere Personen. Verhaltensmaessige Kompensation versucht Verhaltensanpassungen, zum Beispiel weniger oder anders fahren. Kognitive Kompensation bezeichnet Veraenderungen in fuer die Taetigkeit relevanten psychischen Hintergrundbereichen wie besondere Aufmerksamkeit, Vorsicht oder Selbstreflexion. Bei motivationaler Kompensation wird bewusst durch erhoehte Anstrengung ein Ausgleich erzielt. Emotionale Kompensation meint die Veraenderung und Anpassung des Erlebens, der Praeferenzen und der subjektiven Wichtigkeiten an die veraenderten Bedingungen. Nicht alle Kompensationen haben bewusstseinspflichtige Voraussetzungen zu durchlaufen. Um Kompensationsstrategien im Alter gezielt anwenden zu koennen, muessen vom Betroffenen zumindest folgende drei Schritte erfolgreich durchgefuehrt werden: 1. Wahrnehmen und Akzeptieren sich veraendernder Faehigkeiten und Grenzen; 2. Erkennen und Auswahl eigener Moeglichkeiten zur Kompensation und 3. Erfolgreiche Umsetzung geeigneter Kompensationsstrategien. Selektive Optimierung mit Kompensation (SOK) traegt nach der Lebensspannenforschung zu einem guten Leben im Alter bei. Aus empirischen Befunden geht hervor, dass aeltere Kraftfahrer zum Ausgleich verminderter Wahrnehmungs- und Reaktionsleistungen vorrangig ihr Verkehrsteilnahmeverhalten veraendern und weniger ihren Fahrstil. Sie betreiben damit Selektion und Substitution auf der strategischen Ebene des Fahrverhaltens. Dass eine Kompensation selbst bei auffaelligen Verhaltensproblemen grundsaetzlich moeglich ist, wird in Deutschland auch bei der medizinisch-psychologischen Eignungsbegutachtung von Kraftfahrern anerkannt. Unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Erhaltung von Mobilitaet und sozialer Teilhabe am Alter waeren Veraenderungen durch Restitution beziehungsweise Training und Substitution gegenueber der Selektion vorzuziehen. Abschliessend werden Ueberlegungen zur geeigneten Auswahl erfolgreicher Kompensationsstrategien formuliert. Zur Gesamtaufnahme siehe ITRD D361701. (KfV/A)",

      "title": "Emotion, Regulation, and Learning across the Adult Lifespan",
      "abstract": "Changes in emotion and emotion regulatory functioning are intimately linked with learning across the adult lifespan. Not only do emotions facilitate learning but persons also learn about their emotions; themselves; their priorities, capacities, and values; the actions of other people; social rules; and the interactions between these phenomena. Following a brief overview of current knowledge regarding age variation in emotion experience, signaling, and physiology, the chapter outlines a view of emotional development and learning based in developmental functionalism. This view suggests that changes in emotion and emotion regulatory development across the adult lifespan are most usefully viewed as reflecting the interactive influences of three age-linked phenomena—changes in normative tasks/goals, changes in relevant capacities, and changes in the tactics used to achieve desired ends. Specific sections are devoted to describing how aging and learning impact (a) tasks, goals, and motivations; (b) organismic physical, recognition, cognitive, self-knowledge, goal management, and regulatory resources; and (c) the tactics different persons use. Overall, it is suggested that a lifespan’s learning regarding one’s resources, capacities, and tactics enables older adults to offset losses in some resource domains with gains in others, a pattern reflected in distinct patterns of emotional and regulatory tactics.",

      "abstract": "Observational methods applied to natural or habitual contexts are scientific procedures that reveal the occurrence of perceptible behaviours, allowing them to be formally recorded and quantified. They also permit the analysis of the relations between these behaviours, such as sequentiality, association, and covariation. In many situations observational methods are the best strategy, or even the only strategy possible: examples are the assessment of low-level intervention programs, interactions between peers, between children and adults, social interactions at different ages, disputes between couples or in the workplace, the behavioural repertoire of the baby, body posture for specific tasks, kinetic non-verbal communication (of teachers, sportsmen and women, actors, etc.), analysis of movement in multiple activities, occupation of a particular space, or the analysis of norms of socialization and desocialization. As we stress, observation in natural contexts involves developing a procedure that highlights the occurrence of everyday behaviours, and permits an analysis of the relations between them. These relations can be identified objectively through the analysis of data linked to the corresponding observational design, combining the qualitative and quantitative perspectives.",

      "title": "Cognitive-Style Approach to Psychological Support of the Gifted Pupils Mountain Schools of the Ukrainian Carpathians",
      "abstract": "The differential-cognitological point of view, giftedness is “a systemic quality of apersonality that develops throughout life and determines their abilities to achieve exceptionallyhigh results in one or more activities compared to those of other people”. Herewith, it is thefundamental concept of general aptitude, under which “the level of general abilities developmentthat determines the range of activities in which a person can achieve great success” is understood.Within the structure of general aptitude intellectual giftedness is singled out as the level ofdevelopment, as well as the type of organization of individual mental experience, which ensure anopportunity of creative intellectual activity, i. e. an activity, related to the creation of subjectivelyand objectively new ideas, to the use of innovative approaches to solving problems and opennessto controversial aspects of the situation and so on. In order to identify talented children and adultsthe value of intellectual quotient (IQ) is still most commonly used. Psychometric approach (themeasurement of psychic phenomena with the help of standardized IQ tests) to the diagnosis ofintellectual giftedness, which is dominant in psychological diagnostics today, by definition, cannot“measure” the phenomena of an individual psyche, since the modern level of psychological sciencedoes not allow to proceed to psychological diagnosis, let alone prediction of a certain person`sbehavior, on the basis of individual results in performing a psychological test (psychometric test ofintelligence, personality questionnaire, projective methods etc).In our opinion, many problems in psychological and pedagogical support of gifted childrencould be avoided by making use of cognitive-style approach to diagnosis of intellectual giftedness,creative abilities, propensities and peculiar mental traits of a separate individuality. Objectivity ofsuch an approach is corroborated by the results of individual cognitive styles (hereinafter CS)diagnostics, carried out by means of experimental techniques. In contrast to standardized tests,such techniques allow to perform diagnostic tests individually and reveal the peculiarities of thearrangement and functioning of an individual mind.Obviously, nowadays we are faced with the need for providing theoretical, methodological andempirical grounds for the development of a conceptual model that would consider giftedness as anintegral psychological system, all aspects of which could be understood in the context of agedynamics and mental experience of an individual. CS approach to interpreting and diagnosis ofgiftedness provides a reliable theoretical basis for working out a systematic methodology ofpsychological diagnostics of the general aptitude, as it meets the basic principles of humanizationof the educational environment in Ukraine. CS approach is child-centered, therefore, it brings infocus individual uniqueness and originality of each child.",

      "title": "Historical and genetic generalization of the evolution of ideas of formation of practical thinking of a personality",
      "abstract": "The article examines the development of ideas on the formation of practical thinking of an individual. Based on the analysis of scientific literature, the evolution of scientific views on practical thinking is considered. It is determined that the essence of practical thinking is inherently focused on ensuring the functioning of human thought processes aimed at solving practical issues and problems that arise in practice and require the use of new schemes of action that have not been used before. The formation and development of practical thinking takes place in the course of a person's direct life activity. Practical thinking is inextricably linked to the specific actions that a person takes. The state of modern scientific research on practical thinking is analyzed: the theory of practical intelligence by R. Sternberg, R. Wagner and the concept of tacit knowledge. A generalizing characteristic of practical intelligence is defined. It is believed that practical intelligence refers to the ability of a person to cope with the problems and situations of everyday life. The author identifies the key characteristics of tacit knowledge that illustrate the statement about practical intelligence and tacit knowledge as constructs that are conceptually different from academic intelligence, technical professional knowledge or personal qualities. Tacit knowledge is viewed as an adaptive intellectual resource that arises as a result of active interaction between people and the dynamic environment around them. It is determined that practical intelligence is based on an abstract or generalized representation of specific procedural rules. In addition, practical intelligence is tied to a specific context and cannot be transferred from one area to another. In the context of practical intelligence, the view of competence is expanded, and it is argued that life success is determined by a person's analytical, creative, and practical abilities, which improve with practice and experience.",

      "title": "Academic Stress in Relation to Self-Efficacy and Peer Pressurez",
      "abstract": "Stress is a part of contemporary living and has become a matter of some concern in field of education. Responses to stress are often uncontrolled and reactionary with physiological, behavioral, and psychological consequences. All incidences of stress are not necessarily negative. Sometimes limited anxiety and tension are essential for optimal performance. The average person has capacity to live through stressful situations-even crisis-and adjust to a normal state when upsetting situation passes. Conversely there are negative results of stress. High level of uncontrolled intense stress may reduce physical resistance, lower productivity; disrupt routines, cause behavior problems, result in physical or mental illness or numerous other anti social conditions.Academic stress is product of a combination of academic related demands that exceed adaptive resources available to an individual. If a student is unable to cope effectively with academic stress, then serious psycho-social-emotional health consequences may result (Arthur, 1998; MacGeorge, Samter, & Gillikan, 2005; Tennant, 2002).Self-efficacySelf-efficacy as defined by Bandura (1997) is the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to produce given attainments (p. 3). These beliefs affect human functioning in four areas: cognitions, motivation, mood/affect, and depressive states (Bandura, 1997). Cognitive implications suggest that individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to set goals for themselves in hopes of attaining lofty aspirations. They tend to visualize their success, think soundly, and commit themselves to challenges at hand. Conversely, those with low self-efficacy are more likely to focus on how things might go array or dwell on their perceived personal deficiencies. In essence these individuals tend to focus on problems of circumstance rather than possibilities of success.Peer pressureThe formation of specific friendships begins to be observed during period from 18 to 36 months (Schneider, 2000). These friendships are indexed by mutual interaction preference, shared affect, scripted regularities in play, and differentially sophisticated play between peers (see Howes, 1996). Indeed, percentage of children at these ages without friends is very small, at least among children in child care settings (Howes, 1983, 1988). Because toddlers' concepts of a friend and friendship are limited (Selman, 1980), it is sometimes assumed that these early friendships are of marginal importance to children of this age. However, children with friends acquire social skills as a result of their participation in these relationships, especially if these relationships are maintained over time (Howes, 1996).Objective of study* To study relation in academic stress and self-efficacy among students.* To study relation in academic stress and peer relations among students.MethodParticipantsThe sample was compared of400 students (200 boys and 200 girls) studying at senior secondary school level. The data was collected from govt and private school of district Hisar, Haryana.InstrumentsStudent Academic Stress Scale (SASS) (A. O. Busari): The SASS was used within current study for an exploratory factor analysis. It is a measure of stress response developed specifically for quantifying stress in university students in stress response domains: Physiological, Behavioural, Cognitive, and Affective. Respondents rate how much of time they experience symptoms on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors None of Time ( 1), A Little of Time (2), Some of Time (3), Most of Time (4), and All of Time (5). Items are summed for subscale scores and subscales are summed for a total SASS stress response score. Higher scores indicate a greater stress response. Items for SASS were generated from a review of general stress and academic stress literature. …",

This can be ascribed to difficulties in the operationalisation of the concept and to neglect of the importance of this essential link in the problem solving cycle. A similar lacuna, however, is not found in early research in the field of problem solving. In problem solving four components can be distinguished: cognitive (sensitivity to problems and formulating the problem), motivational (effectance motivation and curiosity), emotional (wonder and surprise) and, finally, personality components (tolerance for ambiguity, stimulus reduction and self‐confidence). Selective encoding, combining and comparing can be regarded as essential elements of the cognitive component. With respect to the developmental aspects of problem finding, emphasis is laid on the importance of competence motivation and the quality of attachment as determinants. The educational implications are unequivocal: problem solving and problem finding must have equal positions in curricula. For the time being this means that education will have to pay more attention to problem finding.",

      "abstract": "Research confirms the existence of links between a personality's propensity for materialism, and various social and psychological ills: compulsive buying, poorer mental health, etc.The development of emotional intelligence (EI) helps to solve such issues.However, the creation of EI development programme is complex.In addition, sucg programmes developed tend to lack a clear EI model, are not differentiated according to specific participant problems (e.g., materialism), underestimate certain aspects of the change in the EI level, etc.Thus the purpose of the present paper is to present essential EI programme curriculum methodological guidelines and recommendations for the creation of a specialised materialism reduction programme.Results and conclusions.The curriculum must implement the following principles: adaptation according to the participant age and nature of the demonstrated behaviour (in this casematerialism); linking certain tasks to a practical application to develop real-life skills; establishment of objective criteria to assess the EI level and materialism changes at the end of training.The recommended format of the three-stage EI curriculum is: I. Development of selfawareness; II.Self-management training; III.Application of learnt emotional competencies in a group by modelling various situations relevant to participants.A qualified coach must provide ongoing feedback consisting of reinforcement and constructive criticism.Recommended EI training methods: discussion, modelling, role play, etc. Essential factors for the effectiveness of the EI curriculum: selection of motivated participants, coach competence, reliability, validity and objectivity of EI and materialism change measurement tools, transfer of tasks to real-life situations, and measurement of the impact stability after at least 3 months.",

      "title": "Impact of family structure and gender on psychological well-being among college students: a comparative study of nuclear and extended families",
      "abstract": "Well-being is described as the state of being healthy and happy. It requires harmony with mind and body. It can become subjective in nature as different people have different life experiences. It can be used as an umbrella term to define different aspects of our life, such as physical, mental, social, psychological, emotional, digital, economical, and spiritual. These can sometimes be interlinked, such as good physical well-being being associated with good psychological well-being. Psychological well-being can be associated with a feeling of happiness and satisfaction in one’s life, a feeling of self-control and a good state of mind. Being in a good psychological well-being state can be defined as being able to accept and be quite satisfied with what we have in life, having a healthy and positive state of mind, being able to handle our emotions well in difficult situations, and not acting drastically. Psychological well-being (PWB; Ryff, 1989) comprises six dimensions that support positive mental health: autonomy, positive relations, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. It is typically understood as a blend of positive emotional states, such as happiness, and optimal functioning in both personal and social life. The purpose of this research paper is to determine the overall level of psychological well-being among undergraduate students and to assess the impact of demographic factors such as gender and family structure on psychological well-being among college students. For this study, primary data was collected from a total sample of 140 college students using the non-probability sampling method, which included 70 students living in nuclear family and 70 students living in extended family. Students residing in Haldwani city of Nainital district were selected for the study. Psychological well-being scale developed and standardized by Dr. Devendra Singh Sisodia and Miss. Pooja Choudhary was used to measure the overall level of psychological well-being of students. For statistical analysis, Mean, S.D. and t-test were applied. Results revealed that there is a significant difference in the overall level of psychological well-being between students living in nuclear and extended families and concluded that whether an individual lives in nuclear or extended families, it does impact the level of psychological well-being among individuals. The results also revealed no significant difference in the overall level of psychological well-being between boys and girls.",

La neurociencia cogniti-va puede ayudar a clarificar las causas de las dificultades lectoras y a disenar nuevos metodos de intervencion basados en un conocimiento cientifico y riguroso sobre el funcionamiento del sistema cognitivo y de las redes cerebrales que lo sustentan. Ademas, puede ayudar a delimitar que factores posibilitan un desarrollo tipico y una escolarizacion exitosa para mejorar la educacion. La programacion de contenidos y actividades en la escuela deberia tener en cuenta como funcionan los procesos de asimilacion y consolidacion de la informacion en los ninos y como cambian sus redes neuronales con el aprendizaje. Finalmente, puede ayudarnos a determinar que factores neurocognitivos predicen con antelacion diferencias individuales en el aprendizaje y dominio de ciertas habilidades como la lectura, y por tanto a anticipar posibles problemas y recomendar acciones de mejora que permitan sentar las bases de un aprendizaje eficaz",

      "title": "Relating Remedial Strategies to Diagnostic Considerations.",
      "abstract": "how one treats reading disabilities depends upon how one views the process of reading. Many reading specialists view reading disa bility as a disability relating clearly to the reading skill. Thus, reading is perceived as a skill that is learned either adequately or not; and if not learned adequately, then those facets of skills not learned need to be taught, re-taught, and sometimes drilled in order to remedy the reading problem. Another perception of reading is that reading is a caused be havior. One reads adequately or not depending upon many under lying factors. Some underlying factors in a child's development and environment cause him to be a good reader, and some deviations within these factors cause him to be a less-than-adequate reader. Language factors, emotional factors, socio-economic conditions, physiological, and neurological development all are underlying factors that affect how a child reads. From this perception of reading, remedial strategies will evolve that are closely related to each child's total development rather than merely to the child's acquisition or level of reading skill. However, while most reading specialists suggest or even encourage the examination of the underlying factors in a child's development, their remedial prescriptions, in fact, do not really utilize the information gleaned from such explorations. Too often the diagnosis is based on standardized reading tests and reference to cumulative folders. These diagnostic procedures are sometimes not only minimal in value, but can have negative implications as well, since cumulative records more often reveal the prejudices of the teachers than the essence of teacher-pupil interaction and actual pupil functioning. Moreover, standardized silent reading tests rarely tell the teacher more than the fact that a child has answered a question rightly or wrongly. Pursuing the point of relating remedial strategies to diagnostic considerations, certain basic concerns need to be delineated. 1. Reading is perceived as a language-related process which 353",

This chapter is concerned, however, with the ways in which the 'social problem' of intellectual disability has been understood by the state, and the social policies and formal welfare provisions put in place at different historic times to address it. As social work is part of the states' welfare apparatus, the prevailing conceptualization of the problem of intellectual disability at any historic time will strongly influence the roles of social workers, either as part of the system of services or in attempting to reframe and reform policy.KeywordsSocial ProblemIntellectual DisabilityDisable PeopleGroup HomeTraining CentreThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

La solucion no se encuentra en intervenciones simplistas, debiendo ser esta multidisciplinar y llegando a ser tan compleja como multiples puedan llegar a ser los factores que influyen en ella. Desde una perspectiva biopsicosocial, en la explicacion de la conducta problematica debe considerarse factores contextuales (sociales), fisico (estado) y psicologicos (trastornos, estado emocional, conductas), siendo el resultado de la interaccion de variables organismicas y ambientales. Con el objetivo de avanzar en la investigacion de los factores asociados a la conducta problematica, se llevo a cabo un estudio en diferentes servicios residenciales y ocupacionales dirigidos a adultos con discapacidad intelectual, analizando la prevalencia de la conducta problematica y analizando tanto aspectos contextuales como individuales que pudieran estar relacionados. Aunque los analisis se realizaron con instrumentos de evaluacion validados en otras investigaciones, un analisis de los mismos derivo en la elaboracion de una escala breve que permite analizar los posibles vinculos entre diferentes variables personales y ambientales. Dicha escala de 19 items, permite evaluar con brevedad y con las adecuadas propiedades psicometricas, las variables personales (relacionadas con el estado fisico y las habilidades del individuo) que pudieran afectar a la valoracion de los estimulos externos y por ende influir en la probabilidad de manifestar comportamiento problematico. EnglishProblem behavior is a challenge for professionals who must cope with it. The solution is not based on simplistic interventions; it must be multidisciplinary and it may be complicated as many factors may influence it. An explanation of the problem behavior from a biopsychosocial perspective requires consideration of contextual (social), physical (state) and psychological (disorders, emotional state, behavior) factors, as well as the interaction between internal and environmental variables. With the goal of advancing the knowledge of the factors associated with problem behavior, the current study was conducted in different occupational and residential services targeted at adults with intellectual disabilities. The prevalence of problem behaviors and the contextual and individual variables that may be related have been analyzed. Although the analysis was performed using previously validated assessment tools, an analysis of the data led to the development of a brief scale to analyze potential associations between personal and environmental variables. This 19-item scale, with adequate psychometric properties, allows a brief assessment of personal variables (related to physical fitness and skills of the individual) that may impact the perception of external stimuli and thus influence the likelihood of the onset of problematic behavior.",

      "title": "MENTAL PERILS OF UNEMPLOYMENT",
      "abstract": "There is the social, or socio‐economic, problem of unemployment. This problem, as it affects individuals, is not merely the problem of losing a job and finding or trying to find another. It cuts deep into the emotional life, threatens the disintegration of personality, and thus presents a problem of mental hygiene. Instinctive fear gets in its deadly licks. The sense of security is weakened, the sense of inferiority is strengthened. Accustomed activities giving opportunity for self‐assertion and self‐expression are cut off, and the underlying “drives” are blocked or diverted. Neurotic habits and attitudes may develop, and the individual, apart from his mental discomfort, may become unable to function at his normal capacity. In this article the author, understandingly and sympathetically, writes of these dangers to personality and character, explains their mechanisms, workings, and effects, and tells how they may be avoided or overcome. Chief among the means of keeping mentally fit and healthy, during the ordeal of unemployment, is knowledge—particularly self‐knowledge, but also knowledge of economic processes and vocational opportunities. How this knowledge may be used in banishing fear and preserving or regaining self‐confidence and self‐respect is described with many illustrations from actual experiences known to the author. The part played, in this application of intelligence to the personal problem of morale, not only by redirection of instinctive motivations but by loyalty to conscious life‐goals and ideals, is shown by illuminating and inspiring examples.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the characteristics and use of assessments to measure SEL skill development. Both the technical and practical measurement features of four assessments will be examined. The featured assessments are ACT Tessera, SELweb, SSIS SEL Brief Scales, and ZooU. To contextualize the examination of these assessments, we review SEL competencies and skills to be measured and key performance dimensions along which skill development occurs. A broad intrapersonal and interpersonal framework is the starting point for characterizing core competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making. In the absence of consensus developmental base-rates for skills, a performance model is advanced that assumes skills develop through four levels (i.e., emerging, developing, competent, and advanced). At each conceptual performance level, as students enact a skill they exhibit thoughts, emotions, and observable behaviors with increasing acumen. These skill attributes can be assessed along dimensions such as frequency of occurrence, degree of independence, and breadth of application. Against this skill development context and the evidentiary standards of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, &amp; NCME, 2014), we review technical qualities and practical aspects (e.g., time to complete, reports, links to intervention programs) of the featured SEL assessments for purposes of formative and summative measurement and decision making. The chapter concludes with a summary of the technical and practical challenges in the assessment of students’ SEL skill development and recommendations for future research.",

Cognitive evaluations may include simple office-based procedures, but formal neuropsychological testing and functional imaging have aided practitioners in further understanding and treatment of disorders, as well as understanding of normal function. Cognition is a general term used to describe processing information, such as attention, language, memory, decision-making, and problem solving. Cognitive psychology is the specialty of psychology that examines mental processes and studies how individuals perceive, think, learn, and remember.",

Neither abstraction nor specificity, neither controlled nor automatic processes alone are what is needed. Contextually sensitive variation is essential, including rapidly intermixed modes of cognitive control, if we are to realize our fullest capacities for insightful innovation, fluent improvisation, and flexible thinking.",

Here I suggest a framework for approaching these obstacles, constructed from a unified view of human experience (having emotional, existential, and spiritual dimensions); spirituality seen as a response to existential concerns (in domains such as identity, hope, meaning/purpose, morality, and autonomy in relation to authority, which are frequently distorted and amplified in depression); a rationale for locating spiritually oriented approaches within a clinician's assessment, formulation, and treatment plan; and recognition of the challenges and potential pitfalls of integrated treatment.",

Alongside the movement towards more behaviourally inclined approaches has grown a dissatisfaction with the traditional methods of evaluting effectiveness. If we recognize behaviour per se as being the appropriate level for intervention, whether in relation to academic skills teaching, classroom management, social skills training or whatever, then it follows that effectiveness can only logically be assessed in terms of measurable changes in observed behaviour. Evaluation methodology has tended to lag behind interventional methodology, however, so that it has not been uncommon to see behavioural work assessed in terms of changes in attitude and/or knowledge. On occasion evaluation is not even attempted and behaviour change is assumed to generalize outside the specific confines of the intervention situation.",

      "title": "The role of dialogic argumentation in science education for decision-making",
      "abstract": "A common rationale for science education is that learning science improves decision-making. It is argued that students will develop a strong understanding of the ideas and nature of science, which will inform their decisions. Toward this goal, science classroom activities aim to develop students’ scientific literacy, including their capacity to engage meaningfully with scientific ideas. Ideas about the nature of science are advanced through scientific inquiry, with emphasis on developing students’ capacity to articulate scientific explanations for phenomena. The success of this approach for developing students’ scientific literacy is demonstrated. However, evidence to support the success of this approach for students’ decision-making is scant.Knowledge of, and about the nature of, science can assist individuals to evaluate claims made by others, as well as their own beliefs about a scientific issue. However, to genuinely engage in these evaluations, a disposition towards open-mindedness and a valuing of science are necessary. An individual is likely to engage with many socioscientific issues in their personal lives; that is, ill-structured and open-ended issues involving social and other factors beyond the physical and natural sciences. Engaging with these issues requires developed skills of reasoning, including the abductive logic used for reasoning from evidence. Scientific inquiries alone are insufficient for developing students’ decision-making processes, developing open-minded thinking, and the attitudes to science for decision-making in everyday contexts. It is difficult to assess directly an individual’s decision-making. It is feasible, though, to observe how learning science affects students’ performance in several domains related to decision-making, including, but not limited to: their knowledge of science and its nature, skills of reasoning, disposition towards actively open-minded thinking, and attitudes to science. These domains are inherent to dialogic argumentation. Like explanation, argumentation in the science classroom requires students to draw on their ideas of and about science, and reason between evidence and theory, but dialogic argumentation goes further. Dialogic argumentation, framed for tentative consensus, can motivate students to collaborate productively with others, and to engage with socioscientific issues relevant to their personal and social lives. The dialogue requires interlocutors to reason, to critique the reasoning of others, and to engage with feedback to their own reasoning. Students are encouraged to challenge their own and others’ beliefs, interrogate biases, and recognise the limits of knowledge and understanding about the world. They must also consider and negotiate scientific principles and standards of evidence. This study investigated the role that dialogic argumentation in a foundation course in science can play in developing first year preservice primary teachers’ knowledge, skills, and dispositions for decision-making. A quasi-experimental design was prepared to explore the influence of science education, with or without dialogic argumentation, on seven domains that are potentially relevant to decision-making: knowledge of, and about, the nature of science, reasoning, algorithmic thinking, cognitive reflection, disposition towards actively open-minded thinking, and attitudes to science. Throughout the course, a small group of volunteers gathered for an hour each week to engage in dialogic argumentation about a socioscientific issue. These sessions were loosely scaffolded, with direction given about the topics discussed, and some instruction provided regarding successful (and unsuccessful) schemes of reasoning. Data were collected from consenting preservice teachers in both groups. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered using surveys, tests, course assessments, and semi-structured interviews. The data were interpreted to describe changes in and differences between each group. Non-parametric statistical analyses were conducted of matched pairs’ pre- and post-treatment responses, and between groups, to identify changes over time and differences between groups. Toulmin’s Argument Pattern (Toulmin, 2003) and the SOLO Taxonomy (Biggs & Collis, 1982) were both used as frameworks for evaluating reasoning presented in assessments and interviews. The group of preservice teachers who had engaged in dialogic argumentation demonstrated significantly more sophisticated reasoning, both in written argumentation (an optimal response task) and in interviews (a typical response task). They demonstrated more open-mindedness, and were significantly more likely to articulate normative ideas about the nature of science during interviews. Non-significant differences were found between the two groups’ knowledge of science and attitudes to science. These results suggest that dialogic argumentation can improve students’ skills and dispositions for decision-making in a way that scientific inquiry alone may not. This points to the potential value in including opportunities for rich, extended argumentation about socioscientific issues of interest to students in science classrooms. Future research may further elucidate the factors of argumentation that produce these outcomes, or how other outcomes may also be stimulated. At the present, the national science curriculum in Australia does not provide rich opportunities for extended argumentation, and teachers are not well-prepared to develop and enact such opportunities in their science lessons. If decision-making is to continue to be a rationale for science education, more needs to be done to support teachers’ capacity to scaffold and facilitate dialogic argumentation within an open and flexible curriculum.",

Such models also play an important and fundamental role in dialogue and communication processes (writing, reading, talking and listening), thinking and problem solving activities. The formation and subsequent adaptation of mental models takes place throughout a human's life‐span. The 'richness' of an individual's mental models usually increases with his/her growing maturity and exposure to new and varied experiences ‐ and may, ultimately, lead to 'expert performance'. This type of behaviour, within a given subject domain, can often be positively correlated with the quality of the mental models involved. Because of their importance, this paper discusses the basic nature of mental models and the need to provide appropriate environments to stimulate their ongoing development within the context of providing mechanisms for the support of lifelong learning.",

People may self-assess in order to determine their past or future response to situations such as their likelihood of success or the value of their investment of time and effort or the extent of their learning. The accuracy of such self-estimates and the factors determining the accuracy of a person's judgements are therefore salient for adult workplace learning from a practical as well as theoretical perspective.

      "title": "Widening the lens on teaching and assessing clinical reasoning: from “in the head” to “out in the world”",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traditional teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning has focused on the individual clinician because of the preeminence of the information processing (IP) theory perspective. The clinician’s mind has been viewed as the main source of effective or ineffective reasoning, and other participants, the environment and their interactions have been largely ignored. A social cognitive theoretical lens could enhance our understanding of how reasoning and error and the environment are linked. Therefore, a new approach in which the clinical reasoning process is situated and examined within the context may be required. The theories of embodied cognition, ecological psychology, situated cognition (SitCog) and distributed cognition (DCog) offer new insights to help the teacher and assessor enhance the quality of clinical reasoning instruction and assessment. We describe the teaching and assessment implications of clinical reasoning and error through the lens of this family of theories. Direct observation in different contexts focused on individual and team performance, simulation (with or without enhancement of technology), stimulated recall, think-aloud, and modeling are examples of teaching and assessment strategies grounded in this family of social cognitive theories. Educators may consider the instructional design of learning environments and educational tools that promote a situated educational approach to the teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning.",

      "title": "Can Constructive Thinking Predict Decision Making?",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT We assume that executive function constitutes an integrated set of cognitive processes that mediate working memory, planning, inhibition, flexibility, and decision making. Despite the acknowledged theoretical connection between executive function processes and emotional intelligence, such relationships have rarely been investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential relationship between constructive thinking, conceived as a component of emotional intelligence, and executive function, as indexed by various existing neuropsychological and experimental instruments. We used the Constructive Thinking Inventory as a measure of emotional intelligence. We found that some constructive thinking subscales were able to predict distinct executive function variables. Emotional Coping, Categorical Thinking, and Esoteric Thinking subscales explained performance on various measures of executive function. Thus, we conclude that intervention programs designed to train a specific component of emotional intelligence, namely constructive thinking, could also facilitate performance in executive function processes, and vice versa.

Two corollaries require consideration in designing effective skill learning programs. i) Neuro-behavioral constraints, imposed on whether neuronal plasticity is triggered and allowed to proceed, must be satisfied; otherwise, the skill may fail to consolidate into long-term memory. These include the amount of task iterations afforded, task scheduling, behavioral relevancy and the degree of consistency of the to-be-learned experience over a required timewindow. ii) The performance of a given task reflects qualitatively different task solution routines in different phases of experience. Practice, given time and sometimes time-in-sleep, can trigger processes whereby new procedural knowledge and qualitative changes in task solution, emerge and consolidate. These emerging changes in procedural knowledge result in differences in the ability to transfer gains, across stimulus, context and task parameters.",

Practice has changed a great deal over the past century, in response to evolving conceptions of knowledge and its acquisition, views of schooling and its purposes, and technologies for gathering and evaluating response data. Conceptions of what constitutes assessment data, how it should be interpreted, and what kind of inferences are to be drawn can differ radically under different psychological perspectives. We see greater continuity, however, when we distinguish the structure of assessment arguments from their substance. Developments here have been more in the nature of extensions, elaborations, and refinements, as they have been prompted by changes in culture and substance.",

      "abstract": "The human mind is not a general problem solving machine. Instead of deliberately, consciously and serially processing the available information, men can rely on routines, rules, roles or affect for the purpose. They can bring in technology, experts or groups. For all of these reasons, men have a plurality of problem solving modes at their disposition. Often, the meta-choice of problem solving mode matters for behavioural output. Some performance standards are only to be met if a certain problem solving mode is used, like a well-established skill. Other requirements are easier to fulfil with some problem solving modes. This explains why institutions frequently impact on the choice of problem solving mode. To show how institutions are able to do that, a model of problem solving modes is developed. It allows to systematise the access points for institutional intervention.",

      "title": "Acting Up",
      "abstract": "Abstract Despite decades of research, we lack a comprehensive framework to study and explain cognitive development. The emerging “paradigm” of action-based cognition implies that cognitive development is an active rather than a passive, automatic, and self-paced maturational process. Importantly, “active” refers to both sensorimotor activity (in the narrow sense) as well as to autonomous exploration (e.g., as found in active perception or active learning). How does this emphasis on action affect our understanding of cognitive development? Can an action-based approach provide a much-needed integrative theory of cognitive development? This chapter reviews key factors that influence development (including sensorimotor skills as well as genetic, social, and cultural factors) and their associated brain mechanisms. Discussion focuses on how these factors can be incorporated into a comprehensive action-based framework. Challenges are highlighted for future research (e.g., problems associated with explaining higher-level cognitive abilities and devising novel experimental methodologies). Although still in its infancy, an action-based approach to cognitive development holds promise to improve scientific understanding of cognitive development and to impact education and technology.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the three domains of cognition for which the effects of sleepiness are reasonably well understood: attention and vigilance, executive functioning, and learning and memory. It investigates the effects of sleepiness on distinct cognitive processes involved in the performance of cognitive tasks. Sleepiness due to sleep loss or circadian misalignment causes an increase of average reaction times in vigilance and reaction time tasks. Sleepiness has the potential to alter emotional states and bias the interpretation of the emotional context of a situation, and may thereby influence decision-making. Memory encoding, or the conversion of sensory input into a neural representation, appears to be adversely affected by lack of prior sleep. Sleepiness may affect these cognitive processes differentially, so that the effects of sleepiness depend on the ensemble of cognitive processes required to perform the task at hand.",

An alternative to adopting a formal framework of critical thinking which may not be exhaustive or include desirable components, involves working towards the generation of wisdom—defined as the quality of having the experience, knowledge and insight to think and act aptly in a specific context for a particular purpose—as a way for learners to make meanings that potentially have personal and social significance. The article uses a real-world example to illustrate how critical thinking can be driven by inquiry and underpinned by explanation to demonstrate practical knowledge and understanding in specific circumstances.\r\n\tKeywords: wisdom, critical thinking, curriculum, instruction, task design, classroom practice",

      "title": "A Study on Mental Stress among B.Ed Students",
      "abstract": "The nobility of the teaching profession has been extolled in almost every community around the world. Teachers play a pivotal role as the 'future builders' of our country and the respect they command in the general public is unparalleled. The stress response is the body's way of protecting the person. The stress response helps the person to first of all focus completely on one's safety and more precisely the physical safety. A student who is writing his examination, despite having prepared for it for years, if suddenly finds a snake slithering under his chair may immediately jump out and break all the decorum of examination hall. Nevertheless, stress response is not just limited to physical danger. In the highly evolved human lifestyle of today, the psychological danger of being humiliated in front of others, losing a job and thus being threatened of loss of status quo, the possibility of failing in a job interview, the probability of rejection in a relationship – all these can trigger the stress response. The term 'mental stress' is medically associated with pathophysiologic responses such as insomnia, bowel disorders and headaches. The extent of such physiological effects or conditions are based on the severity of the stressor or the strength of the coping mechanism of the individual. A study shows the relationship between cardiac event and 22% cohort of mentally stressful environment. Normative- Survey research is directed towards ascertaining the prevailing conditions. It seeks to answer the question, \"What are the real facts with regards to the existing conditions\". The normative-survey approach is appropriate wherever the objects of any class vary among themselves and one is interested in knowing the extent to which different condition are obtained among these objects. Stratified Clustering sample of 300 students of B.Ed., students were selected from Chennai. The study does not argue that there is no mental stress among the B.Ed., students; it only records that the mental stress is at an average level at this point of time. The key learning points of this study project is quite valid and categorical. The investigator truly believes that if these learning points and some the recommendations are implemented, then we can systematically equip our students to handle mental stress in a productive way.

      "abstract": "La autodeterminación es un constructo clave para garantizar el desarrollo de habilidades que permitan a las personas con discapacidad intelectual adquirir el control sobre sus vidas. Este estudio busca conocer los niveles de autodeterminación de 516 adultos con discapacidad intelectual en proceso de envejecimiento y algunas variables que inciden en su desarrollo. Desde un enfoque cuantitativo, los datos se han recopilado con una escala ad hoc elaborada desde el modelo funcional de autodeterminación. Las evidencias se han analizado mediante estadísticos descriptivos e inferenciales. Los niveles de autodeterminación de la mayoría de los participantes se sitúan en un rango bajo. Los principales resultados muestran cómo el desarrollo de competencias relacionadas con la autodefensa o el autoconocimiento está muy descendido a diferencia de otras habilidades como la realización de elecciones o la resolución de problemas. Además, la severidad de la discapacidad, la edad, el lugar de residencia o el tipo de apoyo se identifican como factores incidentes en el logro de la autodeterminación. La discusión revela, entre otras, la necesidad de priorizar el aprendizaje de competencias relacionadas con la autorrealización como fundamento de las propuestas de intervención en autodeterminación. Este estudio contribuye a enriquecer el grueso de investigaciones sobre autodeterminación en la adultez tardía, siendo este un aspecto apenas abordado en la literatura. Además, complementa los resultados de otras investigaciones con respecto a los factores que pueden condicionar el desarrollo de estas habilidades. Esto permite ir diseñando intervenciones que propicien oportunidades para trabajar la autodeterminación desde las necesidades sentidas de estas personas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Discussions of social stress cannot be easily distinguished from discussions of the life course. Stressors that can contribute to negative health outcomes, whether in the form of major life events and transitions, chronic strains, or daily hassles, are different depending on where an individual currently resides along the life course and on the historical context of his or her experiences. The effect of stress on health can also be mediated or moderated by resources that change over time, such as coping ability, mastery, and social support. The stress process and the life course perspective are thus intertwined in that they inform one another, and understanding how stress affects human development and how aging affects the experience of stress can contribute to social scientists’ understanding of the relationship between stress and physical/mental health.",

They are not just characteristic of each of these virtues, but characteristic of the set of virtues in proper balance.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY In his daily work, guilt and shame and, consequently, punishment and penance do not pass over the psychoanalyst unobtrusively even if the ‘ideal’ basic psychoanalytic attitude demands that he/she be above this kind of human triviality. After all, through his own training analysis and through education he can be (or become) conscious of feelings contrary to the high psychoanalytic expectations of the person behind the couch: to listen patiently, not to react emotionally or aspire after direct gratification, be always understanding and unselfish, never offended, always aiming at insight and, in the end, to make himself redundant. That is the ideal, but what is it like in reality? There is obviously a field of tension, caused not only by one's personal impediments, including one's personal motives to choose this profession, but also evoked by the conventions within one's professional group as a socially defined professional superego. How tolerant are psychoanalysts of each other, is this much aspired inner awareness, for example, actually facilitated or rather impeded, owing to the rigidity of the rules? In any case, the personal superego and especially the ego ideal, in psychoanalysis partly transposed to a professional superego and a professional ideal image, play an important part and contribute to the ultimate result. Inner awareness still seems to be the main thing.",

      "abstract": "The personal development of children in adolescence depends significantly on their ability to respond constructively to crisis situations, avoiding unproductive mechanisms of psychological protection, which are manifested in various forms of deviant behavior. In this context, it is important to study the features and strategies of coping behavior that are used by adolescents in the process of overcoming crisis situations in various spheres of life. Based on the analysis of psychological and pedagogical literature, it was found that coping behavior is a complex of cognitive, emotional and behavioral actions aimed at overcoming external or internal obstacles, assessed by the personality as tense and exceeding its adaptive capabilities. Coping behavior is determined by the subjective significance of the situation for the individual and is aimed at solving the real problem or its emotional experience, correcting self-esteem or regulating relationships with people. Analysis and comparison of different approaches to the classification of types of behavior in crisis situations give grounds to determine several criteria for differentiation of coping strategies: orientation (problem solving, search for social support, avoiding stressful situations); scope of manifestation (behavioral, cognitive, emotional); adaptive capabilities (adaptive, relatively adaptive, non-adaptive).",

      "title": "[Cognitive functions, their development and modern diagnostic methods].",
      "abstract": "Cognitive psychology is an interdisciplinary field whose main aim is to study the thinking mechanisms of humans leading to cognizance. Therefore the concept of human cognitive processes envelopes the knowledge related to the mechanisms which determine the way humans acquire information from the environment and utilize their knowledge and experience. There are three basic processes which need to be distinguished when discussing human perception development: acquiring sensations, perceptiveness and attention. Acquiring sensations means the experience arising from the stimulation of a single sense organ, i.e. detection and differentiation of sensory information. Perceptiveness stands for the interpretation of sensations and may include recognition and identification of sensory information. The attention process relates to the selectivity of perception. Mental processes of the higher order used in cognition, thanks to which humans tend to try to understand the world and adapt to it, doubtlessly include the processes of memory, reasoning, learning and problem solving. There is a great difference in the human cognitive functioning at different stages of one's life (from infancy to adulthood). The difference is both quantitative and qualitative. There are three main approaches to the human cognitive functioning development: Jean Piaget's approach, information processing approach and psychometric approach. Piaget's ideas continue to form the groundwork of child cognitive psychology. Piaget identified four developmental stages of child cognition: 1. Sensorimotor stage (birth - 2 years old); 2. Preoperational stage (ages 2-7); 3. Concrete operations (ages 7-11; 4. Formal operations (11 and more). The supporters of the information processing approach use a computer metaphor to present the human cognitive processes functioning model. The three important mechanisms involved are: coding, automation and strategy designing and they all often co-operate together. This theory has provided a theory. The psychometric approach concentrates on studying the differences in intelligence. The aim of this approach is to test intelligence by means of standardized tests (e.g. WISC-R, WAIS-R) used to show the individual differences among humans. Human cognitive functions determine individuals' adaptation capabilities and disturbances in this area indicate a number of psychopathological changes and are a symptom enabling to differentiate or diagnose one with a disorder. That is why the psychological assessment of cognitive functions is an important part of patients' diagnosis. Contemporary neuropsychological studies are to a great extent based computer tests. The use of computer methods has a number of measurement-related advantages. It allows for standardized testing environment, increasing therefore its reliability and standardizes the patient assessment process. Special attention should be paid to the neuropsychological tests included in the Vienna Test System (Cognitron, SIGNAL, RT, VIGIL, DAUF), which are used to assess the operational memory span, learning processes, reaction time, attention selective function, attention continuity as well as attention interference resistance. It also seems justified to present the CPT id test (Continuous Performance Test) as well as Free Recall. CPT is a diagnostic tool used to assess the attention selective function, attention continuity of attention, attention interference resistance as well as attention alertness. The Free Recall test is used in the memory processes diagnostics to assess patients' operational memory as well as the information organization degree in operational memory. The above mentioned neuropsychological tests are tools used in clinical assessment of cognitive function disorders.",

Although a variety of self-report methods have been developed for and used in research in other areas such as memory, decision making, educational psychology, instruction, and clinical psychology, they have yet to be fully implemented in research on sleep deprivation. Perhaps the most common type of verbal report used in sleep deprivation studies is a measure of subjective sleepiness. The relationship of subjective sleepiness to performance under sleep deprivation conditions, however, is less well understood. An area of research in the sleep deprivation field that is closely tied in with effort to perform well is motivation.",

      "abstract": "In the study of decision-making, the classical view of behavioral appropriateness or rationality was challenged by neuro and psychological reasons. The “bounded rationality” theory proposed that cognitive limitations lead decision-makers to construct simplified models for dealing with the world. Doctors' decisions, for example, are made under uncertain conditions, as without knowing precisely whether a diagnosis is correct or whether a treatment will actually cure a patient, and often under time constraints. Using cognitive heuristics are neither good nor bad per se, if applied in situations to which they have been adapted to be helpful. Therefore, this text contextualizes the human decision-making perspective to find descriptions that adhere more closely to the human decision-making process. Then, based on a literature review of cognition during decision-making, particularly in healthcare context, it addresses a model that identifies the roles of attention, categorization, memory, emotion, and their inter-relations, during the decision-making process.",

      "title": "Differential Schedules of Reinforcement",
      "abstract": "Abstract Differential reinforcement refers to a specific approach to intervention based on operant conditioning that involves programming two reinforcement contingencies. When implementing differential reinforcement, clinicians program a better quality, higher magnitude, or denser schedule of reinforcement for behaviors targeted for an increase as compared to behaviors targeted for reduction. The National Standards Project (2015) review of empirically supported interventions for individuals with autism as well as systematic reviews and recent single-case design studies focused on differential reinforcement were used to inform this chapter. Differential reinforcement has been used to effectively increase and decrease numerous types of target behavior (e.g., language, making choices, sports) and has been found beneficial across populations (e.g., individuals with autism with low to high support needs), ages (e.g., early childhood to adulthood), and settings (e.g., clinics, schools, home or residential centers). Differential reinforcement is a flexible approach to intervention that should be individualized based on behavioral assessment and implemented by a qualified practitioner or well-trained caregiver.",

Retirement has been identified as a significantly stressful event. Work provides both a structured activity within a regular time frame and a sense of purpose and daily meaning. Energy is channelled into intellectual, creative, and/or physical tasks that offer a sense of satisfaction when they are completed. The planning for retirement is associated with successful adaptation. A realization of the potential and rewards of retirement will also facilitate this adaptation.",

Some of the problems now evident in screening programmes, such as low attendance or high levels of anxiety following participation are due in part to an under‐investigation of the psychological processes and outcomes critical to achieving the goals of screening programmes. These goals include high rates of informed participation and satisfactory psychological outcomes of such participation. The development of psychological models in this area may help in documenting the factors mediating and moderating responses to screening, and may suggest interventions likely to facilitate the achievement of the goals of a screening programme.",

Prokrastinasi adalah perilaku manusia yang sering menunda-nunda baik tugas maupun pekerjaan. Kesehatan mental membahas mengenai gangguan jiwa yang dilihat melalui simtomatologi, sedangkan pembahasan mengenai simtom-simtom amatlah banyak, salah satunya yaitu gangguan volisional/ kemauan. Gangguan kemauan ini tediri dari berbagai macam bentuk antara lain abulia (malas), negativisme, rigiditas, dan komplusif. Dari beberapa bentuk gangguan volisional tersebut, maka malas merupakan gangguan yang kerap dirasakan dan melanda setiap orang. Dalam dunia akademik, bentuk malas termanifestasi dalam prokrastinasi (menunda-nunda) tugas perkuliahan, belajar, dan tugas akademik secara umumnya. Banyak faktor yang menyebabkan terjadinya prokrastinasi antara lain konsep diri negative, perfeksionis, distraksi, dan lain-lainnya. Adapaun penangan proktastinasi dapat dilakukan dengan menggunakan beberapa pendekatan dan teknik. Seperti contoh kasus yang dialami Fas, maka penangan kasus tersebut dapat ditangani dengan pendekatan Islami berupa manajemen diri dan waktu, meningkatkan dosis motivasi, menggunakan ego state tharpy , dan teknik SEFT. Pendekatan dan teknik yang ada untuk penanganan kasus prokrastinasi akan menjadi sia-sia jika tidak diimbangi dengan kesungguhan dari procrastinator untuk memulihkan dirinya. Sudah banyak beberapa pendekatan dan teknik dalam penanganan kasus prokrastinasi, namun tidak banyak yang teknik penangan yang dilakukan oleh procrastinator. Semoga kasus saudara Fas dan teknik penyelesaiannya dapat membantu setiap diri yang terhinggapi prokrastinasi. Kata Kunci: Prokrastinasi, Simtom, Kesehatan Mental",

This chapter describes cognitive function using the following variables: general cognitive abilities. decision making and problem solving, capacity for self-reflection and reality testing, mentalization, and judgment. Being able to describe someone's cognitive function is essential to the process of constructing a psychodynamic formulation for several reasons. First, the way we think is key to our function, and thus, we want to be able to hypothesize about its development. Second, the way we think can affect other aspects of our development. Finally, since cognitive functions develop and change over the course of a person's lifetime, carefully observing and describing problems in this area can give us clues as to when problems may have occurred for an individual during development.",

These include conditions such as intellectual disability, autism, mild cognitive impairment, and psychiatric diagnoses. Research participants with cognitive disabilities and differences may be considered a vulnerable population, which may trigger protective responses. At the same time, they should also be empowered to participate in research in order to foster the growth of knowledge and the improvement of practices. For research participants with cognitive disabilities or differences, participating in research that concerns them follows the Disability Rights Movement’s call “Nothing About Us Without Us” and is a vital component of the principle of justice. However, cognitive disabilities and differences may pose challenges to ethical research, particularly with respect to the research ethics principle of autonomy for a variety of reasons. Several alternative or modified strategies, for example when obtaining informed consent, have been used by researchers. The chapters in this volume describe situations where difficulties arise, explore strategies for empowerment and inclusion, drawing on both empirical and normative research to offer suggestions for research design, research ethics, and best practices that empower people with cognitive disabilities and differences to participate in research while respecting and managing potential coercion or undue influence. Contributions from scholars in anthropology, sociology, ethics, child studies, health and rehabilitation sciences, philosophy, and law address these issues in both clinical and social/behavioral research.",

      "title": "Psychology of knowledge representation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Every cognitive enterprise involves some form of knowledge representation. Humans represent information about the external world and internal mental states, like beliefs and desires, and use this information to meet goals (e.g., classification or problem solving). Unfortunately, researchers do not have direct access to mental representations. Instead, cognitive scientists design experiments and implement computational models to develop theories about the mental representations present during task performance. There are several main types of mental representation and corresponding processes that have been posited: spatial, feature, network, and structured. Each type has a particular structure and a set of processes that are capable of accessing and manipulating information within the representation. The structure and processes determine what information can be used during task performance and what information has not been represented at all. As such, the different types of representation are likely used to solve different kinds of tasks. For example, structured representations are more complex and computationally demanding, but are good at representing relational information. Researchers interested in human psychology would benefit from considering how knowledge is represented in their domain of inquiry. This article is categorized under: Psychology &gt; Memory",

The psycho-motor dimension is an optimal way of non-verbal communication in the social environment for the child with autism. It is recognised that any child coordinates his motor activity in accordance with the mental image of the perceived act. Psycho-motor therapy facilitates, through its integrated programmes, the education of the individual, aiming at knowing one’s own body and at the identification of the self.",

Although the theories and the experimental studies project the contour of the subject on the cognitive field from different angles, they raise hypotheses, problems, they provide explanations and solutions, their implications on the learning efficiency and maximization of the psychic capacities of the individual remains a constant theme which is open to research, both from the anatomical- physiological point of view, as well as (or especially!) from the psycho-pedagogical and theoretical-practical points of view.",

      "title": "A Framework to Support Experiential Learning and Psychological Flexibility in Supervision: SHAPE",
      "abstract": "ObjectiveIn this article, we describe a pragmatic framework for supporting supervision, based on a contextual behavioural perspective.MethodThe development of psychological skills to a competent level requires didactic and experiential learning, and supervision is agreed to be a central vehicle for the integration of these experiences. Alongside engaging in problem‐solving and giving instructions (to build adherence), supervisors can reasonably expect supervisees to learn from experience by attending closely to influences and effects of their choices. Experiential learning can help the psychologist to develop sensitivity in applying knowledge and skills in effective and safe ways for clients (thus demonstrating competence).ResultsWe argue that contingency‐shaped learning is strengthened by including supervision elements that promote psychological flexibility (the capacity to actively embrace one's private experiences in the present moment and engage or disengage in patterns of behaviour in the service of chosen values). Psychological flexibility has been found to foster wellbeing, work effectiveness, openness to new learning, compassion, and acceptance of difference and diversity, in workplace settings. Moreover, the psychological flexibility of psychologists has been found to predict the use of evidence‐based interventions, such as exposure.ConclusionThe SHAPE framework identifies five features (Supervision values; Hold stories lightly; Assessment of function; Perspective‐taking; Experiential methods) likely to promote psychologists' psychological flexibility and experiential learning in the supervision context. These five features are extensions of agreed supervision best practices, enhanced by developments in contextual behavioural science (perspective‐taking, cognitive defusion, and acceptance). We describe examples of using SHAPE, and present research directions, to assess whether these features promote experiential learning in supervision.",

      "title": "Simple Heuristics: The Foundations of Adaptive Social Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter shows how simple heuristics can be an essential tool for navigating the complexities and vagaries of social environments. The research program on the nature of social rationality presented here can be summarized by the following theses: As perceived by the human mind, the social world (Umwelt) is complex, but not necessarily more complex than the nonsocial world. However complex the social world may be, its complexity does not require cognitive complexity; rather, it entails conditions that make simple heuristics indispensible, such as intractability, multiple competing goals, and incommensurable reasons. Much of reasoning and decision making occurring in human and animal social environments can be modeled in terms of simple heuristics. Although simple heuristics forgo extensive information search and complex calculations, they can be as accurate and even more accurate than more complex strategies and/or can be used to reach other goals that are valued in social environments (e.g., transparency, fairness, speed). Heuristics can be simultaneously successful and simple by coopting evolved capacities. The capacities themselves can represent complex adaptive specializations (e.g., memory, movement tracking). Simple heuristics per se are neither rational nor irrational. Their rationality is ecological. That is, their performance depends on the match between the architecture of the heuristic and the structure of the environment in which it is used. The heuristics' simplicity inoculates them against overfitting and enables them to achieve robust performance given small samples of information. Simple heuristics can model adaptive decision making both in games against nature and in social games. There is no social intelligence distinct from nonsocial intelligence. Simple heuristics are tools of moderate generalizability. Some can be used only in games against nature, whereas others are restricted to social games. Still other heuristics can be applied in both types of games. Shedding light on the adaptive toolbox of simple heuristics used to navigate social environments, and characterizing their strengths and weaknesses, can help us design environments and/or heuristics in ways that improve public welfare.",

Impairment in social cognition is of particular interest as a mediating influence between cognition and social outcomes. Social cognition is a set of cognitive processes applied to the recognition, understanding, accurate processing, and effective use of social cues in real-world situations. In schizophrenia research, social cognition comprises the following domains: emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and attributional style. While substantial research has indicated that these abilities are clearly related to social outcomes, research has been slowed by problems in the measurement of these abilities. In this article, I will describe these abilities, discuss how they are currently measured, and how research could improve the current measurement of these abilities to make them more clinically useful.",

      "abstract": "SummaryLearning implies interaction between the environment and the individual. Thus processing of perceptual information becomes a crucial factor. Perception includes all the mechanisms used in processing the stimuli of an actual situation. Research findings in normal and sensory-deprived children suggest that perceptual development covers the entire period of acquisition of language and other complex human performances. Furthermore, children and brain damaged adults presenting problems of language and other complex human performances, such as imitation and production of events, also show difficulties in successive pattern and form recognition. The hypothesis is proposed that the adequacy of perceptual processes is a prerequisite for complex human performance. A learning model is described, based on that assumption, and therapeutic consequences are discussed.ResuméApprendre n'est possible sans interaction entre le sujet concerné et son milieu ambiant.

La perception englobe la totalité des mécanismes qui se trouvent activés dans l'analyse sensorielle d'une situation donnée. Les résultats d'investigations réalisées tant chez des enfants normaux que chez d'autres auparavant privés de stimuli sensoriels tendent à démontrer que développement du potentiel de perception s'étend sur toute la période du développement verbal et de celui de divers autres systèmes de performances humaines. Chez l'enfant et l'adulte qui éprouvent une certaine difficulté dans l'expression verbale et dans la réalisation d'autres performances difficiles, telles que l'imitation et l'exécution d'actes complexes, on relève également une difficulté à reconnaître et identifier des formes complexes. Ces constatations amènent l'auteur à formuler une hypothèse selon laquelle l'intégration des divers processus de perception s'avère indispensable dans la réalisation de performances humaines complexes. Un modèle d'apprentissage est présenté, qui s'appuie sur cette hypothèse; on en discute enfin les possibles conséquences thérapeutiques.ZusammenfassungLernen verlangt Interaktion zwischen der Umwelt und der lernenden Person. Die Aufnahme und Verarbeitung einer aktuellen Situation wird deshalb zu einem wesentlichen Faktor, Wahrnehmung wird unerlässlich. Wahrnehmung umfasst alle Mechanismen, welche durch die Analyse der Reize einer aktuellen Situation in Tätigkeit versetzt werden. Forschungsbefunde in normalen und in sensorisch deprivierten Kindern lassen annehmen, dass die Wahrnehmungsentwicklung die ganze Periode der Entwicklung der Sprache und anderer komplexer menschlicher Leistungen beansprucht. Bei Kindern und Erwachsenen mit Schwierigkeiten in sprachlichen und nicht-sprachlichen komplexen Leistungen, so in Nachahmung und Ausführung von Ereignissen, bestehen auch Schwierigkeiten im Wiedererkennen sukzessiver Muster und Formen. Es wurde die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass adaequate Wahrnehmungsprozesse Voraussetzung sind für das Zustandekommen komplexer menschlicher Leistungen. Ein Lernmodell, das sich auf diese Hypothese begründet, wird vorgestellt, und die therapeutisch Konsequenzen werden besprochen.",

      "abstract": "Business presents challenges as persons from various places and disciplines must collaborate to produce a successful outcome. What each person brings to the workplace is unique, yet experiences gained throughout adolescence and adulthood should better prepare the individual for working within the confines of the issues through application of academic preparation. Consider strategies for effective problem-solving (Zwilling, 2011), which are not unlike those which are utilized in doing school-work, such as through addressing word problems. For example, to note just a few…“Take the time to define the problem clearly”; “Iteratively question the cause of the problem”; “Identify multiple possible solutions, followed by “Prioritize [a] potential solution”. The use of word problems to enhance the interdisciplinary experience also provides an assessment tool and a model for ways to engage teams in problem-solving. Communication skills that are necessary for success in the workplace begin well before the persons become adults. This article will strive to introduce the reader to ways that schools may continue to, or begin to become more conscientious in preparing youth for future success.",

      "title": "Sensory Processing and Functional Assessment of Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sensory processing, or the manner in which information from senses and the environment is received, organized, and interpreted by the brain to form an adaptative response plays a significant role in people's ability to participate in everyday life. Sensory processing and sensory preferences vary and are unique to everyone. However, in some instances, the way in which sensory stimuli are processed can be atypical, interfering with the ability to function effectively in different environments. When sensory processing is compromised, people can experience a combination of over- or under-responsiveness to sensory input or have difficulty detecting, discriminating, and responding to sensory stimuli leading to difficulty regulating emotions and maladaptive compensatory behaviors. Understanding sensory preferences and how they influence responses to sensory stimuli as well as developing intervention strategies that align with a person's sensory needs and preferences contributes to increased participation in daily activities, effective adaptative responses to environmental changes, sustained positive social interactions, and regulation of emotional responses. Interest in sensory processing, and more specifically the related concepts of sensory sensitivity and interoception, has been growing in the field of eating disorders. Studies including people with eating disorders have described sensory responses and sensory processing difficulties, their potential impact on eating disorder behaviors and symptomatology, and the assessment of sensory processing. Meanwhile, functional impairment and functional health status have also been explored in the existing literature across health conditions. At times, functional health status and functional impairment have been used interchangeably while more recent literature suggests these be considered as different concepts. Functional health status, whether it focuses on function or functional impairment, is multifaceted, unique to everyone, and influenced by the environments in which people live, making it complex to assess. Historically, functional health status has been assessed using a combination of clinical judgement, nonstandardized and standardized tools, and clinical observations. Adding to the complexity of such assessment, function and functional impairment seem to be mostly associated with physical capabilities where independence or dependence is either based on use of assistive technology, the ability to complete different tasks, organs and body parts function, or participation in social roles. While eating disorders can be associated with limited physical capabilities, the functional health status of someone with an eating disorder includes and goes beyond these capabilities. In this context, this chapter will start with describing sensory processing with a focus on sensory sensitivity and interoception and their presentation in the context of eating disorders. The concept of neurological threshold and its potential use with people with eating disorders will be discussed. Sensory processing assessment tools will be presented. Then, functional impairment and functional health status will be defined and discussed. Lastly, functional assessments and their relevance for people with an eating disorder will be introduced.",

      "abstract": "Despite long-standing commitment to the notion of critical reflection across the healthcare professions it is unusual for critical theory and practice to be taught as explicit subjects in healthcare higher education. There is evidence to show that reflective techniques such as critical portfolios and reflective diaries can help students to consolidate and assess their learning of a discipline and its practices. Yet, there are also known drawbacks of critical reflection, including over self-critical inspection and the infinite regress of reflection on action. This paper offers a theoretically informed model of critical reflection which encompasses different purposes (thinking, learning and assessment of self and social systems), together with different forms of reflection (personal, interpersonal, contextual and critical). Explicitly teaching critical reflection is a logical step towards students being able to recognise and negotiate complex ethical and professional issues. However, teaching critical reflection creates challenges for curricula design, assessment and professional development.",

S'il est communément admis que les actions des individus, groupes et organisations qui travaillent dans de telles conditions vont du conventionnel à l'improvisé, les processus réflexifs et communicationnels qui sous-tendent ces actions n'ont commencé à être examinés que récemment. Ce travail nécessite parallèlement la constitution de séries de données accessibles à tous. Naturellement, l'étape suivante est l'élaboration et l'évaluation de supports qui facilitent la formation et la formulation de politiques publiques concernant les réponses improvisées aux catastrophes. Cet article fait le point sur les travaux existants – ainsi que sur les questions qui n'ont pas encore été abordées – afin de comprendre l'improvisation (par la théorisation et la collecte de données) et de la soutenir (par la formation) dans le contexte d'interventions d'urgence. Divers exemples, tirés d'études antérieures ou en cours portant sur l'improvisation lors d'interventions d'urgence, illustrent les arguments de cet article, et permettent d'ancrer ce travail dans la réalité concrète des recherches de terrain sur ce phénomène tout à fait remarquable mais particulièrement fugitif.",

      "abstract": "Sociempathy is a form of social perception which refers to an individual's awareness of his own and others' sociometric status in a given group of which he is a member. Among other properties this content of awareness may be more or less accurate, i.e., may correspond more or less to the actual situation with respect to sociometric status depending on sociempathic ability. Hence from an operational standpoint, a person may be said to have good sociempathic ability if he can accurately predict the relative degree of acceptance or rejection accorded the component members of the group (including himself) by the other group members. In general, the few available studies we have in the area of sociempathy have dealt with the sociempathic ability of teachers (i.e., their ability to predict the sociometric status of their pupils), and have ignored the pupils' awareness of their own status and that of their classmates. As a result, at least two large gaps remain in our knowledge of the development of social perception in children: What does the growth curve for sociempathic ability look like? What are some of the determinants and consequences of individual differences in sociempathic ability? The present study represents an exploratory attempt at devising a method for measuring various developmental aspects of sociempathy, i.e., growth curves, changes with age in the distribution of ratings and predictions of status, and teachers' sociempathic ability.",

A research taking into consideration variables such as learning styles, features of personality such as extraversion vs introversion, sensing vs intuition, thinking vs feeling and judging vs perceiving may provide data essential to protect managers from this unwanted psychological phenomenon. Burnout syndrome, invented as a concept in 1970, according to the Maslah Burnout Inventory (MBI) is consisted of three aspects: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. Burnout syndrome is indicated by lower scores on the personal accomplishment and higher scores on the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. This psychological phenomenon leads to gaining less satisfaction from work that seems to be a significantly important problem in the contemporary job market, especially among managers. It is strongly connected with the intensity of stress at work. If stress is permanent and not handled appropriately impairments of cognitive abilities such as declined attention and perception may occur. Some features of personality can also be correlated with higher susceptibility to stress and the risk of burnout syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of the problem of psychological assistance to a personality who has long been in extreme and crisis conditions of public life. The author analyzes the concept of «Psychological health of the personality», outlines the pathogenic consequences of being in stressful and crisis conditions, namely: the formation of neurotic traits that interfere with personal functioning (obsessive recollection of horrible episodes; feelings of depression, fear, anxiety, alienation, guilt, loss of normal interests, increased excitability, irritability, which can lead to an emotional outburst, uncertainty in the future, difficulty concentrating, communication difficulties).There where studied the features of destructive qualities which are formed due to influence of extreme factors. The author defines the criteria of psychological health of the personality (the spiritual orientation, the moral attitude of the individual to himself, to others, (trust, love), the ability to cope with life problems, to effective, creative activity, the stress resistance, the self-worth of each person, the adequate expression their thoughts, feelings, the responsibility, the congruence, the optimism, the adequate level of demands, the independence, the sense of humor, the tolerance, the self-esteem). The psychological determinants of harmonizing mental health are: a positive thinking, an emotional resilience, a tolerance to stress, and a balance in relationships with other people. The article identifies the features of psychological care and areas of psychological rehabilitation of persons who have long been in emotionally stressful conditions. The author considers the psychological determinants of harmonization of psychological health of the personality.As a result of empirical research, have been formulated the methodological recommendations for harmonizing the psychological health of the individual in conditions of mental stress in society.",

      "abstract": "Wise decisions are often guided by an accurate understanding of the expected values of different possible choices. In social contexts, wisdom comes from understanding how others are likely to respond to one’s actions, enabling people to make choices that maximize both their own and others’ outcomes. Our research suggests that miscalibrated social cognition may create a systematic barrier to wiser decisions in social life. From expressing appreciation to offering support to performing acts of kindness, this program of research indicates that decisions to engage with others are driven by how people expect a recipient to respond, but that people consistently underestimate how positively others will respond to their other-oriented actions. Because connecting with others consistently increases people’s own wellbeing, miscalibrated social cognition may lead to undersociality: being overly reluctant to reach out and connect with others. Miscalibrated expectations about social engagement can create markets for products that help people overcome these barriers in order to consume their time, money, and effort more wisely.",

      "title": "Acting Up: An Approach to the Study of Cognitive Development",
      "abstract": "Despite decades of research, we lack a comprehensive framework to study and explain cognitive development. The emerging paradigm of action-based cognition implies that cognitive development is an active rather than a passive, automatic, and self-paced maturational process. Importantly, active refers to both sensorimotor activity (in the narrow sense) as well as to autonomous exploration (e.g., as found in active perception or active learning). How does this emphasis on action affect our understanding of cog-nitive development? Can an action-based approach provide a much-needed integrative theory of cognitive development? This chapter reviews key factors that infl uence development (including sensorimo-tor skills as well as genetic, social, and cultural factors) and their associated brain mechanisms. Discussion focuses on how these factors can be incorporated into a comprehensive action-based framework. Challenges are highlighted for future research (e.g., problems associated with explaining higher-level cognitive abilities and devising novel experimental methodologies). Although still in its infancy, an action-based approach to cognitive development holds promise to improve scientifi c understanding of cognitive development and to impact education and technology.",

However, the effectiveness of a visualisation may be intrinsically related to, and difficult to distinguish from, individual-level factors such as visualisation literacy. Complicating matters further, visualisation literacy itself is not a singular intrinsic quality, but can be a result of several distinct challenges that a viewer encounters when performing a task with a visualisation. In this paper, we describe how such challenges apply to experiments that we use to evaluate visualisations, and discuss a set of considerations for designing studies in the future. Finally, we argue that aspects of the study design that are often neglected or overlooked (such as the onboarding of participants, tutorials, training, etc.) can have a big role in the results of a study and can potentially impact the conclusions that the researchers can draw from the study.",

      "abstract": "Self-regulated learning is the process by which effective learning happens: an iterative cycle of judging what has been learnt, followed by making decisions on what to invest effort in to learn further.When this process works well, learners can accurately assess their progress towards a desired outcome (e.g.mastering a skill, or passing a course), and make decisions about how to invest their limited time and resources to maximise learning.However, not all learners have the skills which underpin self-regulated learning, as learners may have poor judgement about how their learning is progressing.For example, they may believe that they understand the content and are progressing well, but they instead have a shallow understanding and are not meeting their learning goals.Learners' decision-making capabilities also vary in effectiveness.Some learners in tertiary education settings, for example, invest time in learning activities that develop procedural learning, or passive activities such as re-reading information or re-watching videos.These activities give the learner a sense of familiarity with the content without developing the conceptual learning required to master the topic and pass an exam.Furthermore, judgement and decision-making are connected: learners who choose ineffective (e.g., passive) learning strategies gain less information about their learning than those who invest time in more effective activities.Here, we use a mathematical model, consisting of coupled ordinary differential equations, to explore interactions between the processes which underpin self-regulated learning.Our results provide evidence for two distinct self-reinforcing learning regimes: an unproductive regime in which poor judgement and poor decision-making undermine learning (and ultimately wellbeing), and a productive learning regime characterised by good judgement and decision-making.We predict that students with good judgement and poor decision-making (or vice versa) exist in unstable intermediate states.We also model interventions that can shift students from unproductive to productive regimes and discuss their implications for designing effective education.",

Diversas investigaciones desde diferentes perspectivas se han interesado en explicar las causas de dichas dificultades. Entre estas investigaciones, se esta brindando importancia a las funciones ejecutivas, puesto que son habilidades cognitivas propias de la corteza pre-frontal (CPF) que guardan relacion entre si, e incluye habilidades vinculadas a la capacidad de establecer metas, organizar y planificar tareas, seguir secuencias, iniciar un plan y sostenerlo en la mente mientras se ejecuta, inhibir las distracciones, cambiar de estrategias de modo flexible si el caso lo requiere, autorregular y controlar el curso de la accion para asegurarse que la meta propuesta sea lograda. Todas estas funciones estan relacionadas con la capacidad de resolver problemas matematicos, en consecuencia, la alteracion de estas puede limitar la capacidad del individuo para mantener o realizar una actividad matematica, con exito.",

      "title": "Reasonable or Ridiculous? Engineering Intuition in Simulations",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is not sufficient for engineers to be proficient in complex calculations or the simulation software that may perform these calculations, but essential to also be able to evaluate whether a result is “reasonable or ridiculous.” Teaching this type of “engineering intuition” is not always as straightforward as teaching technical material. For example, oftentimes students complete computer simulations without questioning if the assumptions or results are practical. Do certain types of learners question the simulations more often? Does internship experience lend itself to a better “engineering intuition” in the classroom? To answer these questions, learning styles, which describe how individuals gather and process information, and internship experience were analyzed against answers to open-ended questions at the end of simulation-based problems designed to push students to evaluate the practicality of their results. The learning style model used was the Felder-Silverman model of four learning style dimensions, with two preferences per dimension, (active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, sequential/global) that categorize individuals based on how they best process, perceive, receive, and understand information. It is important to emphasize that learning styles are preferences, not absolutes, and the Felder-Silverman model takes this into consideration by categorizing individuals as “balanced,” “moderate,” or “strong” with respect to a preference (within a dimension). Previous work in learning styles and simulations by Montgomery (1995) suggested that simulations and other multimedia tools can be used to engage students from a greater variety of learning styles (as compared to traditional classroom methods), however, whether some students may be more “simulation dependent” (less likely to question simulation results) is unclear. Data on student responses to simulations (ability to identify and justify whether a simulated case is practical) is being collected at multiple points during the semester. As the complexity of problems being solved increases throughout the term, there is a greater likelihood of observing differences among students in ability to assess the practicality of a situation and identifying commonalities among successful or unsuccessful students. The study consists of one section of an undergraduate course in chemical engineering at a small East Coast university and two sections of an undergraduate course in aerospace engineering at a small Southwestern university taught by two different instructors during Fall 2015 (data collection underway, complete results will be available by full submission dates). The study will also be conducted in spring 2016 with one section at each university with results available by June 2016. These results will inform future avenues of study, and eventually, after a multiple semesters of evaluation are complete, we will propose a new course model that helps students question their results and gives a better understanding of how to teach “engineering intuition” to students.",

      "title": "Health and Adaptation in a Multiple Self",
      "abstract": "It has been suggested recently that the self consists of multifaceted aspects which are not reducible to a singular core or entity. It is unclear whether the degree of multiplicity that individuals with significant pathology experience is linked with health and adaptation. Both an excess and a restricted degree of activity among multiple aspects of the self have been associated with pathology. We explore the evidence that the impact of degree of multiplicity of self upon adaptation may be mediated by: (a) the capacity of the various aspects of the self to engage in a dialogue among each other—that is, to discuss, build upon, or argue with one another; and (b) metacognitive capacity, or the ability to think about one’s own thinking and the thinking of others in a nuanced way and to build an integrated view of different aspects of oneself and others. Implications for conceptualizing psychopathology and psychotherapy research are discussed.",

      "title": "Social Desirability Bias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Social desirability bias refers to the tendency of research subjects to give socially desirable responses instead of choosing responses that are reflective of their true feelings. The bias in responses due to this personality trait becomes a major issue when the scope of the study involves socially sensitive issues such as politics, religion, and environment, or personal issues such as drug use, cheating, and smoking. Whenever possible, it is desirable to measure the extent of the bias present in responses to a survey by incorporating a socially desirable scale in the survey. A number of methods to address this issue are suggested in the literature. Use of a well‐trained interviewer or collection of data through methods that do not require presence involvement of an interviewer can help avoid this bias to some extent. Properly identified options to questions vulnerable to social desirability effect is another means of tackling this issue.",

      "abstract": "Personal reminiscences and reflections, even if they relate to experiences shared by the reader, may seem out of place in an evaluation of psychometrics. The virtual demise of personality testing in practice has attracted less attention than it might for there are lessons to be learnt from it. Both personality and intelligence tests have failed conceptually in terms of the assumptions that initially led to their widespread development; unlike intelligence tests, however, personality tests have also proved an empirical failure. In practice, an assessment by an educational psychologist has tended to peter out just at the point where it could become useful. Having expropriated testing activity psychologists now find that to do their job properly they have to hand it back. The concepts and techniques of psychometrics are valid only so far as they enable the reader to facilitate the process of educational and personal development in children: the failure of psychometrics has been the poverty of its contribution.",

      "abstract": "Mental soundness is a condition of well-being wherein a person understands his/her potential, participates in his or her community and is able to deal effectively with the challenges and obstacles of everyday life. It circumscribes how an individual thinks, feels and responds to any circumstances. Mental strain is generally recognised as a social concern, potentially leading to a functional impairment at work. Chronic stress may also be linked with several physiological illnesses. The purpose of this research stands to examine existing research analysis of mental healthiness outcomes where diverse Deep Learning (DL) and Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied. Applying our exclusion and inclusion criteria, 52 articles were finally selected from the search results obtained from various research databases and repositories. This literatures on ML and mental health outcomes show an insight into the avant-garde techniques developed and employed in this domain. The review also compares and contrasts amongst various deep learning techniques for predicting a person's state of mind based on different types of data such as social media data, clinical data, etc. Finally, the open issues and future challenges of utilising Deep learning algorithms to better understand as well as diagnose mental state of any individual were discussed. From the literature survey, this is evident that the use of ML and DL in mental health has yielded significant attainment mostly in the areas of diagnosis, therapy, support, research and clinical governance.",

      "title": "Manager’s Professional Creativity as a Practice-Oriented Level of Performing Professional Activities",
      "abstract": "The aim of our article is: to explain manager’s professional creativity as a practice-oriented level of performing professional activities, taking into attention measurement of creative abilities, intellectual initiative, a cognitive-motivational component of professional creativity, the reflective aspect of self-awareness, the processes of reflection of the activity, transcendence, self-identification and other self-transforming processes. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, generalization. The results of the research. The systematic solution of the problem of professional creativity allows us to define it as an expedient, purposeful theoretical and practical activity of the manager, which is distinguished by novelty, originality, non-standardity in general social, group or individual plans. In the process of professional creativity the realization of the bioenergetic, intellectual, emotional, and physical forces of a person directly leads to a socially significant result. This content of the concept of “professional creativity” can be considered as a starting point for clarifying the essence of the professional creativity of a manager in any field of his/her activity. In contrast to the existing definitions of professional creativity, it fixes the main, basic feature – professional activity that is the most appropriate for a person, which is characterized by novelty both in terms of the content of the activity and in the relation to its results. Conclusions. Therefore, the development of professional creativity as a process of qualitatively new creation becomes possible if a person as a bearer of creative intentions is transformed to the status of a self-creative, self-competent individual. In other words, professional creativity requires the use of considerable personal potential and the ability to fully utilize it. Professional creativity, embedded in the process of professional innovations, innovations in any spheres of professional activity, is realized in the processes of reflection of activity, transcendence, self-identification and other self-transforming processes.",

      "title": "Habilidades de autorregulación y evaluación on-line del proceso de resolución de problemas matemáticos",
      "abstract": "La resolucion de problemas matematicos es muy frecuente en la edad escolar. Sin embargo, se trata de una actividad compleja, cuya correcta ejecucion depende de multiples factores. En este sentido, la evidencia cientifica sugiere que, para ser exitosos, los estudiantes necesitan, entre otras cosas, ser autorregulados en su actividad de resolucion de problemas, ejerciendo un control eficaz sobre sus procesos cognitivos, afectivos y conductuales. No obstante, estudios previos senalan que estudiantes en diferentes etapas educativas muestran a menudo dificultades para gestionar estos aspectos. Una evidencia a favor de esta afirmacion procede del analisis del proceso metacognitivo llevado a cabo por los estudiantes durante estas tareas. Este analisis ha revelado la existencia de patrones de resolucion ineficaces por parte de muchos estudiantes; con escasas habilidades de planificacion y de evaluacion de la actividad, asi como una marcada preferencia por procedimientos familiares como la ejecucion de calculos como medio para resolver los problemas. Estos patrones de resolucion ?denominados procesos en esta Tesis Doctoral- se traducen a menudo en un bajo rendimiento en la tarea, asi como en la formulacion de juicios poco realistas acerca del resultado alcanzado. Este componente de juicios esta estrechamente relacionado con la ?calibracion?, o grado en el que la percepcion de una persona sobre su ejecucion se corresponde con su ejecucion real, establecida esta en funcion de una medida objetiva como la puntuacion en un test. La calibracion supone un importante mecanismo metacognitivo, y ejerce un efecto positivo sobre el rendimiento en matematicas y resolucion de problemas. No obstante, los estudiantes son a menudo imprecisos en sus juicios, mostrando un exceso de confianza. Estos sesgos de percepcion tienen ademas a ser estables, con efectos negativos sobre el rendimiento, pero tambien sobre el esfuerzo, la persistencia y el interes de los estudiantes hacia la asignatura o la tarea. Esto hace preciso examinar los factores relacionados con la formacion de estos juicios. Un aspecto importante en esta Tesis Doctoral es la distincion entre los juicios realizados antes (predicciones), y despues (postdicciones) de la ejecucion. Los ultimos han mostrado ser mas fiables y precisos, puesto que se basan en el feedback procedente de la realizacion de la tarea, y serian informativos de mecanismos de monitorizacion durante la misma. Este aspecto hace a estos juicios especialmente interesantes desde el punto de vista del analisis del proceso en resolucion de problemas. No obstante, el potencial explicativo del proceso sobre estos juicios no ha sido explorado hasta la fecha. Adicionalmente, pocos de los estudios realizados con el fin de establecer los determinantes de estos juicios se han hecho en Educacion Primaria, ni se han realizado desde un punto de vista comprensivo, centrandose en aspectos aislados en su lugar. En este sentido, la presente Tesis Doctoral ha tenido estos objetivos: - Disenar y poner a prueba un metodo de evaluacion del proceso en resolucion de problemas matematicos. - Delimitar el potencial explicativo del proceso en la precision de los juicios realizados tras la ejecucion de estas tareas. - Analizar el efecto que otras variables cognitivas, afectivas, motivacionales y conductuales tienen sobre estos juicios. Se conto con 524 estudiantes de quinto y sexto curso (10-13 anos), los cuales realizaron dos problemas matematicos verbales basados en la vida real. Los resultados indicaron la presencia de patrones de resolucion de problemas poco efectivos y un bajo rendimiento en las tareas. No obstante, las estrategias de representacion y organizacion de la informacion mostraron ser importantes en el exito en resolucion de problemas. Los estudiantes fueron ademas poco precisos en sus juicios, mostrando un exceso de confianza. Los mas calibrados mostraron estrategias de planificacion mas eficaces en resolucion de problemas, mientras que los poco calibrados tendieron a emplear estrategias basadas en ensayo y error. El rendimiento en matematicas mostro ejercer un efecto sobre la calibracion, explicando ciertas diferencias previas en planificacion. La precision de los juicios se relaciono tambien con: mejores habilidades de funcionamiento ejecutivo en planificacion, organizacion, memoria y atencion, y menor impulsividad; creencias, motivaciones y actitudes mas positivas hacia las matematicas; y un mayor tiempo empleado en la resolucion de problemas. Finalmente, el rendimiento en matematicas, la utilidad percibida de la asignatura y el tiempo en resolver el primer problema matematico predijeron significativamente la precision de estos juicios, clasificando correctamente al 71% de la muestra. Estos resultados muestran la utilidad del metodo de evaluacion disenado como medida del proceso de resolucion de problemas matematicos y la necesidad de considerar un amplio rango de variables cuando las diferencias en calibracion quieren ser explicadas.",

      "title": "Self-Efficacy and Adjustment among Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Self-efficacy has been conceptualized as a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform a behaviour, task or skill (efficacy), and the belief that one's behaviour will result in a particular outcome (outcome expectations) (Bandura, 1986). The concept of self-efficacy was developed by Bandura (1977) as a key concept of his social learning theory. Though it is much similar to, but is not identical to the concept of expectancy. Where expectancy specifies only the effort as a cause of performance, the term self-efficacy refers to the expectancy of succeeding at a task resulting beliefs in one's overall performance competence. Self-efficacy is one of the important self related cognition, which relates to the individuals sense of personal efficacy to produce and regulate events of their life. Bandura (1986) defines it as, judgments of their capabilities to organize and execute course of action required to attain designated types of performances. Self-efficacy beliefs also affect adjustment through their influence on the students' goal setting, persistence, and emotional adaptiveness.Self-efficacy beliefs are not fixed acts or simply a matter of knowing what to do. Rather it is a generative capability in which all the cognitive, affective and cognitive components and social and behavioral skills must be organized into integrated course of action to serve innumerable purposes. wholesome organization of these self-referent beliefs can stem from many sources including attributions about the causes of previous successes and failures, perception of the situation and one's ability, adaptability, creativity and ability for personal control (Wood & Locke, 1987), employment status, social support and gender. Perceived self-efficacy is an individual's estimate of his capability of performing specific set of actions required to deal with environmental conditions. It has been proved to be a powerful personal resource of having impact of stress on cognitive appraisals as well as on psychological and physical well-being (Jerusalem & Mittag, 1997). Highly self-efficacious individuals perceive the new demands of life more as challenges and less as their acts. They experience lower anxiety, better health and fewer health complaints than the low self-efficacious individuals. A strong sense of personal efficacy seems to reduce the likelihood of negative appraisal of stressful life demands, and, as a consequence, it provides protection against emotional distress and health impairments by changing risky health behavior through personal action.Many theories of self-efficacy evolved over the years to discuss centrality of control in human lives (e.g., Adler, 1956; White, 1959), people's level of motivation affective states and actions are based more on what they believe rather than what objectively the case is. So individuals' self-referent beliefs for their causative capabilities need to be inquired along with their origin, structure, functions, processes through which they operate and their effects; and the self-efficacy theory addresses all these sub-processes both at the individualistic and collective level. People make causal attributions to their own psychological functioning through mechanisms of personal agency, and amongst these, individual's beliefs of personal efficacy are of central importance. Bandura and his colleagues have made series of experiments to illustrate the causal the power of self-efficacy (e.g.; Bandura, 1982; Bandura & Cervone, 1986; Bandura & Schunk, 1981) in human functioning.Adjustment and Self SefficacyGood (1959) states that adjustment is the process of finding and adopting modes of behavior suitable to the environment or changes in environment. Adjustment is the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influences the satisfaction of these needs. Kulshrestha (1979) explained that the adjustment process is a way in which the individual attempts to deal with stress, tensions, conflicts etc. …",

A holistic, rather than a scientific view, of knowledge is adopted. The discussion is also underpinned by a pragmatic approach that incorporates rational, emotional, psychological, and spiritual perspectives. While multiple worldviews are considered, the discussion is situated in an integrated participatory paradigm. A plan for developing mindfulness within organizations is described that includes consideration of multilayered development and ordered, unordered, and disordered organizational arenas. Complexities abound when both individual and group maturity levels on developmental layers diverge widely. Integrated wisdom is only achieved when consensual alignment is achieved. Integrated wisdom allows for this complex mix, is aware of the appropriate level and type of communication and or interaction required, and acts accordingly without prejudice or judgment. Implications for the future of mindfulness as a necessary skill for integrated wisdom are also explored.",

      "title": "What binds professional judgment?: The case of teaching",
      "abstract": "Introduction\nJudgements in teaching include both instructional (epistemic) and regulative\n(moral) aspects. Teachers have to exercise professional judgement when selecting\nemphasis for the content to be taught, designing a sequence of contents in a speciﬁc\ntopic, choosing correct examples to demonstrate a concept, interpreting learners’\nerrors, dealing with cultural differences among learners, and so forth. Some of\nthese decisions are subtle, others are explicit. Some are made in situ and others\npre or post facto. Broadly, there is an agreement that professional judgement in\nteaching derives from theoretical knowledge (educational theories and subject\nmatter knowledge; this chapter will concentrate on educational theories), and from\nworking knowledge (variety of contextually speciﬁc experiences). What is less clear\nis how theoretical knowledge, which is formal, systematic, ordered and context\nindependent, informs teachers’ professional judgement that is situated and\ncontext-dependent. Concepts developed to explain this relation such as ‘reﬂection\nin action’ (Schon 1983) and ‘situated learning ‘(Lave and Wenger 1991), locate\nprofessional judgement in everyday professional practice, attempting to create ﬁner\ndistinctions within informal learning, but neglect the role of theoretical knowledge\nin the exercise of professional judgement. This is a serious neglect (Muller 2009;\nYoung 2010; Young and Muller 2010; Winch 2010; Kotzee, 2012) that must\nbe addressed, if teaching is to be considered a ﬁeld of expertise; if a judgement\nmade by teachers is to be distinguished from an ordinary judgement. Placing\nteachers’ judgement primarily in experiential knowledge contributes to further\nde-professionalisation in teaching.",

      "abstract": "Over the years, students in our research seminars have repeatedly asked some of the same questions when puzzled, confused, not yet grasping, or psychologically thrown by certain features or procedures in learning the grounded theory style of analysis. Most questions arise because a student's stage of development does not yet allow him or her to answer those questions: For instance, “How do I know when I have a category?” and later, “a core category?” Other questions arise because students are plagued by lingering doubts about the validity or efficacy of grounded theory (and qualitative analysis generally), having been schooled or partly sold on quantitative methods. Hence, questions are raised about sampling, reliability, and so on. Associated questions pertain to how to convince others who are committed to quantitative methods about the validity or reliability of the qualitative methodology that the students are learning. Other questions stem from puzzlement about some procedures, like converting questions of psychological motivation into sociological questions and analysis. And understandably, there are still other sets of queries about how to write up the results of analysis for publication or speech making.",

      "title": "Do Conscious Thoughts Cause Behavior?",
      "abstract": "Everyday intuitions suggest full conscious control of behavior, but evidence of unconscious causation and automaticity has sustained the contrary view that conscious thought has little or no impact on behavior. We review studies with random assignment to experimental manipulations of conscious thought and behavioral dependent measures. Topics include mental practice and simulation, anticipation, planning, reflection and rehearsal, reasoning, counterproductive effects, perspective taking, self-affirmation, framing, communication, and overriding automatic responses. The evidence for conscious causation of behavior is profound, extensive, adaptive, multifaceted, and empirically strong. However, conscious causation is often indirect and delayed, and it depends on interplay with unconscious processes. Consciousness seems especially useful for enabling behavior to be shaped by nonpresent factors and by social and cultural information, as well as for dealing with multiple competing options or impulses. It is plausible that almost every human behavior comes from a mixture of conscious and unconscious processing.",

      "title": "Creativity and Its Intrapsychic Bounds",
      "abstract": "Summary The study deals with some theoretic issues as a result of investigations on talent and creativity development in Slovakia. In the second part some examples of two factor-analytical studies concerning intra-psychic bounds of creativity (differentiated into several factors) with sense of humor, prosocial behavior and coping with stress are presented. Key words: Creativity, talent, factor analysis, sense of humor, prosocial behavior, coping with stress, school achievement, soccer performance Creativity and its intra-psychic bounds Creativity, as a matter of fact, is the only capability that distinguishes a man from other beings. There do exist the following three axioms (according to our long-term studies): 1. Creativity is the ability of every human being. 2. We can find it in every human activity. 3. It can be developed not only by special programs (what a luck for many of our collegues) but also throughout education or the family and last but not least it is influenced by the way and of course the quality of life. As known, creativity goes hand in hand with talent (or giftedness - we do not distinguishes these two terms and use them as synonyms, as according to the literature, there are not very plausible differences in theoretical explanations). Maybe the highest one could be the so-called The results of our investigations on talent development (Dockal & T. Kovac, 1993) can be summarized in the following thesis: 1. A gift (talent) is formed on the basis of genetic dispositions throughout life. The conditions of the environment and the very activity of an individual are significant factors acting in its creation. 2. Not every gifted child becomes an exceptional adult, but most adult talents behaved as talented individuals in their childhood. 3. A gift regulates the activity of a human being. As a characteristic of a personality, a gift is in possession of every human being. It has u continual character in relationship to effectiveness. It may be quantified by this criterion. 4. The qualitative aspect of a gift is based on its structure which conditions the so-called type of talent (it is differentiated in accordance to the classification of human activity) 5. A gift is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Its structure consists of a) a preconditioning constituent (somatic characteristics, abilities, skills, acquirements and competencies); b) an activating constituent (non-specific motivation, will attributes, personality orientation) 6. Creativity is a significant part of both constituents of talent (creative abilities, creative motivation). Insofar as creativity plays a significant and dominant role in the structure of talent, we may speak about creative talent. As mentioned, we understand creativity also as a quality of every human being. A noncreative human being rarely exists (it may be in the most serious cases of olygophreny). Our results also show, that the preschool age is the gate to the world of creativity. 7. The particular components of either constituents of talent possess a hierarchic orderliness that is also related to the type of talent. The most general components of talent - which are involved in every kind of activity - are the intellectual abilities, creative abilities, as well as achievement motivation (a need for self-assertion). On inferior degrees of this hierarchy, there are attributes which specify the respective type of talent. Nevertheless, some attributes may play a general role in the relation to one activity (a type of talent) a special role in relation to another activity (a type of talent). 8. The differentiation of talents begins in a course of the development when the focus of talent is being gradually shifted from its general characteristics onto the special ones. Some common traits, however, remain persevered. 9. In making talent identification and development, it is necessary to intercept all levels of hierarchy that participate in a respective activity. …",

      "abstract": "Promotion of good mental health in young people with and without mental disorders has received little empirical research attention and interventions for improving mental health in young people are not well established. This situation could be explained among other reasons due to the difficulties to define and operationalise what good mental health is. The current manuscript, produced by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Thematic Working Group on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion (ECNP TWG PMD-MHP), presents a critical review of the available operationalizations for good mental health. A pragmatic conceptual operationalisation of good mental health is a much-needed step towards more standardised research in this field. Good mental health can be defined as a state of well-being that allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life and function productively. Universal and selective interventions are suitable to promote mental health. Core domains that define good mental health encompass: (i) mental health literacy, (ii) attitude towards mental disorders, (iii) self-perceptions and values, (iv) cognitive skills, (v) academic/ occupational performance, (vi) emotions, (vii) behaviours, (viii) self-management strategies, (ix) social skills, (x) family and significant relationships (xi) physical health, (xii) sexual health, (xiii) meaning of life, (xiv) and quality of life. These domains should be widely traceable in the literature and can be used to conduct further empirical research in the field of good mental health. Such data can lead to more robust evidence to identify and establish the pathways to follow in order to improve mental health.",

      "title": "Relationship between Academic Support with Academic Burnout among High School Students with The Mediating Role of Quality of Life in School",
      "abstract": "Several key factors affect students’ academic performance. One such important factor is academic burnout which has recently attracted considerable research attention. Burnout is a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal integrity which results from chronic stress, heavy responsibility, time limitation/shortage, and lack of necessary resources and support for performing tasks. It usually occurs in occupations offering human services. Burnout is nowadays considered in academic situations and contexts, leading to being named as ‘academic burnout’. In school context, academic burnout refers to a state of negative feelings, lack of interest in fulfilment of the expected tasks (depersonalization), feelings of exhaustion due to academic expectations and requirements (emotional exhaustion), and finally feelings of inefficiency (ineffectiveness). Burnout could lead to several negative psychological consequences among students including emotional disturbances, negative affects, anxiety, depression, and low self-control. Therefore, it is obvious that academic burnout could have many negative consequences in terms of mental, psychological, and physical well-being. It seems academic support is an important factor which could play a key role in preventing academic burnout among students. The provision of academic support, whether it be direct or indirect, can increase learners’ interest, which can, in turn, significantly improve achievement. Academic support can take a vriety of forms. This can be either emotional, instrumental, or cognitive support. It can also include a combination of all of these different support types. It seems that the level of improvement in echievement can be determined by the kind, level, and the type  of academic supports that are provided. Academic support could be provided from different sources, namely, parents, peers, and teachers, with each playing a distinctive role. These sources transmit values and expectations to students, offer them guidance, feedback, a secure atmosphere to fulfill them, and provide them with emotional support. In addition, the quality of life is a significant environmental factor, which can affect academic burnout. The quality of life at school has received much attention due to its importance in students’ lives. It is defined as students’ objective and subjective well-being as well as their general satisfaction in terms of positive and negative experience resulting from school activities. Forming students’ general perception of welfare, well-being, and their general satisfaction, these positive and negative experiences are the result of students’ involvement in school activities, the amount of happiness experiences, and positive and negative feeling, which show students’ satisfaction with their physical presence, emotional and social relationships, and daily school activities. Research indicates that receiving sufficient social support from family members and friends leads to higher satisfaction among students. Also, some studies have shown that social support could result in decreased emotional exhaustion by developing a desirable perception of the learning environment and academic quality of life. Moreover, appropriate academic support could predict higher social integrity, better academic quality of life, and decreased emotional exhaustion and disinterestedness. All in all, identifying predictive factors of academic burnout and determining their influence on learners’ academic performance are considered highly important for controlling academic burnout in educational psychology. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between academic support and academic burnout by considering the mediating role of quality of life in school among female students. Method: This study was descriptive with a correlational design. The statistical population was all female second-round high school students in 2016 in Qom, Iran. Based on Krejeci and Morgan’s Table, 357 students were selected via stratified random sampling. The data collection instruments included Maslach Burnout Inventory, Sands and Plunkett Academic Support scale, and Ainley and Bourke Quality of life in School Questionnaire. It is noteworthy that the reliability of all the instruments were calculated, and acceptable levels of Cronbach’s alpha were achieved and reported. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics including Pearson Product Moment Correlation, Hierarchical Regression Analysis, and Sobel Z Test. Results: The correlation results indicated that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between academic support and quality of life in school, in one hand, and sub-scales of academic burnout including academic disinterest, emotional exhaustion, ineffectiveness, on the other hand; moreover, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between academic support and quality of life in school. As to Hierarchical Regression Analysis, the results showed academic support can predict academic burnout, and quality of life in school has a mediating role in the relationship between academic support and academic burnout. Discussion & Conclusion: The findings of the present study are in agreement with those of several other studies. This could be justified by considering the fact that any interpersonal relationship between the students and teachers which is indicative of a supportive relationship leads to academic interest among students. Additionally, the more logical expectations parents have from their children and the more academic support they provide, the less lack of interest the students will experience. Moreover, academic support could possibly help students to more successfully cope with their academic stress. Therefore, social support from parents, friends, and teachers prevents academic burnout and protects students against it. Student receiving enough academic support pay close attention to their abilities and competences and do not consider their incompetence and weaknesses as barriers to their success. Increased support from parents, peers, and teachers leads to increased hopefulness, self-efficacy, satisfaction with school, and in turn, increased academic adaptation. On the other hand, students’ quality of life at school is affected and shaped by many factors including family, friends, teachers, scientific and recreational facilities, freedom of speech, free time, values and cultural differences, parenting styles, fairness, self-control, and more importantly, their interactions. Based on the findings, it should be noted that the quality of life at school could predict students’ academic burnout and be affected by difficult and irrelevant tasks and activities, limited recreation, and lack of control and academic support. Consequently, this can lead to an increase in negative feelings and a decrease in abnormal behaviors, unusual absences, and mental and physical health. Accordingly, different forms of academic support like efficient teaching, fulfilling needs, and holding happy classes could lead to improvements in quality of life at school and generally decreases in students’ academic burnout. Overall, the findings imply that academic support has a preventive role in developing academic burnout; furthermore, careful planning and effective interventions should be performed to enhance students’ quality of life and their academic guidance.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the neuropsychology of problem solving. Problem solving encompasses a vast range of normal cognitive activity. At its most basic, the ability to problem solving requires the modulation and control of more fundamental or routine cognitive skills. The right skill has to be harnessed at the right time and changing between skills has to be flexible. Psychologists distinguish between two main ways in which the organization of cognitive skills is controlled: (1) habitual routines and (2) novel reorganization. Habitual well-established routines, such as the series of acts required to get from home to work in the morning, are thought to be established in memory. Like a computer program, the various component skills can be called up as and when the time is appropriate. This type of skill organization is not strictly problem solving. Problem solving comes into play when nonhabitual or novel patterns of behavior are initiated that require the reorganization of sets of established cognitive skills. The chapter discusses the following different aspects of problem solving: (1) focused attention, (2) higher-order inferences, (3) formulation of strategies, (4) flexibility, and (5) evaluation of the outcome.",

      "title": "The aging mind: A complex challenge for research and practice",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline as part of mental ageing is typically assessed with standardized tests; below-average performance in such tests is used as an indicator for pathological cognitive aging. In addition, morphological and functional changes in the brain are used as parameters for age-related pathological decline in cognitive abilities. However, there is no simple link between the trajectories of changes in cognition and morphological or functional changes in the brain. Furthermore, below-average test performance does not necessarily mean a significant impairment in everyday activities. It therefore appears crucial to record individual everyday tasks and their cognitive (and other) requirements in functional terms. This would also allow reliable assessment of the ecological validity of existing and insufficient cognitive skills. Understanding and dealing with the phenomena and consequences of mental aging does of course not only depend on cognition. Motivation and emotions as well personal meaning of life and life satisfaction play an equally important role. This means, however, that cognition represents only one, albeit important, aspect of mental aging. Furthermore, creating and development of proper assessment tools for functional cognition is important. In this contribution we would like to discuss some aspects that we consider relevant for a holistic view of the aging mind and promote a strengthening of a multidisciplinary approach with close cooperation between all basic and applied sciences involved in aging research, a quick translation of the research results into practice, and a close cooperation between all disciplines and professions who advise and support older people.",

Les conflits interpersonnels sont egalement au cœur du processus suicidaire et les changements cognitifs lies a l’âge pourraient contribuer a des defauts dans la prise de decision sociale complexe. Objectif : mettre en evidence des perturbations dans la cognition sociale qui pourraient representer des marqueurs de vulnerabilite aux conduites suicidaires, et confirmer les anomalies retrouvees chez le sujet jeune pour d’autres fonctions cognitives.

The major cognitive processes in problem solving are representing, planning, executing, and monitoring. The major kinds of knowledge required for problem solving are facts, concepts, procedures, strategies, and beliefs. The theoretical approaches that have developed over the history of research on problem are associationism, Gestalt, and information processing. Each of these approaches involves fundamental issues in problem solving such as the nature of transfer, insight, and goal-directed heuristics, respectively. Some current research topics in problem solving include decision making, intelligence and creativity, teaching of thinking skills, expert problem solving, analogical reasoning, mathematical and scientific thinking, everyday thinking, and the cognitive neuroscience of problem solving.

      "title": "Clinical Perspectives on Play",
      "abstract": "Play is recognized as a distinct and valid treatment modality that facilitates adaptive functioning in a variety of areas, such as social, emotional, cognitive, and personality development. Psychologists who have observed the play behaviors of children with emotional disabilities, however, have challenged many of these commonly accepted defining characteristics of play. Play skills are similar to social and cognitive skills, in that they follow a fairly specific normative pattern of development that moves along a continuum ranging from basic to very complex actions. Therapists who employ psychological treatment interventions use a number of theories that provide frameworks from which they may develop strategies, techniques, goals, and progress evaluations. Cognitive-behavior therapy is derived from behavior and cognitive therapies, which developed separately before being united. The central objective of the majority of group play activities, which include role-playing, structured games, and collaborative art work, is to assist members in developing age-appropriate interpersonal skills.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social cognition refers to the brain mechanisms by which we process social information about other humans and ourselves. Alterations in interpersonal and social functioning are common in major depressive disorder, though only poorly addressed by current pharmacotherapies. Further standardized tests, such as depression ratings or neuropsychologic tests, used in routine practice provide very little information on social skills, schemas, attributions, stereotypes and judgments related to social interactions. In this article, we review recent literature on how healthy human brains process social decisions and how these processes are altered in major depressive disorder. We especially focus on interactive paradigms (e.g., game theory based tasks) that can reproduce daily life situations in laboratory settings. The evidences we review, together with the rich literature on the protective role of social networks in handling stress, have implications for developing more ecologically-valid biomarkers and interventions in order to optimize functional recovery in depressive disorders.",

Emotional intelligence represents the ability to perceive, appraise, and express emotion accurately and adaptively; the ability to understand emotion and emotional knowledge; the ability to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate cognitive activities and adaptive action; and the ability to regulate emotions in oneself and others (Mayer &amp; Salovey, 1997). In other words, emotional intelligence refers to the ability to process emotion-laden information competently and to use it to guide cognitive activities like problem solving and to focus energy on required behaviors. The term suggested to some that there might be other ways of being intelligent than those emphasized by standard IQ tests, that one might be able to develop these abilities, and that an emotional intelligence could be an important predictor of success in personal relationships, family functioning, and the workplace.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the peculiarities of the formation and development of professionally important qualities of civil defense specialists at higher education institutions. Different approaches to the definition of the concept of «professionally important qualities» are analyzed, according to which the concept is considered as biologically determined (physiological, psychological, innate abilities and inclinations), individual and psychological properties of a personality as a specialist as well as personal properties formed and developed in the process of training and professional activities. The author considers some classifications of professionally important qualities of a civil defense specialist. For any type of professional activity, such professionally important qualities as discipline, responsibility, accuracy, attentiveness, observation, sensitivity, punctuality, restraint, ingenuity, ability to self-control and professional self-assessment of one's own states and actions, purposefulness, developed visual and figurative memory and analytical thinking are relevant. Risky professions require physical endurance, coordination of movements, dexterity, ability to tolerate heavy physical loads and high temperatures, determination and courage, mental and emotional stability, risk-taking, ability to switch, distribute, concentrate and hold attention, react quickly to the situation and make independent decisions and act in extreme conditions, a sense of duty, etc. The following groups of professionally important qualities for civil defense specialists are identified and substantiated: psychophysiological, intellectual, emotional and volitional, moral and ethical, managerial and communicative. The possibilities of their formation and development in the process of cadets' professional training at a higher education institution are considered.",

      "title": "Aprendizaje autorregulado. Factores subjetivos, conductuales y del contexto. Cartografía conceptual, parte III",
      "abstract": "In recent decades, self-regulated learning (SRL) has been a growing and fruitful field of research in educational psychology. According to an initial review of the literature, the construct, since its early appearances with a meaning similar to the current one, has been the subject of a growing number of investigations. The construct has evolved towards increasingly comprehensive conceptions, comprising cognitive, metacognitive, affective/motivational processes, as well as behaviors aimed at controlling these and environmental factors. Likewise, the construct has been differentiated from other related concepts, such as metacognition, autonomous learning, strategic learning, self-directed learning, and independent learning. Part of the current understanding of the concept is that SRL is logically subordinate to intentional learning and self-regulation, being that it is a particular case of these: only intentional learning is self-regulated, and self-regulation can fall on processes other than learning, like the emotional ones. A previous review of the literature has determined that the processes that constitute the SRL can: a) be executed before, during, and after the learning task; b) fall on cognition, motivation, affections, own behavior and the context; c) occur at a general or macro level and at the level of a specific task. On the construct, in the literature there is a variety of theoretical models, with common and complementary aspects. Most of these models conceive the construct from a complex perspective, including a variety of subjective and behavioral aspects, as well as its interaction with environmental factors. For example, there is the cyclical model (Pintrich, 2004; Zimmerman, 2013), the layer model of Boekaers (2017), the dual processing model by the same author (Boekaerts, 2011), the COPES model (conditions, operations, products, evaluation, and standards) of Winne (2017), the Metacognitive and Affective Model of Self-Regulated Learning, by Efklides (2011), and the socially shared regulation of learning by Hadwin et al. (2018). However, the complexity of the construct and its relationships with others and with external factors is not exhaustively included in any of the models. Based on this progress and this limitation of the research on the SRL, the purpose of the investigation was to analyze the theoretical, contextual, and methodological dimensions of the SRL, just as the specialized literature has addressed this construct. The inquiry consisted of a qualitative content analysis of current and relevant academic documents, using the technique of conceptual mapping. This technique, as proposed by Sergio Tobón (2013), is based on complex thinking and is made up of eight analytical axes: Notion, Categorization, Characterization, Differentiation, Classification, Linking, Methodology, and Exemplification. To this set of axes, the author of this article added a ninth axes ‒Causation‒, aimed at analyzing the causal relationships in which the SRL participates. The article presents the results in two of the nine axes of the technique: causation and linkage. The results lead to: a) identify and describe the reciprocal influences between the SRL construct and a set of subjective variables (such as self-concept, task perception, motivation, and self-efficacy), behavioral (such as learning strategies, volitional control, and setting of the environment) and contextual (such as the type and difficulty of the task, teaching strategies); b) identify and describe the links of the SRL topic with a set of theoretical topics (such as epistemology and the learning approach), curricular topics (such as competency-based education) and social topics (such as sustainable social development). The article concludes that the SRL is in a complex network of recursive relationships, which gives empirical support to comprehensive theoretical proposals on the construct, the sociocognitive approach to learning and the relational epistemological approach, and shows the relevance of the SRL theme in the competency-based education and the promotion of sustainable social development.",

However, while existing metrics of mental health typically emphasize ill health, existing metrics of wellbeing typically focus on happiness or life satisfaction, indirectly infer wellbeing from a selection of social and economic factors, or do not reflect a read out of the full spectrum of mental functioning that impacts people's everyday life and that spans the continuum from distress and the inability to function, through to the ability to function to one's full potential.",

      "title": "An Investigation of Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction and Its Basic Components: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Basic psychological needs satisfaction is closely related to self-determination theory, which is associated with desires that influence motivation and individuals’ actions. According to self-determination theory, when individuals have both extrinsically motivated and intrinsically motivated motivation while pursuing a task, positive outcomes such as task continuation and subjective well-being occur. Within the framework of self-determination theory, individuals’ motivating needs may be thought of as their psychological nourishment, and the perception of being able to do things and meet their needs in their personal space may be highlighted. Among the basic elements of basic psychological needs satisfaction, autonomy, competence, relatedness, and the potential for life satisfaction related to these three components may be counted. Competence is associated with individuals’ effectiveness in interacting with the environment and their sense of control in being able to accomplish tasks (such as completing a project assignment). Autonomy, on the other hand, is related to the individuals’ ability to regulate their actions voluntarily. Relatedness with others, which is another component of basic psychological needs satisfaction, may arise from individuals’ desire to be in relationships characterized by mutual respect, trust, and emotional connections with others. When looking at the elements associated with basic psychological needs satisfaction in the literature, “Maslow's hierarchy of needs,” “Psychological well-being,” “Disasters,” and “Various motivational sources” may be seen. Considering the elements associated with basic psychological needs satisfaction, it is suggested that activities may be organized on how to benefit from that. For example, an activity may be organized to develop awareness of the components of autonomy, competence, and interpersonal relationships involved in satisfying basic psychological needs.",

      "title": "Self-Efficacy",
      "abstract": "Self-efficacy refers to an individual’s perception of his or her capacity to perform a specific task. Albert Bandura is credited with recognizing the importance of self-efficacy in human agency. He clarified that self-efficacy is the belief in one’s capabilities to mobilize personal resources, such as motivation, cognitive, and behavioral skills, in order to orchestrate task-specific performance. Theoretically and empirically, self-efficacy has been shown to have wide-ranging implications for organizational behavior. Much evidence supports its importance in human agency and its interaction with variables involved in cognitive self-regulation (goal setting, feedback, etc.). Self-efficacy also has been validated as making an impact on learning and performance applications, such as training, leadership, decision making, and creativity. In addition, scholars have found that self-efficacy predicts differential behaviors in a number of job situations. To date, the most important of these are work stress and strain, unemployment and job seeking, employee citizenship and extra-role behaviors, employee attitudes, commitment and adaptability to change, newcomer socialization, and entrepreneurial behavior. Importantly, self-efficacy measures must be adapted to the specific task under investigation. Self-report tools are used to address perceptions of capability across a range of performance outcomes. Guided by Bandura’s work, some scholars differentiate self-efficacy “magnitude” from self-efficacy “strength” and self-efficacy “generality.” Magnitude refers to a comparative level of performance (e.g., whether one believes she can produce one, two, or three publications next year), while strength refers to one’s confidence (e.g., probability) in achieving at that level. Less commonly measured, generality refers to the application of efficacy beliefs across situations. Because self-efficacy is task-specific, care must be taken in scholarly research to understand the dynamics of the task involved in the evaluation; for instance, different types of tasks require different skills and motivations. For the same reason, caution is needed when generalizing empirical findings to new tasks. However, this limitation also illustrates how potent the construct of self-efficacy is, given the vast body of evidence showing its predictive validity in organizational behavior. In addition, constructs derivative of self-efficacy have evolved to address group situations. These refer to group efficacy, team efficacy, or collective efficacy, and have been measured using both single ratings of team consensus and averages of individual ratings. The potency of self-efficacy also has relevance to a popular dispositional construct: core self-evaluations. Findings from studies of group efficacy and core self-evaluations generally support the predictive validity of these broader measures, although the predictive path may operate through self-efficacy.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents several assistive technology solutions that may be used to help people with moderate to severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities reach relevant goals such as strengthening object-manipulation and ambulation responses and carrying out multistep tasks. For each of the technology solutions, the paper examines (a) the specific function (i.e. the way it helps people achieve the goal targeted) and (b) the possible role over time (i.e. whether it might serve as a temporary or permanent form of support). The basic functions of the assistive technology solutions presented entail: increasing people's motivation, supplementing people's cognition (working memory), and bridging the gap between people's motor, sensory/orientation, and verbal functioning and the functioning level required to achieve the goals targeted. Based on the knowledge available to date, the role of the technology solutions over time may be considered: (a) modifiable, with the possibility of reducing or even completely fading out the use of such solutions, when their function is to increase people's motivation or support people's cognitive/memory performance, and (b) practically unalterable when their function is to bridge the gap between people's limited sensory, motor, and verbal skills and the skill level required to reach a relevant goal.",

Situations or episodes of these types can also cause both physical and mental problems, such as fatigue, irritability, lack of concentration, unhappiness, depressive sensation, depersonalization, and emotional exhaustion. Despite all of these challenges, resilience enables nurses to cope with their work environment and to maintain healthy and stable psychological functioning. The aim of this review is to describe the concept of resilience, explain characteristics with which it is related and outline interventions to increase the resilience of nurses.",

      "title": "Social-Emotional Development and Aggression",
      "abstract": "Social-emotional responding is an essential element of human development necessary for promoting other-oriented behaviors and healthy interpersonal functioning. Social-emotional development refers to children's increasing awareness and comprehension of their own and others' emotional experiences, as well as the regulation of their emotions and their ability to employ these skills in ways that are normative for their age and appropriate for the social situation. One model of social-emotional development isolates three core components: other-oriented emotions (e.g., sympathy), which result from the affective understanding of another person's state; self-conscious emotions (e.g., guilt), which result from an evaluation of the self in relation to others; and self-regulation (e.g., emotion regulation), which involves exerting control over one's emotions, physiology, or behavior. Deficits in sympathy, guilt, and emotion regulation have all been implicated in children's tendencies toward aggression. Sympathy, or concern for others, is theorized to inhibit aggressive responding by highlighting the negative consequences experienced by victims of aggression. In contrast, guilt is a negative emotional response to one's own wrongdoing, and may inhibit aggression in two ways: the anticipation of guilt may prevent the aggressive act altogether or the experience of guilt in response to behaving aggressively may reduce the likelihood of recommitting a similar act. And finally, emotion regulation may allow children to manage their levels of negative affect in order to prevent impulsive aggressive responses and optimize conditions for prosocial responses. With this in mind, understanding the healthy development of these three components of social-emotional responding is crucial to inhibiting aggression in children and adolescents.",

Furthermore, these biases have been found in different areas of society (legal, economic, education, etc.) whose impact on the decision-making process is important. Often these biases help us make quick and appropriate decisions, but other times they lead to erroneous decisions. Within the cognitive biases due to inadequate processing of information, there are three main groups: perceptional bias, attentional bias, and memory bias. This chapter explains these three groups of cognitive biases. Subsequently, it offers a detailed explanation of some of the cognitive biases that have been studied in the fields of cognitive psychology. Finally, the author creates an alphabetical list of these biases and brief definitions.",

Intelligence is general capacity of a human being that consciously adjust his thinking to new requirements. It is a general mental adoption to new difficulties and conditions of life.Emotion is an experience that convoys generalized inner adjustment and mental, physiological moved up states of the individual, and that shows itself in his overall behaviour. Intelligence is the ability to learn and deal with abstraction. Intelligence is the skill or power of making a suitable response to certain stimuli in a given situation.This is a study carried out to find the relationship of Emotional Intelligence with regard to the professional and personal life. This is a study carried out among executives across the industries, who work under lots of pressure and where performance becomes the criteria for the advancement in their life due to competition. Emotional Intelligence can be an inoculation that preserves health and encourages growth. Emotional intelligence includes the exercise mastery over your own emotions and behavior and respond appropriately in various life situations.",

Dari permasalahan tersebut penting untuk dilakukan proses pengambilan keputusan untuk dapat memahami sisi psikologis dari penyandang lupus yang memilih tetap bekerja meskipun mengalami banyak masalah dan keterbatasan fisik. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan fenomenologi. Penentuan kriteria partisipan dilakukan dengan teknik purposive sampling. Penggalian data sendiri dilakukan melalui wawancara mendalam (in depth interview) terhadap partisipan. Data yang telah didapatkan kemudian diolah menggunakan teknik inductive thematic analysis. Validitas yang digunakan adalah validitas komunikatif dan argumentatif, juga krosecek data yang dilakukan melalui informasi yang diberikan oleh significant other. Hasil penelitian menjelaskan permasalahan yang dialami seperti kondisi tubuh, atau dari keluarga dan tempat kerja tidak membuat penyandang lupus memilih berhenti bekerja. Pilihan keputusan tetap bekerja justru membuat penyandang lupus semakin dapat mengurangi permasalahan yang dialami. Keputusan yang dipilih kemudian diimplikasikan dengan baik melalui komitmen terhadap organisasi sebagai bentuk tanggung jawab kepada diri sendiri maupun kepada pihak perusahaan.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the results of a review of studies of psychology that describe how ordinary human reasoning may lead patients to provide an unreliable history of present illness. Patients make errors because of mistakes in comprehension, recall, evaluation and expression. Comprehension of a question changes depending on ambiguities in the language used and conversational norms. Recall fails through the forgetting of relevant information and through automatic shortcuts to memory. Evaluation can be mistaken because of shifting social comparisons and faulty personal beliefs. Expression is influenced by moods and ignoble failures. We suggest that an awareness of how people report current symptoms and events is an important clinical skill that can be enhanced by knowledge of selected studies in psychology. These insights might help clinicians avoid mistakes when eliciting a patient's history of present illness.",

      "abstract": "Creativity is one of the cognitive skills required by performance in the 21st century. In the current society which is fully technological and tends to automatize everything, no one can deny the importance of creativity as necessary and useful attribute of knowledge. However, there are different ways of approaching it due to its features that are like a magical aspect of thinking (Sparks, 2011, p. 3).[1] Studies have highlighted that there is mutual determination between creativity as specific, innovative and emotional intelligence. A person is considered creative if s/he can produce original, innovative, unique ideas or products. Creative thinking allows a person to explore different aspects of life in completely different ways than the common way of thinking. A manner of analysing the creative phenomenon is to observe creative personalities, to identify the cognitive characteristics that are different from the others such as creative strategies, cognitive styles, resolving strategies, overwhelming imagination, inspiration, intuition and other elements (Piirto, 2011). Rational mind is the one that confers understanding and reflection along with emotional experiences that put their mark on human personality and thinking. Creativity is a skill that can be developed in schools, if it is identified and proper strategies are used such as engaging the individual in his/her own development with all the abilities along with presenting all opportunities for social evolution.(Glassner & Schwarz, 2007)[2].[1] S.

It may be used as a political tool, as a method of exercising control over others, at either the individual, family or societal level, or as a method of self-harm, and occasionally it indicates possible mental illness. This article examines the motivation behind hunger strikes in prisoners. It describes the psychiatrist's role in assessment and management of prisoners by referring to case examples. The paper discusses the assessment of an individual's competence to commit suicide by starvation, legal restraints to intervention, practical difficulties and associated ethical dilemmas. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most prisoners who refuse food are motivated by the desire to achieve an end rather than killing themselves, and that hunger-strike secondary to mental illness is uncommon. Although rarely required, the psychiatrist may have an important contribution to make in the management of practical and ethical difficulties.",

Psychologists turned, therefore, to the experimental techniques developed in the study of perception, attention, learning and memory, and applied these to the problem of ageing. The researcher tries to isolate and identify the effects of normal ageing on cognitive abilities. Changes caused by the ageing process are confounded with associated changes in physical health, in life-style, in motivation and personality. One problem that arises when complex tasks are studied is that of distinguishing between age differences in strategy and in capacity. When a capacity limitation is the cause, the age difference can only be removed by restructuring the task so as to make it less demanding. The current trend in ageing research is to study performance in real-world situations with emphasis on the practical and applied aspects.",

The interdependencies, uncertainties and conflicting priorities create ‘wicked problems.’ Complex situations trigger differing viewpoints and can prompt an emotional response, particularly if current assumptions, values and principles are challenged. In such scenarios, the application of superordinate principles can help resolve issues by establishing a shared perspective.

We then present a model of intellectual development involving four cycles - episodic, realistic representation-based, rule-based, and principle-based thought - and summarize several studies showing how the processes involved in g interact in each cycle. We then present research aiming to increase intelligence. Finally, we discuss the implications of this theory for psychometric, cognitive, and developmental science and show how it solves long-standing theoretical and practical problems not solved by other theories, such as the decreasing likelihood of attaining high intelligence, the differentiation of abilities with development, and the training fade-out problem.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Despite evidence showing that cognitive biases – the systematic errors made by humans during cognitive processing, are prevalent among decision-makers, there is a lack of theoretical models providing insight into how these limitations of human mind might affect decisions made during performance management. This study aims to fill this gap and contribute to performance management scholarship by proposing a conceptual framework broadening our understanding of the role of cognitive biases in performance improvements practices and by highlighting remedies for cognitive biases. Design/methodology/approach Using benchmarking as an example, the authors integrate the knowledge from performance management and cognitive psychology literature. Examples of cognitive biases possible during benchmarking are used to illustrate how the limitations of human mind might have a critical role in performance management. Findings The cognitive biases might diminish the positive effect of performance improvement practice on organizational performance. As there is a prevalence of cognitive biases coupled with the inability of individuals to recognize and face them, the remedy for cognitive biases should be sought not at an individual but rather on an organizational level, in creating organizational cognitive biases policy (CBP). Originality/value The presented model provides new insights into the role of cognitive biases in performance management and allows seeing CBP as a safeguard against the effects of cognitive biases on performance. By referring to cognitive biases and CBP, our model also helps to understand why the same performance improvement practices might incite different opinions among decision-makers.",

      "title": "Analysing self-regulation:Its cognitive and emotional foundations and links with social understanding in early child development",
      "abstract": "Self-regulation is the term referring to a set of abilities that we employ in order to engage in everyday activities. Yet its operational definition is difficult, since it involves several component skills, like the inhibition of prepotent responses and a need to control emotions. These skills each show rapid development in the preschool period and this thesis explores how the regulatory processes in cognitive and emotional domains unfolds. I start with a conceptualization of cognitive and emotional regulation, suggesting that the literature is beset with problems of differential labelling and measurement. For example, ‘Inhibitory Control’ (IC) has been claimed as unitary by some but involves two processes –Conflict and Delay – by others. The bridge between cognitive-regulation (CR) emotion-regulation (ER) has been less well researched and it stretches our conception of the link between regulation of thought, behaviour, and feelings. The assessment of emotionality has been approached from various angles such as the discrepancy between the control of positive or negative emotions and comprehension of emotionality. In 5 studies (with 421 children in total), I tested the association between cognitive and emotional processes in the development of self-regulation. A grasp of mental states and emotions was found to be associated with the regulation processes in both domains. The final three experiments attempt to explain the effect of ‘understanding’ over the ability of control in both domains. The direct observations of ER, which evokes both positive and negative emotionality, revealed inconsistent findings in terms of the associations that ER shared with IC. In contrast, an understanding of emotionality (EU) as found to relate consistently to conflict-inhibition and mental-state understanding. A scale was developed to cover the middle ground between ER and EU and is called SURE (a Scale of Understanding of Regulation of Emotions). Studies 4 and 5, which employed this measure, showed that the children were able to make prospective attributions of ER for story characters starting from the age of four. Children’s performance in this task was related to the control over their behaviour in rule-based situations (e.g. conflict-inhibition tasks). To observe children’s control of emotionality, a novel measure was developed to assess their internalization of the necessity of control in a cognitively demanding task, which focuses on emotional changes. It is suggested that future research should investigate different forms of understanding of emotions and cognitive processes in more detail.",

      "abstract": "As AI decision-making plays an increasing role in our daily lives, and makes more and more important contributions to how we manage our most vital interests, the question of to what extent algorithms can be made sensitive to the full scope of our moral concerns is of ever greater concern. My proposal is that we can identify a scale along which we can place the suitability of an AI system for virtue judgments, meaning appropriately evaluating instances of virtue (or vice). To do so, I harness the notion of a developmental pathway, where virtue theorists describe the acquisition of virtue as a task involving movement along a number of stages of increasing sensitivity to and autonomous control over the facets that go into virtuous action. This prominently includes not just behavioral capacities (i.e. a carpenter building a table, an AI succeeding at a sorting task) but also psychological capacities, such as perception, imagination, foresight, and so on. We need to have multiple levels of evaluation in order to make sense of virtue judgments: that of how the action in question fares in this particular case, and how the disposition that this action is an instance of fares in the larger context of the agent’s life. We need appropriate interpretation of the subject matter of our judgments (not just as arrays of formal symbols, but mapped onto tangible situations) in order to appropriately judge the relationship between an individual action and the disposition which it is an instance of, since we need a sensible understanding of how having concrete disposition of character is of substantial import on concrete actions of the respective kind, something that involves more than formal relationships but rather an appreciation of the referents of the numbers and relations that go into machine learning.",

Combining the two approaches has an even greater impact on both social-emotional and cognitive achievements than either one on its own. Interventions that focus only on motivation or only on cognitive-metacognitive competencies are more effective than traditional instruction, but less effective than focusing on both motivation and metacognition.",

      "abstract": "Emotional intelligence, though captivating, faces challenges due to the lack of a unified definition and measurable aspects. This ambiguity hinders research and development of interventions. This chapter explores these complexities. Current models like Goleman's, emphasizing social skills and self-awareness, and Mayer and Salovey's, focusing on cognitive processes, exemplify the variation. Each model has strengths and weaknesses, highlighting the need for a more cohesive approach. Measuring EI is another hurdle. Self-report measures face social desirability bias, while observer ratings lack objectivity. Performance-based assessments offer promise, but may not generalize to real-world situations. A multi-method approach that combines these methods is recommended. Cultural variations further complicate the picture. Emotional expression and expectations differ significantly, making existing models potentially biased. Culturally sensitive measures and interventions are crucial.",

Students need to attain 21st century skills like problem-solving, creativity, innovation, meta-cognition, communication etc. to endure in the modern world. Problem-solving skill is one of the fundamental human cognitive processes. Whenever students face a situation where they do not know the way to complete a task, the problem occurs. Problem-solving is a process, which involves systematic observation and critical thinking to find an appropriate solution or way to reach the desired goal. The framework of problem-solving consisted of two major skills: observation and critical thinking skill. Observation skill refers to collecting data, understanding and interpreting the meaning of the information using all the senses. Critical thinking involves the individual’s ability to do the following: conceptualizing, logical reasoning, applying strategy, analytical thinking, decision making and synthesizing to solve any problem.",

Personal competencies, like self-awareness, self-regulation and motivation, determine how we manage ourselves. Social competencies, such as empathy and social skills, determine how well we handle relationships. Sensing what others feel without their saying so captures the essence of empathy. Social skills would include influence, communication, conflict management, leadership, building bonds, collaboration, co-operation and team work. At the very least, empathy requires being able to read another's emotions. At a higher level, it entails sensing and responding to a person's unspoken concerns or feelings. And at the highest levels, empathy is about understanding the issues or concerns that lie behind another's feelings. Unless we have self-awareness, it will be difficult to be conscious of others ’emotional terrain.",

      "title": "La flexibilidad psicológica como herramienta de adaptación a los nuevos retos laborales. Empoderamiento, innovación y compromiso como palancas para hacer frente a un entorno vuca",
      "abstract": "a presente investigacion aborda los retos a los que se enfrenta la gestion de personas en la actualidad. Estos retos se resumen en que los trabajadores se encuentran superados por la complejidad, tienen crecientes problemas de salud derivados del trabajo, tienen tambien dificultades para adaptarse a los cambios del entorno y sus niveles de compromiso, quiza derivado de todo lo anterior, son muy bajos. Las organizaciones estan llevando a cabo numerosas iniciativas para hacer frente a estos retos. Estas iniciativas van desde el aplanamiento de estructuras organizativas hasta la generalizacion de practicas como el mindfulness o el coaching pasando por mejorar la experiencia de empleado o potenciar las organizaciones saludables, pero todo esto no parece ser suficiente. Este trabajo identifica la Flexibilidad Psicologica (FP), proveniente de la terapia cognitivo conductual denominada de Aceptacion y Compromiso (ACT) como posible recurso que ayude a los trabajadores y, por tanto, a las organizaciones, a hacer frente a los retos planteados. La FP es la capacidad que tiene una persona de gestionar su mundo interior de tal forma que pueda dirigirse hacia lo que de verdad le importa, sus valores. La investigacion, con una muestra de 3.697 sujetos, profundiza en la relacion que existe entre la FP en el trabajo y las variables identificadas como clave para hacer frente a los mencionados retos. Estas variables son el Empoderamiento Psicologico, la Propension a la Innovacion y el Compromiso. Se concluye que, en efecto, existe una relacion directa y positiva entre la FP y estas variables, iluminando el camino hacia un nuevo recurso que ayude a trabajadores y empresas a hacer frente a los retos del entorno actual.\n The investigation deals with the challenges of Human Resources management nowadays. Four of them have been indentified as key ones: the employees are overcome by complexity, they have health problems associated with their jobs, they have considerable difficulties to catch up with the changes of the environment and, (probably due to the above), they show lack of commintment to work. Companies are taking many actions to face these challenges, such as: flattening of organizational structures, introducing mindfulness and coaching, improving the employees´ experience and encouraging health-promoting initiatives. Yet, all these efforts and many others seem not to be enough. This work identifies the Psychological Flexibility (PF), which comes from a behaviorist-cognitive therapy named Action and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a potential resource which may help employees and organizations to deal with all the challenges mentioned above. The PF is the capacity of a person to manage one’s internal world in a way that one can address directly what is important for him/her (the personal values). The investigation, with a sample of 3.697 subjects, analyses the relations between the PF at work and the variables identified as key ones for the management of the current challenges. These variables are the Psychological Empowerment, the Propensity to Innovate and the Engagment. As a conclusion, we can say that there is a direct and positive relationship between the PF and these other variables, which illuminates the path towards a new resource that may help employees and companies to face the challenges in the environment at present.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The papers in this Special Issue compellingly show that older adults' everyday cognitive life is governed not by the decline in elementary cognitive processes as measured in the lab, but by a multitude of compensatory mechanisms, most of which are of the social/motivational variety. Much of this compensatory behavior can be elicited with no or only little experimental prodding, underscoring the self-organizing or self-initiated nature of this type of behavior, even in advanced old age. We suggest that the study of compensation and the orchestration of cognitive, social, and motivational compensatory mechanisms in effective and healthy aging provides a meaningful challenge to traditional ways of examining developmental changes in cognitive performance.",

Each activity of the exercise program has been devised so that one or two cognitive elements are strongly addressed. In this way, this program could be used in helping students considering their individual needs and contexts. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the proposed creativity cognitive element exercise program could be useful in design creativity education.",

The question how psychedelics induce this state of enhanced flexible thinking remains to be answered and investigating the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon will not only help in understanding why psychedelics are of use in the therapeutic setting but also in other settings where flexible thinking is challenged. A model including neuronal networks, neurotransmitters and personal factors playing a role in this process will be proposed which can be put to the test by means of placebo-controlled pharmaco-imaging studies in healthy volunteers.",

The occupational therapy process (assess–plan– act–evaluate) is iteractive, moving through multiple cycles of problem identification and solution generation with a key focus on occupation and the occupational human in context.

      "title": "A comparison of stress, coping, empathy, and personality factors among post-graduate students of behavioural science and engineering courses",
      "abstract": "To the editor, A great deal of stress is common among students pursuing professional training in behavioral science and engineering. They often face stress associated with education, interpersonal relationships, workloads, financial difficulties, emotions, physical health, family, academics, jobs, and careers. Stress perception is influenced by personality traits. A person's perception of stress and their ability to cope with its negative effects are complex processes involving both interpersonal and intrapersonal factors. Stress affects students across all disciplines, but students who employ positive coping mechanisms are more likely to succeed academically.[1-4] Coping and stress are strongly associated with empathy. Empathic self-efficacy is positively correlated with adaptive coping strategies, while it is negatively correlated with maladaptive ones. An empathic person is likely to have better interpersonal skills, as well as a natural tendency to comfort others. Professionals in the mental health field, especially those who provide care, need empathy to understand their clients' problems and provide effective care.[1-3] In non-clinical professions such as engineering, empathy also comes into play, as it promotes intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, helps in multidisciplinary environments, and helps facilitate healthy relationships between staff, administrators, and other stakeholders. Engineers are more autonomous, independent, dominant, oriented to their jobs, less inclined to social issues, tough-minded, and low in extraversion according to studies of personality characteristics.[4-7] Our study examined the impact of personality characteristics and empathy on stress perception and coping of 80 postgraduate students in mental health and engineering disciplines [MPhil students (Clinical Psychology and Psychiatric Social Work) and MTech students (Engineering Disciplines)]. Measures like the 16 Personality Factor Test, Toronto Empathy Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced (COPE) were used for data collection.[8-11] In this study, we noted significant differences between the postgraduate students of these two disciplines in three areas of the 16 PF Test, viz., E (Dominance), L (Vigilance), and Q2 (Self-Reliance). Engineering professionals tend to be dominating, autonomy-seeking, and tough-minded.[3,6,7,12] Engineering postgraduates scored significantly higher in all these three areas of 16 PF. We observed \"perfectionism\" is a strong predictor of stress perception among postgraduate students of behavioral sciences, while, emotional stability is a strong predictor of stress perception among engineering postgraduates [Table 1]. Emotional stability and empathy are predictors of perceived stress in postgraduate students of either discipline. Empathy and emotional stability were both found to be significant predictors of perceived stress. Stress would be perceived differently by students with higher emotional stability and empathy. Empathy is a key component of every profession, including engineering. In the healthcare field, empathy plays a key role, since professionals with high levels of empathy do a better job with their clients.[1-5]Table 1: Personality Factors (scores in 16 PF Personality Factor Test) between the postgraduate students of mental health and the postgraduate students of engineering (n=80)Ethical clearance Ethical approval of this study has been received from the Ethical Committee of the Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India.

      "abstract": "Gifted children may perform worse or achieve much less than expected: how can this happen and how can such underachievement be prevented? To answer this question it is theorized that personal variables (e.g. identity, cognitive and motivational factors) and environmental variables (e.g. home and school) influence or interact with each other. The environmental variables may occur at different levels, e.g., the individual level or the group level Mutual influences or interactions between variables at different levels can be integrated within an interactional multilevel theory. A first example of such a theory is constructed with the aid of four consecutive developmental models. With a child's increasing age the number of variables in a model increases because of the child's growth in cognitive complexity and the accumulating differentiation in meaningful environmental levels and situations. With these models it is possible to explain a gifted child's underachievement in certain situations and its simultaneous high achievement in others. It is also possible to predict that by changing certain environmental characteristics underachievement can be turned into high achievement.",

      "title": "Self-Esteem and Collective Self-Esteem as Predictors of Depression",
      "abstract": "Self-esteem is a term that reflects a person's overall evaluation or appraisal of her or his own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs (for example, I am competent, I am worthy) and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame. Self-esteem is a confidence in onself, a satisfaction of what one is and the self-respect that confidence brings. It is the appraisal or assessment of a person on one's self worth. It encompasses belief about one's capacity and worthiness. Self-esteem is a complex phenomena consisting of three components- competence,worthiness, self-evaluation. Competence means self-esteem is tied to and reflected in a particular class of behavior, namely behavior that is effective or successful. It has been found that there is negative relationship between self-esteem and anxiety (Pyszczynski et al., 2004). Moreover, individuals with high self-esteem and low anxiety are more inclined to engage in mastery behaviors. Low level of self-esteem has been linked to behavioral problems and poor school performance (Agarwala & Raj, 2003). It is related with serious issues such as teenage pregnancy (Crockenberg & Soby, 1994), suicides (Choquet, Koves & Poutignat, 2000; Bhattacharjee & Deb, 2007; NCRB, 2007) and maladjustment.Luhtanen & Crocker (1992) emphasized the importance of collective self-esteem. Collective self-esteem refers to the feelings and evaluations of the worthiness of a social group-such as racial, ethinic, or work group of which one is a member (Coming, 2002; Jetten, Branscombe & Spears, 2002; Rahimi & Fisher, 2002). DeCremer and Oosterwegel (1999) found that subjects with collective self-esteem tended to view in-group members more positively than those with personal self-esteem. The high collective self-esteem individuals also seemed to expect more in-group cooperation. The impact of collective self-esteem on psychological functioning such as intergroup evaluation (Andreopoulou & Houston, 2002), in-group bias (Aberson & Howanski, 2002), coping styles (Constantine, Donnelly & Myers, 2002) has been studied. Some evidence shows that collective self-esteem is a potentially strong predictor of mental health such that collective self-esteem is a potentially strong predictor of mental health such as life satisfaction (Crocker et al., 1994; Mokgathe & Schoeman, 1998) and distress (Bizman, Yinon, & Krotman, 2001; Katz, Joiner, & Kwon, 2002).Self-esteem and collective self-esteem are viewed as vicious cycle. Low self-esteem and collective self-esteem result among many behavioral problems and depression is among one of them. Depression among adolescents has become a very common problems and rate of depression is increasing day by day (SAMSHA, 2012). The literature survey depicts that self-esteem and collective self-esteem play a very important role in every individual's personality. Low level of self-esteem and depression create hindrance in balanced and positive development of personality. There is dearth of researches which examine the relationship between depression and collective self-esteem but low self-esteem and depression are negatively correlated, it has been found in many researches.The Current study aimed to examine relationship between self-esteem, collective self esteem and depression in adolescents and also to examine role of self esteem and collective self esteem in predicting depression.Hypotheses1. There is a negative relationship between self-esteem, collective self esteem and depression.2. There is a positive relationship between self-esteem and collective self-esteem.3. Self-esteem and collective self-esteem are significant predictors of depressionMethodSampleInitially Beck's Depression Inventory (1996) was administered on 800 undergraduate students in the age range of 17-23 years, selected from Agra and Firozabad, India. Among 800 participants 334 had low level of depression and 179 had high level of depression. …",

      "title": "Procrastination as a transdiagnostic construct in psychiatric disorders: a conceptual scope review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Procrastionation is commonly conceptualized as an irrational, conscious, and sometimes intentional tendency to delay the start or to complete tasks or decisions, despite consequences. The behavior may be present in several psychiatric disorders, especially OCD, ADHD and anxiety disorders However, there is no consensus definition of procrastination, nor established pathophysiology or motivation. Objectives To analyze the descriptive psychopathology as well as the presence or absence of associated symptoms, motivations, and consequences of procrastination. In sequence, to conceptualize the construct of “procrastination” based on the literature published and define the motivations and consequences of the behavior for the individuals. Methods The scoping review complies with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and included articles published English, Spanish and Portuguese, between 1973-2023 and indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS, Scielo, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO database. Research conducted in animals, poster publications, conferences in scientific conclaves, and letters to the author were excluded. Results We found 387 studies with different designs (295 [76,2%] were cross-sectional, 12 [3,1%] systematic reviews and 5 [1,3%] were meta-analysis) and published in English (86,6%), Spanish (9,3%) and Portuguese (3,9%). Only 5 studies (1.3%) used populations with AHDH and 1 study (0.02%) used a population with OCD, 7 studies (1.8%) used populations with other disorders (Depression, Anxiety) and 374 studies (96.4%) involved students (mainly university students), workers, or the general population. Of the population the majority was female (63,98%), single, young and has some occupation. In 323 articles, at least one scale was used to assess procrastination, with a total of 40 different ones. Furthermore, 337 studies define procrastination and 305 use the definition of other authors. Conclusions Procrastination is a complex event, so far without a defined concept. More investigation is necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Thinking skills are not mysterious entities existing somewhere in the mind. Some critics claim that there are no general thinking skills, and that all thinking must be about specific aspects of knowledge or linked to a particular subject in the school curriculum. Research in cognitive science and psychology is providing a clearer picture of brain and processes associated with thinking. Bloom's taxonomy of thinking skills has been widely used by teachers in planning their teaching. He identifies number of basic, or 'lower-order', cognitive skills – knowledge, comprehension and application – and a number of 'higher-order' skills – analysis, synthesis and evaluation. Research suggests that one-off 'thinking' lessons are less effective than teaching thinking and learning strategies that can be applied in subjects or as dialogic strategies across curriculum. A growing number of programmes and strategies aim to help teachers develop children's thinking and learning across the curriculum, such as Thinking Actively in a Social Context and Activating Children's Thinking Skills.",

      "title": "Social Cognition through the Lens of Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience",
      "abstract": "Social cognition refers to a set of processes, ranging from perception to decision-making, underlying the ability to decode others’ intentions and behaviors to plan actions fitting with social and moral, besides individual and economic considerations. Its centrality in everyday life reflects the neural complexity of social processing and the ubiquity of social cognitive deficits in different pathological conditions. Social cognitive processes can be clustered in three domains associated with (a) perceptual processing of social information such as faces and emotional expressions (social perception), (b) grasping others’ cognitive or affective states (social understanding), and (c) planning behaviors taking into consideration others’, in addition to one’s own, goals (social decision-making). We review these domains from the lens of cognitive neuroscience, i.e., in terms of the brain areas mediating the role of such processes in the ability to make sense of others’ behavior and plan socially appropriate actions. The increasing evidence on the “social brain” obtained from healthy young individuals nowadays constitutes the baseline for detecting changes in social cognitive skills associated with physiological aging or pathological conditions. In the latter case, impairments in one or more of the abovementioned domains represent a prominent concern, or even a core facet, of neurological (e.g., acquired brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases), psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia), and developmental (e.g., autism) disorders. To pave the way for the other papers of this issue, addressing the social cognitive deficits associated with severe acquired brain injury, we will briefly discuss the available evidence on the status of social cognition in normal aging and its breakdown in neurodegenerative disorders. Although the assessment and treatment of such impairments is a relatively novel sector in neurorehabilitation, the evidence summarized here strongly suggests that the development of remediation procedures for social cognitive skills will represent a future field of translational research in clinical neuroscience.",

      "title": "When Teacher’s Beliefs and Student’s Self-esteem Are in Conflict: A Case for Including Social Metacognition in Teacher Education Curriculum",
      "abstract": "Social metacognition is a blend of sociology, psychology and cognition. One area that this branch of study investigates is the matches and mismatches between one's assessment of oneself and the assessment by others in a social context. The pedagogical potentials of social metacognition form the core of this paper. Though not based on any empirical study, the conclusions arrived at in this study are mainly drawn from long-time observations of the changes in the behavioural patterns of school children. As the title suggests, this paper attempts to juxtapose these two fundamental concepts underlying the success (or failure) of teaching. Culturally absorbed professional behaviours such as teacher entitlement and teacher belief most often function in antithesis to children's genetically acquired self-esteem. Judgments have been cited as the main component of cognition by psychologists. We judge ourselves and we are constantly being judged by others. In these simultaneously occurring processes, the data being studied need not be the same. Even if the same, the mode of observation being subjective, judgement certainly differs; and as a result, our self-judgments need not correspond with others' assessment about us. In a social group like a class or school, this conflict leads to irreparable relationship breakdown. This paper is an attempt to study the effect of one such mismatch between teacher beliefs and student's self-judgment by applying certain fundamental principles of social metacognition in pedagogy.",

This only comes from experience, professionalism, and the support of teams and colleagues. Practitioners must be adept at thinking about benefits, burdens, autonomy, mental capacity, developing communication skills, and building trusting relationships, should respect fundamental rights, and show virtues of honesty, compassion, and courage.",

The traditional cognitive view of memory as a stable structure with a range of set characteristics can be complemented with a perspective that considers remembering as a behaviour that varies fluidly across contexts. Remembering may serve adaptation to the environment by fulfilling a directive function, a self-function and a social function. A failure to fulfil these functions may be a risk factor for psychopathology. Implications of the discussed functionalist perspective include the importance of reinforcing adaptive ways of remembering during early development, the possibility of treating maladaptive ways of remembering through contextual interventions and the added ecological validity of using ambulatory assessment methods.",

Prediction of those likely to succeed can only occur when clear concepts and definitions of vocational competence have been evolved. Employment for handicapped persons is a complex issue. One way to examine this is to look at the components involved. Four principles or themes seem to be in operation in connection with the concept of vocational competence: normalisation, employability, stickability and socialisation or personal adjustment. Apart from social skills, there are physical performance skills that are more easily measured and show correlations with personality traits and vocational outcome. As a result, severely mentally handicapped people tend to have multiple handicaps and are often reported to find it more difficult to gain competitive employment than those who are mildly retarded.",

It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better \"logical thinking\") is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called \"moral machines,\" using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a \"right\" versus \"wrong\" answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.",

      "abstract": "In the article on the basis of the analysis of scientific literature, the essence and peculiarities of self-development of a teacher of a higher educational institution are considered. It is noted that self-development as a phenomenon and psychological process is present within the limits of human activity. It is carried out in the process of manifestation of man's activity in overcoming not only critical but also traditional everyday situations. The basis of the process of self-development lies in the ability of its subject to make an expedient choice of their behavior based on a clear idea of their needs and the possibilities for their implementation. Self-development is a kind of manifestation of man's own attitude to the effects of the environment; as well as conscious and directed activities to improve the person himself. The basis of self-development is the development of the essential forces of man, which represent a combination of intelligence, feelings and his will, allowing in aggregate to develop the abilities due to the development of needs. Implementation of self-development as a special activity can be considered through the prism of three components: the ability to self-development as individual psychological personality features that determine the independent search, generation, capture and use in the life of new knowledge and skills in the process of active inclusion in various activities; knowledge of technologies and methods of selfdevelopment, since for the emergence of self-development skills, a person needs knowledge of how this process is carried out; volitional personality, as selfdevelopment implies the need to achieve certain goals that can change. The self-development of a teacher of a higher educational establishment is recognized as a purposeful process of qualitative development of culture, in which it is realized the desire of teachers to develop their essential powers, by enriching existing knowledge, acquiring and improving skills, improving personal qualities in the individual space of life and professional path. Key words:  teacher, personal and professional self-development, higher educational institution, value orientation, reflection, knowledge, skills, volitional personality.",

Currently, four models used to explain the phenomenon of test anxiety dominate the literature. These models and a variety of treatment methods are reviewed. An intergrative model is proposed which incorporated cognitive attentional variables (i.e., negative self-talk, worry thoughts, task irrelevant thinking and physiological reactions), deficits in study skills (i.e., inadequacies in the acquisitions, organization or retrieval of information), and social learning factors (i.e., self-esteem, locus of control, test-taking self-efficacy and outcome expectations).

      "abstract": "The challenges and risks to the human biological basis are related to the minimization of motor activity of the individual and the subsequent consequences of permanent hypodynamic. Regular use of physical exercises and loads in the modern information society is gaining new importance. Students, in theory, are aware of these risks and the positive impact of regular exercise on their body and life aspects in general. But this knowledge not always encourages a person to systemic efforts in the context of physical self-training. According to the authors, theoretical knowledge about physical development and improvement of the person’s motor function who has limited motor experience, enter into the cognitive dissonance with the whole list of contingent factors, such as laziness, phobias, negative emotions, etc. There is an assumption that in the area of physical activity, not only conscious cognitions occur, but also unconscious or partly-conscious, in mentioned above cognitive dissonance. The final choice is made by finding out the attitude to the perspectives of the state of one’s physical body and means of correcting unacceptable deviations of the personality in such a dissonance.&#x0D; Goal if our research is to reveal existence and correlation of conscious and unconscious in problematic area of shaping of the attitude to the exercising. Proposed goal of the research determines usage of interdisciplinary approach. During the research we used complex of methods, among which are: evaluation of the literature and practical experience, questionnaires, methods of mathematical statistics, explication of personal logical systems. During the research theoretical diagrams and developments were checked in accordance with the results of the questionnaire. 272 freshmen of the National Aviation University took part in this questionnaire. Results determined that 28,6% of students would use conscious cognitions relatively to physical training, and 71,4% would use unconscious. Students in the process of final selecting of attitude to personal physical state, unconscious (not controlled), is one of the main influential factors.",

      "abstract": "The term capacity building has been utilized as a part of strategies and process which can enhance cognitive skills. Apart from capacity building, this study investigated the role of cognitive technique to improve child outcomes through thinking strategies. The childhood years are critical for human development. It is the time when the brain develops most rapidly and a large number of children’s development take place and it is estimated that over 200 million children under 5 years of age are unable to attain their full developmental potential. Studies suggest that young children are quite limited in their knowledge about cognitive phenomena—or in their Meta cognition—and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises. The participant in the present study is from the nuclear family. As per the parents and teacher’s remark the child thinking process was below average. After doing the assessment the intervention was to develop standard procedure of thinking strategy areas that were assigned to 1 of 4 areas: Memory (e.g., measures associative memory through five item),Concept development (e.g., it included object concept and relational concepts), Reasoning (entail insight and using deductive and inductive logic), problem solving (it is related to arithmetic or quantitative situation). The treatment was evaluated by assessing the child again and qualitatively by means of interview with child, parents and teacher .The results shows that increase in the children’s cognitive skills through different thinking strategies.",

Emotional intelligence includes social deftness, emotional stability, compassion and integrity. It is defined by Goleman, Salovey and Mayer, Bar-On and others as the ability to motivate oneself, to persist in the face of frustrations; to control impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods, to keep distress from interfering with the ability to think; to empathize, to hope, to perform, to be creative.

In essence, creativity is dependent on associating a wide array of novel or divergent experiences to form a new, appropriate, idea, however closed institutions such as the U.S. Army have limited pools of divergence from which to draw, relying instead on the commanders experience, which may provide exposure to many ideas over a lengthy career, but the ability to associate them into new creative ideas may be inhibited over the same time period. The same skills that allow a commander to be successful while solving routine or simple problems may actually inhibit his ability to solve complex or ill-structured problems. The importance of enhancing creativity is to balance the concrete specialized experiences, education, and intuitions developed in successful leaders with more abstract and diverse creativity in order to promote better understanding.",

      "title": "Cognition As a Therapeutic Target in the Suicidal Patient Approach",
      "abstract": "The current considerations about completed suicides and suicide attempts in different cultures call the attention of professionals to this serious public health problem. Integrative approaches have shown that the confluence of multiple biological and social factors modulate various psychopathologies and dysfunctional behaviors, such as suicidal behavior. Considering the level of intermediate analysis, personality traits and cognitive functioning are also of great importance for understanding the suicide phenomenon. About cognitive factors, we can group them into cognitive schemas of reality interpretation and underlying cognitive processes. On the other hand, different types of primary cognitive alterations are related to suicidal behavior, especially those resulting from changes in frontostriatal circuits. Among such cognitive mechanisms can be highlighted the attentional bias for environmental cues related to suicide, impulsive behavior, verbal fluency deficits, non-adaptive decision making, and reduced planning skills. Attentional bias consists in the effect of thoughts and emotions, frequently not conscious, about the perception of environmental stimuli. Suicidal ideation and hopelessness can make the patient unable to find alternative solutions to their problems other than suicide, biasing their attention to environmental cues related to such behavior. Recent research efforts are directed to assess the possible use of attention bias as a therapeutic target in patients presenting suicide behavior. The relationship between impulsivity and suicide has been largely investigated over the last decades, and there is still controversy about the theme. Although there is strong evidence linking impulsivity to suicide attempts. Effective interventions address to reduce impulsivity in clinical populations at higher risk for suicide could help in the prevention. Deficits in problem-solving ability also seem to be distorted in patients who attempt suicide. Understanding cognitive changes in patients who attempt suicide open an important perspective in the approach of patients with mental disorders. Identifying cognitive deficits in these patients, along with personality traits, depressive symptoms, and suicidal cognitive schemas may indicate to the psychiatrist the need for emergency care. Behavioral and Cognitive interventions have been associated with reductions in suicide ideation, as well as suicide attempts in different populations.",

Mindful solitude is not an emptying of the mind, but instead an openness and sensitivity to the nuances of an individual's emotions and physical responses. Mindful solitude may encourage curiousity, awareness, and less judgment of self and others. For children and adolesents, mindful solitude may provide opportunities to momentarily disconnect from a variety of stressors that are commonly experienced by youth. These benefits of positive mindful solitude may extend to interpersonal and sexual relationships in adulthood, thus having a positive impact on both personal and relational well-being.",

      "abstract": "Abstract AN EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE LIFECYCLE MODEL INSPIRED BY HUMAN’S PHYSIOLOGYArtificial Intelligence is frequently applied to projects of developing systems endowedwith the intellectual processes in humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning,generalize, or learn from past experience. However, the question remains, Can a man-made artifact be considered conscious? In this paper, we aim to establish a directrelationship between the human physiology and software engineering for educationalpurposes.Teaching software engineering can be challenging in some cases when taught to non-engineering students. The class curriculum needs to be planned and structured to matchthe background of the students who are taking the class. The model presented in thispaper is called the Human Physiology Model for Learning (HPML). It is targeted towardsstudents in the field of biological and medical sciences (this includes biology, chemistry,medical studies, nursing, pharmacy and public health majors). Students in such majorsare often required to take part in a number of software-related classes.Human physiology had proven itself to be a successful model to follow, or at least aninspirational one for science. Especially in software engineering, fields such as geneticalgorithms, computer vision, and computer scent recognition are all examples on how toproceed towards building software systems similar to biological systems. Taking thisconcept into consideration, this paper introduces a software model that follows the humanphysiology to structure different parts of a conventional software system. Furthermore,lifecycle models can help in illustrating the different phases of software construction tostudents. For instance, HPML equates the human immune system to a safety and securitysoftware system; under this system students can learn about topics such as viruses,malware attacks, errors, defects and relate that to similar functions in the human body.Another example is the circulatory system; which controls the movement of blood whichis pumped from the heart to all the parts of the body. Similar to that functionality is thedata flow in a software system, and all its related topics (data latency, data mining,system throughput…etc). It is anticipated that this model establishes a cornerstone to acomprehensive educational lifecycle model that is fully inspired by human body systemsand their parts.",

      "title": "Apego e impulsividad. Su relación con el desempeño académico",
      "abstract": "A high level of impulsiveness may severely affect academic performance, interpersonal relationships or simply daily tasks. Adequate regulation of impulsiveness is closely related to the style of attachment. People with a secure attachment are able to self-regulate more appropriately their feelings. Impulsive people’s performance may be impaired by information gathering and organization problems, by difficulties in recovering information already stored, by inadequate regulation of attention, focus and concentration to solve tasks or taking exams. Therefore, impulsive people may face some difficulties when studying like: storing information in a superficial way, switching from one subject to another before being able to delve and consolidate the subject, and having problems to find the most relevant aspects of a piece of information when summarizing due to the feeling of urgency to finish a task quickly that the person may experience, thus affecting the selection of adequate strategies to evaluate new information or to analyze new problems to solve them. Sometimes, performance is not directly affected but, impulsive behaviour reduces learning capacity.This project was completed with the participation of 229 students from 1° and 2° year of the careers of Psychology and Educational Psychology of USAL. The operational processes of two instruments were analyzed. The Experiences in close relationships-Revised-ECR-R (Fraley,Waller &Brennan, 200) was applied in order to recognize the styles of attachment and, the State Impulsivity Scale- EIE (Irribaren M, Jimenez, Garcia, Garcia Rubio, 2011) was applied to study the state impulsivity. High levels of each factor were found in 15% of the students in the Reward factor. In the Automatism factor, there was a high level of 15.2% and, in the Attentional factor, 20% of the students have a high level. This last figure is considered to be a remarkable percentage, if it is taken into account the fact that a class is made up of 40 students. It is possible to find 8 students with high levels of impulsiveness facing difficulties in regulating attention, focus and concentration. Although no significant correlations evidencing the direct impact over the obtained amounts were found, there may be a cumulative personal discomfort growing which may produce a feeling of inefficiency when studying or incorporating new information during classes. Although this report shows that performance is not directly affected, we believe that tendency to impulsiveness reduces the capacity for enjoying while learning. Although it is an intentional sample, we consider that the data provided in this report allows a better understanding of the problem. Furthermore, we consider that this data should be taken into account when organizing workshops about learning strategies to regulate and focus attention.",

      "title": "Putting the mind in the brain: Promoting an appreciation of the biological basis to understanding human behavior",
      "abstract": "A surprising number of students in psychology, behavioral science, and related social science classes fail to appreciate the importance of biological mechanisms to understanding behavior. To help teachers promote this understanding, this paper outlines six sources of evidence. These are (a) phylogenetic, (b) genetic/developmental, (c) clinical, (d) experimental, (e) brain recordings, and (f) experiential. The evidence can be easily understood from common knowledge or personal experience and can be incorporated into an introductory level lecture. It is concluded that the successful study of human behavior requires the student to appreciate the biological basis of the discipline. ********** In my experience in teaching about human behavior to psychology, behavioral science, and related social science college students, a surprising number of them are puzzled, uncertain, or unaware of why understanding the biological basis to behavior is so important. These feelings can have a knock on effect in reducing their motivation to learn about topics like brain anatomy, neurophysiology, hormones, and genetics. There is also the danger that students will not fully appreciate the significance of neuroscience the modern day blending of the biological and psychological sciences. To motivate students and implant in them the first seeds of knowledge, I have had success in using six sources of evidence for the biological basis of behavior. The link between each source of evidence and its relevance to behavior is so obvious that it can be appreciated even in an introductory level class. These six sources of evidence are described here to provide a reference from which teachers can apply in their behavioral science class. A quote It is useful to preface the six sources of evidence with some words from Bertrand Russell, the brilliant mathematician, scientist, and philosopher. He said: The important point is, that the difference between mind and brain is not a difference in quality, but a difference in arrangement. It is like the difference between arranging people in geographical order or in alphabetical order, both of which are done in the Post Office directory.... The ancient question of the dependence of mind on brain, or brain on mind, is thus reduced to linguistic convenience. In cases where we know more about the brain it will be convenient to regard the mind as dependent, but in cases where we know more about the mind it will be convenient to regard the brain as dependent. In either case, the substantial facts are the same, and the difference is only as to the degree of our knowledge, pg. 289. is Bertrand Russell's point here? He is arguing that there may in fact be no distinction between the mind and brain. By implication, any scientific explanation for the mind will ultimately be based on the physical characteristics of our brain. That is, thinking, perceiving, remembering, desiring, and feelings are all brain functions. The claim that they are all part of the mind is merely one of linguistic convenience. Psychological science is a field in which students apply the scientific method and the tools of induction and deduction to examine behavior. The question that we must encourage our enquiring student to ask is What is the basis of behavior? The Evidence The basis of behavior is the biological processes of the brain. Some evidence in support of this claim can be detailed and complex. For instance, there is more dendrite branching of the precentral brain area in the left hemisphere than there is in the right hemisphere in right handed individuals (Toga & Thompson, 2003). This fact is not commonly thought of by teachers (or students) as supporting the dominance of the left hemisphere for language and, by implication, supporting the link between biological processes and behavior. …",

      "abstract": "The importance of knowing the processes of choice, decision-making is determined by the objective role that they play in the organization of human activity. An important feature of man is his unique ability to make decisions in the most difficult conditions of activity, which are characterized by high uncertainty, the presence of many inconsistent criteria, lack of time, high responsibility and more. The target effectiveness of the decision can be assessed only after its implementation, but the prediction of potential decisions is possible only if the study of its neuropsychological mechanisms. Cost-effectiveness is characterized by intellectual, physical, neuropsychological and material costs of decision-making. The non-standard situation, as a rule, seeks to reduce cost-effectiveness, because in this case the solutions are achieved by the exertion of intellectual, emotional and physical forces and is determined by the ability of the individual to act in such an environment. The neuropsychological mechanisms of such decisions are of interest to science in terms of ensuring the adequacy and timing of such decisions, which is hypothetically related to the morphological and psychoneurological characteristics of the subjects of action. In the context of our study, it is important to conduct a thorough psychological analysis of different types of unusual situations in the coach and find ways to improve the effectiveness of decisions, which primarily depends on the level of psychological readiness of the individual to perform its.",

      "abstract": "Transfer of learning can be demonstrated by assessment tasks mirroring real life situations. This can be attempted in real organisations, or by simulating the real, life experience in a structured case study. In this paper we discuss experiences with work situated learning and difficulties that commonly arise. The alternative of encapsulating real life experience in hypermedia based materials is then presented using a number of case studies. Finally a model is presented for producing these “real life” encapsulations which overcomes the problems of lack of structure in individual experience without losing the advantages of common lifelike experiences. Some testing of the model is presented. The model involves the steps of: • Determine real life skills commonly required • Imagine a context rich enough (and having the case study design team with enough knowledge of the context that they can draw from their experience to fill in the holes) • Structure (partition) the case so that team work is possible without too much overlap between tasks. Identify the overlapping points that will force the level of teamwork between students that is intended • Identify parts of the solution development where students can be synchronised using a published solution to part of the problem • Create answers for each skill point starting from the top • Tag each part of the answer with the essential component of information required for an answer • Determine the most likely format that the tagged information would be found in real life • Create the set of tagged information using unskilled labour to provide detailed data • Write the project brief so that an appropriate level of guidance is given for navigating the information sources",

Efficient inhibitory processes enable goals to regulate thought and action by suppressing otherwise automatic activation of goal‐irrelevant information. Deficits in inhibitory regulation result in heightened distractibility, greater knowledge of irrelevant information, sustained access to no longer relevant information, greater reliance on environmental cues, reduced working memory capacity, greater proactive interference, poorer retrieval of details, greater production of highly probable responses, and the implicit use of the recent past in new situations. Differences among individuals and among groups result from the efficiency of inhibition operating in the service of goals.",

People in power (i.e., leading and helping) roles infect others with their emotional state through the contagion of emotion. The consequences of using emotional and social intelligence competencies are amplified in work and social settings through the quality of people’s relationships. Although most attempts to develop these competencies at work and in graduate education fail, there is longitudinal evidence that they can be developed sustainably. Intentional change theory explains the physiological and psychological process that results in significant improvement in these competencies. The three most distinctive aspects of this model, in contrast to typical approaches, are (a) fostering the person’s ideal self, vision, and dream before exposing them to any data feedback; (b) using coaches to create relationships that help the person through the process; and (c) developing social identity groups that create peer coaching relationships and sustain the developments.",

In this fully rewritten and updated second edition of his groundbreaking text Evaluating in Practice, Ian Shaw demonstrates how evaluation and inquiry are just as much practice tasks as planning, intervention and review. By demonstrating that good evaluating in practice helps sustain a commitment to evidence, understanding and justice, Shaw shows that for this to be achieved, evaluating in practice must permeate every aspect of social work. He: 1. Develops a framework for embedding evaluation and inquiry as a dimension of good practice in social work. 2. Demonstrates the central significance of a 'methodological practice' in social work that adapts, infuses, and translates social research methods as a dimension of the different aspects of social work, viz. assessment, planning, intervention, review and outcomes. 3. Facilitates good practice by exemplifying the argument through extensive worked examples and exercises. This book has much to say about the demanding skills that are necessary to achieve this shaping of practice and is a must-read for any social work student or practitioner.",

      "title": "Performing Capacity Evaluations: What's Expected from Your Consult: Core Components of a Capacity Evaluation Are Understanding, Free Choice, and Reliability",
      "abstract": "One of the most common reasons medical colleagues seek consultation with a psychiatrist is to address the question of capacity. Indeed, this referral question often is posed as, Is the patient competent? This referral question is incomplete and incorrectly phrased. The question should include the domain in which capacity is being questioned--for example, Is the patient competent to refuse surgery? Specifically identifying the area in which competency is questioned is necessary because a person might be competent in one area and incompetent in another (Box 1, page 42). The question of competency should be modified as follows: Does the patient have capacity to refuse surgery? Competency is the degree of mental soundness necessary to make decisions about a specific issue or to carry out a specific act. Capacity is a person's ability to make an informed decision. A determination of competency is a judicial finding made by the court. A physician can opine about a patient's capacity but cannot determine competency. Adults are presumed to have capacity unless determined otherwise by the court. A person who lacks capacity to make an informed decision or give consent might need to be referred for a competency hearing or have a guardian appointed. Psychiatrists often are called on to provide an opinion to the court regarding a person's capacity Psychiatrists are particularly skilled at accessing a person's mental status and gauging its potential for interfering with specific areas of functioning, but, in fact, any physician can make a determination of capacity. (1) In this article, I: * outline the components of a capacity evaluation * describe the tools used in the determination of capacity * review the typical features of patients and psychiatrists who perform capacity evaluations. What constitutes a capacity evaluation? The components of a capacity evaluation are comprehension, free choice, and reliability. Comprehension refers to a patient's factual understanding of his (her) medical condition--for example, induding the risks and benefits of treatment and reasonable alternatives. The patient should show an understanding of 1) the situation as it relates to his condition, and 2) the consequences of his decisions. He also should demonstrate a rational manipulation of the information presented, applying a coherent and logical thought process to analyze possible courses of action. (2) To determine if the patient has the requisite knowledge regarding his condition, the physician must be familiar with the patient's clinical status. This might require consultation with the treating physician. Communication is a key component of capacity evaluations. Barriers to good communication can lead to the evaluating physician's perception that the patient lacks capacity. If a patient does not understand his condition or the proposed treatments, the psychiatrist should educate him. It might be useful to arrange a meeting with the treating physician to facilitate communication. Free choice. The patient's decision to accept or reject a proposed treatment should be voluntary and free of coercion. In assessing a patient's capacity, the psychiatrist should determine whether choices have been rendered impossible because of unrealistic fears or expectations about treatment, or because of impaired mental processes. Reliability refers to a patient's ability to provide a consistent choice over time. A patient who vacillates or is inconsistent does not have capacity to make decisions. Features of patients referred for evaluation, and their evaluators The most common reason for a capacity evaluation is a patient's refusal of medical treatment. Between 3% and 25% of requests for psychiatric consultation in hospital settings involve questions about patients' competence to make a treatment-related decision. (3) Approximately 25% of adult medicine inpatients lack capacity for medical decision-making. …",

Sehingga seseorang itu akan dengan mudah memutuskan sebuah solusi yang akan dipakainya dalam memecahkan suatu masalah.",

      "abstract": "Preserving the autonomy of individuals with intellectual disabilities in group work is challenging. Group workers often experience inadequate guidance about autonomy—an individual's capability to act independently without influence by others. Group workers can enhance autonomy through group activities that promote self-efficacy, empowerment, and the ability to make decisions. Fostering autonomy requires that the group workers be knowledgeable and aware of personal biases, analyzing their expectations and actions. To promote the autonomy of persons with intellectual disabilities in group work practice, the authors make recommendations to strengthen the IASWG Standards for Social Work Practice with Groups in this area.",

      "abstract": "Education is a human right, but some youngsters still drop out of school. One reason for that might be student's teacher-perceived inappropriate or even \"wrong\" temperament (i.e., individual's innate way to approach and react to the environment) for school environment. There is a lot of evidence that the school grades are mostly based on teacher-perceived ratings rather than standardized tests. Temperament can be seen as a non-academic aspect of educational process, but it strongly influences academic outcomes. Final marks will direct (through universities or lack of education) one's place in the labour market, and people's general well-being with the subjective perceptions of happiness and self-esteem. The aim of this research has been to develop the field: temperament can't be the reason of (good or bad) grades. Humanistic teachers of 21st century should have better knowledge's in psychology, especially in the context of temperament. To integrate temperament-conscious pedagogy (i.e., the acceptance of temperamental background of the behaviour as a part of teachers' didactical, pedagogical and practical knowledge) in regular teacher training it might be possible to identify potential difficulties in educational pathways and prevent social exclusion. The aim of this article is to analyze conceptual similarities between humanistic education, social pedagogy and temperament-conscious teaching—to show their significant joint part. The research method used here is the content analysis of definitions.",

For example, those with a more analytic thinking style are more skeptical about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial concepts. In addition, analytic thinking relates to having less traditional moral values, making less emotional or disgust-based moral judgments, and being less cooperative and more rationally self-interested in social dilemmas. Analytic thinkers are even less likely to offload thinking to smartphone technology and may be more creative. Taken together, these results indicate that the propensity to think analytically has major consequences for individual psychology.",

      "title": "Agency and Autonomy as a Learning Outcome: Distinguishing Notions",
      "abstract": "The article explores conceptual difference between the notions of \"autonomy\" and \"agency\" in relation to students' learning outcomes. These concepts are often used as synonyms. We argue that distinguishing between them is more productive for practical pedagogy. Unfolding the essence of agentive action in 9 theoretical theses based on sociological and psychological approaches, we trace its prerequisites and outline the forks where agency and autonomy diverge. Agency implies a desire for change based on a consciously constructed identity and values. Independence focuses on achieving mastery within existing roles and social norms. In a social sense, in the continuity/change pair, independence aims at continuity, while agency aims at change. Distinguishing these concepts will help consciously design learning situations and set realistic learning outcomes. However, can agency be a realistic measurable learning outcome in the conventional sense? Probably not, since it is tied to identity and personal attitudes towards social situations, and will therefore be very individual. Autonomy as a learning outcome is simpler, for ultimately it requires comparing the student's skills to those of an adult. The key factor differentiating autonomy and agency is the nature of the individual's identity--its orientation towards reproducing the existing or towards individual search and change.",

Dans ce cadre, les difficultés d’apprentissage sont alors considérées comme des dysfonctionnements du cerveau par rapport à une norme biologique définie. En utilisant les apports des neurosciences de l’éducation, l’enseignant pourrait ainsi devenir le praticien d’une éducation basée sur des résultats scientifiques. L’enseignement recommandé affichera-t-il alors des objectifs mesurables ou encouragera-t-on des buts tels que « penser plus clairement » ou « capacité à débattre » ? Par quelles valeurs seront sous-tendues des pratiques éducatives validées par des résultats scientifiques ? En conséquence, si nous voulons échapper à un formatage en règle de nos cerveaux, il semble nécessaire de prendre en compte le sujet, enfant ou adulte, dont les neurosciences cognitives désirent faire l’éducation.",

It is claimed that the psychological practices in education may result innegative consequences through lack of high validity methods of diagnosing mental (intellectualand creative) giftedness. The selection of relevant psychodiagnostic procedures and methods ofworking with gifted individuals must be determined by a psychologically substantiated systemictheory of giftedness which is based on contemporary ideas of uniqueness and originality of theabove-mentioned integral phenomena of the human psyche.The author provides a critical analysis of the psychometric (testometric) approach to diagnosingintellectual and creative giftedness (IQ index and creativity index). It is claimed that standardizedtests are a priori unfit to objectively measure either the actual or the potential mental giftedness ofan individual.The article explores the classifications of giftedness types in terms of quantitative criteria(indices), personality traits, occupations, motivation. The author questions the correctness ofpositing ‘creativity’ as an independent type of giftedness. It is argued that mental (intellectual andcreative) giftedness is an inseparable structural and functional unity, a systemic attribute of psycheand is revealed as talents, personality traits and metacognitive experience in various activities.The author argues for the cognitive style approach to diagnosing mental giftedness. It ishypothesized that it can serve as a theoretical foundation for developing a systemic technique ofdiagnosing general giftedness, complies with the main principles of humanizing the educationalspace in Ukraine and is truly child-oriented, i.e. considers every individual’s uniqueness andinimitability.",

In the present research an attempt is made experimentally to examine this issue from the viewpoint of the self‐perception hypothesis. From this perspective, immersion in the successful helping dyad was expected to foster an increased belief in self as other‐reliant, and, through cognitive balance, a lessened belief in self as self‐reliant. The fiidings indicate that such different dimensions of help as intensity, duration, and choice variously affect these attributions to self, and that these attributions in turn affect the strength of behavioral independence when failure is encountered outside the helping dyad. Some practical and theoretical implications are discussed concerning the role of induction from self‐performance in mapping self‐related beliefs.",

How does SRL develop? What role does affect have in SRL? What can be done with models and principles? My answers to these questions are partial and provisional, pending further empirical studies, but they align with my initial theses that SRL (a) is inherent in learning, (b) is more alike than different from cognition in general, and (c) need not involve deliberation once procedural knowledge that comprises self-regulation has become thoroughly automated.",

Even though in many quarters, psychologists have distanced themselves from such questions – call them philosophical – the inescapable truth is that they surface in all psychologies, pure and applied. Psychology asks these questions and psychology answers them.

      "title": "Performance Of Extrovert Prospective Engineers In Campus Placements And Their Perception Of Soft Skills In Qualifying The Same",
      "abstract": "AbstractSoft skills have been defined in a number of ways in the literature. They are also referred to by different names such as 'key skills', 'core skills', 'essential skills' and 'soft skills' in different countries. Though different names are given to these skills in different countries, by and large they encompass the same range of skills: communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, problem solving, reflection, critical thinking and leadership skills, self-confidence, conformity to norms, language proficiency etc. A number of studies are presented in this paper wherein need for possession of soft skills by the future workforce is emphasized. Personality plays a significant role in a job search as well as in job performance and learning. So it becomes important to examine one of the most obvious aspects of personality – extroversion versus introversion. Extroverts possess traits such as sociability, talkativeness, activeness, and assertiveness. Introverts tend to be low-key, deliberate, and relatively less engaged in social situations. Understanding and appreciating the strengths and weaknesses associated with introverted and extroverted personality styles can mean the difference between success and failure in campus placements and later at the workplace. The present study is conducted with a view to examine the performance of extrovert/introvert prospective engineers in campus placements, their perceptions of knowledge of soft skills and their views regarding activities for developing them in the institution. The recruitment process followed by some of the leading Software firms takes into account two to four of the following types of rounds: aptitude tests, technical rounds, group discussions and HR interviews. The Eysenck Personality Inventory was used to classify prospective engineers on extroversion and introversion. The introverts were found to perform better than extroverts on aptitude test. Both groups need further training in soft skills to become successful in getting jobs. Engineering institutions should pay more attention to the development of soft skills like communication skills, team building skills and interpersonal skills.",

Attributes of individuals with ASD in relation to Social Story intervention including difficulties with theory of mind (involving perspective taking and emotion perception), weak central coherence, visual learning style, intellectual ability and comprehension, and stimulus overselectivity are considered. In addition, behavioural explanations are explored. Probably the most parsimonious explanation is that Social Stories may be viewed as loose contingency contracts, which highlight natural reinforcers.

Background: Healthcare outcomes are many times the result of meaningful interactions between multiple factors from different domains such as physical design, operations, culture, psychology, physiology, and social, among others. Simple multivariate models may not (a) capture these intricate relationships, (b) provide predictive precision, and (c) optimize arguments behind design decisions. Methods: A review of text books and publications on research methods was conducted, along with a review of completed research studies to identify appropriate examples for articulation. Results: An analysis of a nonrandom sample of completed healthcare design studies demonstrates the potential benefits of developing and testing moderator and mediator models in healthcare design studies. Conclusions: Moderator and mediator models may help optimize multifaceted solutions that include simultaneous and parallel interventions in the physical, operational, cultural, psychological, physiological, social, and/or other environments hypothesized to play a role in the outcome of interest.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Smartphone apps might offer a low-threshold approach to the detection of mental health conditions, such as depression. Based on the gathering of ‘passive data,’ some apps generate a user’s ‘digital phenotype,’ compare it to those of users with clinically confirmed depression and issue a warning if a depressive episode is likely. These apps can, thus, serve as epistemic tools for affected users. From an ethical perspective, it is crucial to consider epistemic injustice to promote socially responsible innovations within digital mental healthcare. In cases of epistemic injustice, people are wronged specifically as epistemic agents, i.e., agents of the production and distribution of knowledge. We suggest that epistemic agency relies on different resource- and uptake-related preconditions which can be impacted by the functionality of passive self-tracking apps. We consider how this can lead to different forms of epistemic injustice (testimonial, hermeneutical, and contributory injustice) and analyze the influence of the apps’ use on epistemic practices on an individual level, in mental healthcare settings, and on the structural level.",

Nowadays it is relatively well documented that significant life events may increase an individual's susceptibility to the development of physical or psychic illness. \"Life events research\" is grounded on the stress concept, and in our practice is integrated into the bio-psycho-social approach. Bereavement, problems at work, disruption of deep rooted life habits, social isolation, family problems and poor socio-economic conditions are the most important of these events. Their impact depends on the real or symbolic meaning given to them, on the available coping mechanism, on the presence or absence of social support, and also on the stage in the life cycle at which the events occur.

Individual preferences are normatively assumed to be well-ordered and consistent, but descriptively shown to be inconsistent and malleable. Not having at their disposal clear and reliable procedures for assigning values to options, people need to construct their preferences in the context of decision, which is rife with, among other things, conflict, emotion, contextual influences, and shifts in perspective and attention. Like many other traits and behaviors, preference inconsistency is the outcome not of distracted shortcuts or avoidable errors, but of fundamental aspects of mental life that are central to how people process information. Thus, it may help to think of individual decision makers not as faulty economic agents, but as fundamentally different creatures.",

Implicit measures assess constructs that are distinct, but related, to self-report assessments, and predict variation in behavior that is not accounted for by those explicit measures. The present state of knowledge provides a foundation for the next age of implicit social cognition – clarification of the mechanisms underlying implicit measurement and how the measured constructs influence behavior.",

By questioning its foundations, whether it is a matter of self-narration, the power to act or of self-development, this article finds that they are part of informal education. Thus, the “recovery” may appear as an attempt at valorization and self-valorization of the results of the experience of chronic disorders. It allows the patient to develop his power to act and to develop the means to best adapt to the new regime of life, with its problems, in self-education. This approach has uncovered roles for education and research in the case of some patients. The “recovery” being both learning the art of loss and the art of living again, it can be conceived as an essential analytic tool, a heterotopia of education for self-acceptance, and for acceptance of others and the world.",

The author analyses such concepts as “health”, “psychological health”, identifies the main functions and manifestations of psychological health. A significant number of scholars, having studied scientific sources on psychological health, identify the following criteria of psychological health of an individual: interest in oneself and public interest, self-control and stress resistance. Among the psychological mechanisms that ensure mental health, self-control plays a leading role. Self-control is involved in all types of human activity: play, study, work, research, sports, etc. Self-control permeates all mental phenomena inherent in a person (processes, states, properties). The basis of a person’s self-control is the will – a mental process that causes human activity and encourages people to overcome obstacles. It leads to the development of self-control, organisation, patience, determination and stress resistance. Volitional self-control should be aimed at self-education. The state of a person’s health directly depends on the level of awareness of the individual’s own responsibility for his or her health, and the determination to improve and maintain it. An important indicator that allows to assess the responsibility of a person for his/her own health is self-assessment or subjective assessment of the person’s health and self-control.",

By emphasizing embodiment, relationality, and participatory sense-making, enactivism encourages AI-based interventions that are highly personalized, context-sensitive, and ethically aware. This paper explores how existing AI applications—ranging from socially assistive robots and virtual reality (VR) therapies to language-processing apps and personalized treatment planning—may be enhanced by incorporating enactivist principles. Despite their promise, practical adoption of AI technologies in real-world clinical practice remains limited, and persistent challenges such as algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, and the tendency to overlook subjective dimensions raise cautionary notes. Drawing on relevant philosophical literature, empirical studies, and cross-disciplinary debates (including the friction and potential synergies between predictive processing and enactivism), we argue that AI solutions grounded in enactivist thinking can more effectively honor user autonomy, acknowledge the embodied nature of neurodiverse cognition, and avoid reductive standardizations. This expanded, revised version integrates insights on neurodiversity, mental health paradigms, and the ethical imperatives of AI deployment, thereby offering a more comprehensive roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and system developers alike.",

Currently most of the educational programmes in the world are based on traditional and technological perspectives which help people to reach out to their expectations such as career and money. Traditional and technological education programmes address the development of the cognitive domain of learning. Philosophers, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, and educators have begun to criticize the dominant side of cognitive learning since the beginning of the nineteenth century. Because there is a missing point in humans' lives and this point is defined as affective development. Affective domain as a huge area inclusive of ego, motivation, concern, attitude, value, self-respect, ethics, self-control, curiosity, creativity, mental health, dependence, personality development, group dynamics and dreams. In terms of business, these concepts address soft skills. In terms of education, affective domain refers to humanistic curriculum and there are unique outcomes because of individual differences, backgrounds, and experiences. The aim of this study is to discuss why we need a humanistic curriculum because there has yet to be designed a pure humanistic curriculum.",

They can cause one to see the world in a negative light, which can lead to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance misuse, and even suicidal ideas. To improve one's mental health, it is essential to be able to identify and challenge cognitive distortions and replace them with more realistic and positive thoughts. Cognitive distortions that are examined include emotional reasoning, catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, dichotomous (also known as dualistic) thinking, mind reading, labeling, discounting positives, and blaming.

      "abstract": "Insincerity of respondents in sociological research is a challenge affecting both quality of the sociological tool and the quality of the data obtained, especially features of the psychological interaction. Insincerity is information which respondents distort intentionally. However, there are two types of such insincerity - ‘objective’, i.e. a protective strategy used to deliberately hide some information, and ‘subjective’, when a respondent is forced to provide irrelevant information due to misunderstanding the question or incompetence. Nonverbal manifestations inform of thoughts and sometimes motives of respondents’ answers. In the example given in the article the ‘objective’ insincerity prevails due to the sensitive topic, while in other types of similar surveys the ‘subjective’ insincerity usually takes place too. Insincerity is not an emotion, rather a complex of cognitive attitudes and processes in a form of respond to a stimuli, but insincerity is accompanied by emotions which are the main differentiating signs of types of insincerity. Using the technology for the analysis of respondents’ nonverbal reactions in sociological research, we can identify the type of insincerity. The authors provide examples of certain emotions as reactions to specific provocative questions under the experiment and make a conclusion about the possibilities to identify not only incorrect or ‘threatening’ questions, but also the types of insincerity when answering such questions.",

Objective definitions of successful aging based on physical health emphasize outcomes including freedom from disability and disease, whereas subjective definitions center on well-being, social connectedness, and adaptation. Most older people do not meet objective criteria for successful aging, while a majority meet the subjective criteria. Older people with severe mental illness are not excluded from successful aging. The determinants of successful aging include complex interactions of lifestyle behaviors and social environment with genes. Depression interferes with nearly all determinants of successful aging. Evidence-based means of enhancing successful aging include calorie restriction, physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, social support, and optimization of stress. Future directions for successful aging research and implications for geriatric psychiatry are discussed.",

Doctors have more stress related mental health problems than general population. Burnout is inability to cope with emotional stress at work. It consists of 3 domains; emotional exhaustion, depersonalization &amp; lack of personal accomplishment. Various models like demand–control imbalance, effort–reward imbalance &amp; support model explain evolution of work related stress. Common causes of stress are related to patient care, decision making, taking responsibility, increasing use of technology, continuing rises in health care costs, turbulence within work environment, long working hours &amp; over-working. Stress causes physical symptoms, mental derangements, emotional &amp; behavioural disturbances. Research suggests that high stress levels may impair immune system with increased risk of cardiovascular disease &amp; cancer. Stress can be modified by appropriate stress management skills like avoiding cynicism, reading, joining a support group, attending a wellness conference, strengthening communication skills, addressing to spiritual needs, meditation &amp; decreasing caffeine. Burnout prevention should be done both on both personal &amp; organizational levels. Appropriate interventions like improving inter-professional relationships, changes in work environment, modifying off duty time &amp; streamlining decision making should be done to mitigate the effect of stress on doctors.",

There are still some challenges in choosing methods of how to use and combine online tools successfully as well as on the tool design. For instance, low engagement with online learning environments is frequent and diverse. This issue may be because there is no careful thoughtfulness of practices or the tools used themself are too awkward or do not support well the contextual needs of the learners. Simple issues such as internet connection, tool ecology mismatch and choice of practices are also crucial for design consideration. Our framework follows cognitive brain research as it provides a clear starting point of combining design and practices for better online learning. Some of the brain research findings fit design and learning and are known to all but demonstrate to be true by brain research recently (For example, issues such as physical activity as well as active self-controlled thinking help learning. Similarly, sleeping enough boosts learning, constructive and timely feedback enhance learning, and having and keeping attention is crucial, but dependent on working memory and meaning-making also provides the long term memory and transferability.

Rehabilitation aims to remediate the life-changing social handicap that results from neurobehavioural disability, allowing people to return to meaningful social lives. The concept of augmenting cognitive functions through technology is not new, or even unfamiliar. The neurobehavioural paradigm of rehabilitation arose to meet the needs of persons with disability due to: disorders of drive, including changes to initiative or motivation which prevent adequate self-care. It also includes disorders of inhibitory and regulatory control that impair judgement in the management of one's affairs and disorders of personality that lead to anti-social forms of behaviour that put the person or others at risk. In brain injury rehabilitation, scheduling often requires supportive antecedent prompts and consequential rewards, with the aim of increasing the frequency and duration of this purposeful behaviour.",

However, behavior cannot be understood solely by looking at the brain alone; the roles of the context, task, and practice are potent forces in shaping behavior. According to these ideas, we present a work experience to reflect on: 1) the variations of how people learn, 2) the learning potential of students with learning disabilities, and 3) computers as a tool to learn and to analyze student’s reading comprehension processes. In this vein, we present and discuss an example of how different types of readers (average, dyslexia, and hemispherectomy) undertake a computer self-regulated reading comprehension task. This is not an experimental research study and results cannot be generalized. Theoretical and educational implications are discussed in line with the proposed aims.",

      "title": "\"It's Not Brain Surgery\": Construction of Professional Identity Through Personal Narrative",
      "abstract": "This article addresses how the professional identity of a teacher is constructed through narrative with two intended goals: 1) to examine the ways in which theories of teacher education are embedded in professional identity, and 2) to suggest the inclusion of individual narrative analysis as a reflective tool in professional development and teacher education. A teacher’s spontaneous conversation about his or her work is analyzed in terms of personal and professional knowledge, collegiality and isolation, and teaching as a reflective practice versus technical activity. The complex, and sometimes contradictory, results support the obvious challenges and tensions facing teacher education; however, the use of conversation analysis as a tool for teachers to examine their own identity offers a new dimension to reflective inquiry, allowing teachers to make connections among public images, individual thoughts, and professional practice. Public images of teachers as ill-prepared, unskilled workers are often displayed in media and reflected in public conversations. Judgments such as those who can’t do, teach along with complaints that teachers do not work enough hours and have insufficient preparation are part of a public discourse in which teaching is reduced to a non-challenging career choice. Every so often someone stands up for the martyr teacher who is recognized for unfaltering dedication and personal sacrifice—this constitutes a good newspaper story or movie screenplay. These polarized images present public images of teachers as incompetent buffoons or social miracle workers. Professional educators, on the other hand, work in the area between these stereotypes and are aware of the complex nature of teaching, the intellectual involvement, and institutional constraints that define the profession. The gap between public and academic conceptualizations of teaching inspired me to ask the question of how teachers see themselves as professionals within this dichotomy. How do teachers portray their professional lives in casual conversation? First, the narrative analysis in this study is presented as part of a process of understanding how certain images of teaching are constructed through language and embedded in a teacher’s talk about his work. Second, the narrative is explored as a potential tool for professional development.",

      "abstract": "The article presents a theoretical analysis of some modern problems of professional training of future workers in the social sphere for self-preservation in the period of martial law. According to the purpose of the research, the need to clarify and expand the meaning of the concept of \"self-preservation\", which is traditionally associated with a natural instinct, special behavior in stressful situations, has been identified. Manifestations of self-preservation of future workers in the social sphere are noted, including: self-knowledge, awareness of emotions, moods, feelings, self-acceptance; analysis and adequate assessment of one's condition; understanding of one's capabilities, abilities (mainly physical, intellectual, mental); self-control and stress resistance; self-motivation, overcoming internal barriers to achieve the goal; critical thinking in various situations, the ability to quickly find a way out, generate new ideas; predict emotional and professional burnout, as the need to preserve one's own mental health while performing official duties. Based on the analysis of domestic scientific psychological and pedagogical sources, the problem of the lack of targeted and substantiated research on the formation of self-preservation skills in future workers of the social sphere, which would take into account current events on the territory of Ukraine and the needs of citizens for help, support and protection, who suffered from military aggression, was revealed from the Russian Federation, were forced to evacuate to safe places, were subjected to mental and moral pressure. The article reveals the peculiarities of volunteering as a way of practical implementation of self-preservation of future specialists during the period of martial law. During the study, the need to modernize the existing system of professional training of future workers in the social sphere for self-preservation and work in martial law conditions was revealed. Modern educational and professional programs do not foresee the need for the formation of skills for self-preservation, do not contain special disciplines, and therefore cannot provide high-quality training of highly qualified specialists. In addition, it has been proven that the professional activity of future workers in the social sphere is closely related to health (physical, mental, social, spiritual), therefore, in the process of obtaining higher education, one should strive for awareness of the internal connections between health and self-preservation.",

A survey of what is being taught physicians about interpersonal communication is irrelevant without careful definition. Performance skills carry the same obligation for precise definition as does nosology. For example, as a communication skills teacher, I can train people to argue a case, participate in a committee meeting, conduct several kinds of interviews (gathering information, journalistic, analytic, and the like). I can teach the routines of phatic communion, methods of following social norms, techniques of offering consolation and solace, and many things. These are not amenable to a consistent form of instruction. Each has its own nuances",

      "abstract": "The restorative function of sleep is shaped by its duration, timing, continuity, subjective quality, and efficiency. Current sleep recommendations specify only nocturnal duration and have been largely derived from sleep self-reports that can be imprecise and miss relevant details. Sleep duration, preferred timing, and ability to withstand sleep deprivation are heritable traits whose expression may change with age and affect the optimal sleep prescription for an individual. Prevailing societal norms and circumstances related to work and relationships interact to influence sleep opportunity and quality. The value of allocating time for sleep is revealed by the impact of its restriction on behavior, functional brain imaging, sleep macrostructure, and late-life cognition. Augmentation of sleep slow oscillations and spindles have been proposed for enhancing sleep quality, but they inconsistently achieve their goal. Crafting bespoke sleep recommendations could benefit from large-scale, longitudinal collection of objective sleep data integrated with behavioral and self-reported data.",

In recent years, the idea that emotional experience is not preformed but discovered during the act of expression allowed emotions to be emancipated from their role as catalysts of creative processes and to be studied as a product of creativity. Assuming that under normal circumstances, people differ in the way they experience new emotions, a group of adolescents and a group of adult educators of two workshops on emotion and development were evaluated in terms of how creatively they represented their emotional experiences. Participants were asked to elaborate emotions during three different activities that were aimed at emotional recognition and production. The answers were evaluated in terms of Torrance’s dimensions of creativity, namely fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. In general, the participants used poorly diversified words to describe what they were feeling during the activities. They also differ in terms of the answers’ fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. Therefore the comprehension and education of emotion needs to be promoted in the actual society.",

It presents the results of studying the students' uniqueness depending on the type of worldview: optimistic and pessimistic. Many phenomena of the inner world, mental states and processes depend on the features of the personal attitude system. In our opinion, optimism as a system of attitudes, assessments and worldview is an active life position of the personality that influences the choice of behaviour models, role stances and resilience to psychological stress. Optimism is an individual’s stable attitude to difficulties, based on the belief in the success and strength of human nature. The project reflects the development of a model for the creation of a positive optimistic attitude for this activity with a number of objectives: forming a positive attitude towards others; forming a positive attitude towards oneself, increasing the level of self-acceptance, self-esteem; shaping a life prospect; developing strong-willed regulation, skills to control life situations and the formation of a positive attribution style of explaining successes and failures; forming an awareness of the close relationship between mental and physiological states. The development model of the pessimist's personality structure comprises four modules: Social-communicative, Personal-semantic, Predictive, Cognitive-activity.",

Because psychological services are reactive, serving the clients that come out of a particular social context, different theories have emerged over time to address the ills of the day. Many of the practice challenges for social work practitioners today are related to diseases of the spiritual dimension or what has been labeled \"spiritual malaise,\" including values deficits, moral apathy, existential despair, spiritual emergencies, and the like. Transpersonal psychology is the only one of the four force theories that includes the spiritual dimension. To remain relevant in a postmodern world, social work education must fill the current void in curricula by incorporating the comprehensive perspective of transpersonal theory into education and practice.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Professional practice in psychology involves significant emotional and ethical demands, particularly in the early stages of a psychological career. Despite the growing discussion surrounding self-care, the integration of this topic into academic psychology training remains overlooked, and there is still a lack of research in this area. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the perceptions of final-year psychology students undertaking curricular or professional internships regarding the relevance of self-care to professional practice. It also sought to identify the strategies used by these interns and to understand the role of such strategies in developing good professional practice. Methodology: A qualitative methodology was adopted, involving eight semi-structured interviews with psychology interns. Data analysis followed the principles of thematic analysis as proposed by Braun and Clarke. Results: The participants demonstrated a clear understanding of the concept of self-care, identifying various strategies such as physical activity, meditation, hobbies, psychotherapy, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and social support. They recognized self-care as inseparable from professional practice, viewing it as both an ethical commitment and a health-promoting strategy. However, they pointed out the lack of content on the topic within academic training as well as the scarcity of institutional support resources for psychology interns. Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need to integrate the theme of self-care into psychology training programs. Promoting self-care practices from the academic stage may foster more self-aware, empathetic, and resilient professionals, helping to prevent early burnout and enhance the quality of clinical interventions.",

Emphasis was placed on showing how these conceptualizations compliment each other. Several perspectives were presented, specifically, that both the essential components of the self-regulatory system along with the environments that promote self-regulated behavior must be isolated. Self-regulation was described as a complex skill that develops like other skills and can be taught through behavioral techniques. Self-regulation was suggested to basically be a linguistically guided process. The assertion was made that individuals with retardation, because of their extensive language deficiencies, are delayed in developing self-regulatory control. The role of life experience and motivational processes in the development of self-regulation was also stressed.",

      "abstract": "Today's working world poses many challenges to employees while compressed with personal struggles in daily life. Worker burnout and continuously recruiting and training highly qualified workers is a significant challenge that affects organizational performance. Therefore, both organizations and employees are struggling to find harmony in personal life and professional life. Limited studies are investigating how 'mindfulness' can be used as a tool to balance working and family life. This conceptual study aims to identify the challenges to work-life balance and how those challenges can be mitigated or overcome through right mindfulness in a Buddhist concept, which is mainly based on the noble eightfold path. According to the Pali canonical reading in Buddhism, it has clearly explained that how personal life and working life can be balanced through developing ethical conduct (Sila) and mental discipline (Samadhi), and wisdom (Panna). Based on the existing literature, this paper offers a conceptual framework that outlines how practicing mindfulness could effectively mitigate the challenges related to work-life balance via understanding the model of five aggregates: (i) stress and burnout, (ii) lack of emotional intelligence, (iii) low level of concentration to a particular task (iv) inability of prioritizing work, and, and (v) shortfall of motivation to follow the desired goal. Furthermore, it offers insights related to how mindfulness could positively influence the individual perception related to external environmental factors that are beyond the control of employees, such as the organizational policies, rules, and regulations, poor management decisions, and internal politics, to view such factors with an open mind. Overall, this paper suggests strategies adopted by the organization to support an effective work-life balance.\r\nKeywords: Challengers of work-life balance, Five Aggregates, Noble Eightfold Path, Mindfulness, Work-life Balance",

      "abstract": "Human actions, emotions, and decision making are products of complex interactions between explicit and implicit processes at various levels of spatial and temporal scales. Although it may not be possible to obtain to experimental data for all the complexity of human behavioral and emotional processes in our everyday life, recent studies have investigated the effects of social contexts on actions, emotions, and decision making; these studies include those in the fields of experimental psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. In this paper, we review several empirical studies that exemplify how our actions, social emotions, and decision making are influenced by the presence of implicit external, rather than internal factors, particularly by presence of other individuals. The following are the main principles identified. (1) Unconscious behavioral contagion: Individuals tend to mimic others' actions. This tendency occurs unconsciously even when the observed and the to-be-executed movements are unrelated at various levels and aspects of behaviors (e. g., behavioral tempo and speed). (2) Neural substrates of social emotions: Various social emotions, including admiration, compassion, envy, and schadenfreude, are represented in neuronal networks that are similar to those of basic emotional processes. (3) Evasive nature of human decision making: Individuals tend to overrate their own subjective impression of and emotional reaction in forecasting affective reaction to events in the future, even though the predictive power of information from peer group is much larger in this regard. Individuals are seldom aware of the dissociation between their intended choice and excuted actions and are willing to give elaborate explanations for the choices they, in fact, did not make. Using these empirical examples, I will illustrate the considerable influences of implicit, unconscious processes on human actions, emotions, and decision making.",

This article describes this method of learning and teaching in small groups and explains why it has had an important impact on medical education.\n\n ![][1] \n\nThe group learning process: acquiring desirable learning skills\n\nIn problem based learning (PBL) students use “triggers” from the problem case or scenario to define their own learning objectives. Subsequently they do independent, self directed study before returning to the group to discuss and refine their acquired knowledge. Thus, PBL is not about problem solving per se, but rather it uses appropriate problems to increase knowledge and understanding. The process is clearly defined, and the several variations that exist all follow a similar series of steps.\n\n#### Generic skills and attitudes\n\nGroup learning facilitates not only the acquisition of knowledge but also several other desirable attributes, such as communication skills, teamwork, problem solving, independent responsibility for learning, sharing information, and respect for others. PBL can therefore be thought of as a small group teaching method that combines the acquisition of knowledge with the development of generic skills and attitudes. Presentation of clinical material as the stimulus for learning enables students to understand the relevance of underlying scientific knowledge and principles in clinical practice.\n\nHowever, when PBL is introduced into a curriculum, several other issues for curriculum design and implementation need to be tackled. PBL is generally introduced in the context of a defined core curriculum and integration of basic and clinical sciences. It has implications for staffing and learning resources and demands a different approach to timetabling, workload, and assessment. PBL is often used to deliver core material in non-clinical parts of the …\n\n [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

Resilience requires the cultivation of their capacities for self-awareness, self-regulation, and social awareness that enable BBY to confront loss, trauma, and emotionally taxing situations. Emotional resilience emerges from the utilization of self-awareness coping strategies, including the acknowledgment of pain, self-affirmation, and personal efficacy. Likewise, it stems from social awareness strategies, such as resisting racism. Help-seeking and providing assistance to others are especially effective routes to emotional resilience. Furthermore, emotional resilience is facilitated by self-control strategies, such as emotional acceptance, redirection, and reframing.",

      "abstract": "Doctoral-level graduate training is, by definition, very demanding from a cognitive perspective. As graduate students adjust to the significant academic demands of doctoral education, they are often in a period of financial, personal, and relational flux or challenge. In addition to what are likely more obvious social and emotional effects, cognitive performance may be impacted by these stressors and negatively impact doctoral training. In terms of cognitive functioning, these stressors most clearly affect working memory—the limited capacity to hold and engage units of information or concepts in one’s active thought. This foundational functional capacity is utilized in complex thought, problem solving, and learning/memory. Under stress, working memory might be over-utilized and then may become degraded during these times of distress, negatively impacting performance in the doctoral program. In these instances of stress, the limited capacity of working memory becomes allocated to the stressors rather than to the complex and high-level thinking of doctoral training and education. Graduate program directors must therefore consider not only how best to mitigate the risks of psychological and social difficulties related to these stressors, but also work to minimize the impact of these stressors upon cognitive performance. Given the potential influence upon academic and cognitive performance in graduate studies, the impact of stressful events upon working memory and the related effects upon cognition/cognitive performance and potential interventions/recommendations to enhance graduate student performance are considered.",

The theoretical data on the role of forgiveness in maintaining physical and mental health are presented. The factors that impede the process of forgiving as well as those contributing to it are considered. It is hypothesized that there exist certain personal factors which determine the manifestation of higher level of forgiveness.

Systemic profiles that should make the prime object of formal education incorporate systemic habits of life and embody exceptional systemic traits. Systemic habits of life are habits of looking at the world and dealing with it with systemic worldview and mindset. They evolve from gradual development of systemic competencies. A systemic competency consists of an appropriate mix of conceptions (concepts and relations among concepts), reasoning skills, sensorimotor skills, and axio-affective controls (in particular, a good value system and constructive attitudes and dispositions) that are necessary to successfully achieve a given category of tasks falling within the scope of a particular discipline or cutting across different disciplines from the same or different fields. Traits promoted by SCE turn systemic profiles into what we call 4P profiles. A person with a systemic 4P profile is characterized with a progressive mind that seeks to develop and constantly enhance productive habits for systematizing and optimizing the person quest for, and deployment of, profound knowledge that concentrates on substantial and generic conceptions and processes in any domain, all with commitment to principled conduct in all aspects of life. The chapter begins with a broad taxonomy of declarative and procedural knowledge we ordinarily construct and deploy in our thoughts and actions. It follows with a discussion of systemic competencies as pedagogical vehicles for developing systemic habits of life at the core of systemic profiles that students need to develop. These profiles, like those of accomplished experts in different disciplines and fields, should ultimately turn into 4P profiles characterized with the four cross-cutting traits of progressive minds, productive habits, profound episteme, and principled conduct.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive biases and heuristics are pervasive simplifications and distortions in judgement and reasoning that systematically affect human decision making. Knowledge in this area may enable Defense to foresee and reduce detrimental effects of biases and to influence others more effectively. In a literature study we assessed the influence of personal characteristics (cognitive abilities, expertise, personality, cultural background), mental states (mood, emotions, stress, attention, expectations) and external factors (e.g., information availability, time constraints, physical discomfort) on the occurrence of cognitive biases. We found that each of the aforementioned factors can affect cognitive biases, though little is known about the effects of culture. Factors that appear to reduce a cognitive bias may in fact suppress or override its behavioral effect rather than preventing the bias from occurring at all. Bias susceptibility and the occurrence of biases depend on thinking style (heuristic versus analytical), where thinking style is associated with an individual’s personal characteristics, mental state and external factors. In general, biases are reduced when an analytical thinking style is applied. However, whether a specific thinking style reduces or enhances a given bias also depends on the context. Finally, we provide some results on debiasing techniques and link our findings to military practice.",

Our recognition of the conceptual-methodological unfeasibility of the common-sense foundation of psychology raises the necessity of developing a theory of intervention that considers the psychologist’s actions as belonging to the in-between zone: while everyday life is based on common sense, the science of psychology and its practices transcend that very common sense. The relationship between general psychological knowledge and the concrete situatedness of psychologists’ practice gives the discipline a number of tension points: (a) the social construction of the client’s requests at the intersection of practical interests, general knowledge, and local social expectations; (b) how one can interpret current psychological knowledge for the grounding of professional use; and (c) the tension between the scientific knowledge and the client’s practical interest in turning to get help from psychologists. The epistemological and conceptual implications of these tension points are outlined, showing how a careful analysis of psychology as practical profession can contribute to the theoretical development of psychology.",

In such cases labeling and management instead of authentic human relationships becomes the life strategy, making the individual extremely vulnerable to the status of psychiatric patient or absolutely intolerable to mentally ill in the society. The subjective meaning of the illness can be just a crisis, a transitional state, way of life or an imprescriptible part of identity. Self-stigmatization is generally defined as the patients reaction to illness and the attitude to mentally ill in the society. The patient's personality makes him sensitive to the stigma, by identity deficit as well as his surrounding, bringing about the change in his relationship system, taking into account the conception of his illness. In the treatment process it is very important to consider which life spheres and to what extent are involved. The hole in the identity can be filled with this self-labeling as the representative of the definite illness group, realizing the ambivalent motivational strategies.

      "abstract": "Abstract It is widely accepted that evidence-based practice should be a requirement for healthcare delivery. Ironically, the same rule is almost routinely flouted when dealing with issues of instructional design in medical education. Instead of basing instructional procedures on theories and hypotheses empirically tested using randomized, controlled experiments, instructional procedures tend to be introduced based on intuition rather than theory and either never tested for relative effectiveness or tested years or decades after their introduction. The consequence can be instruction that is random in its effectiveness and frequently worse than the procedures it may have replaced. The present chapter discusses instructional design from a cognitive load theory perspective. Cognitive load theory categorizes knowledge areas in terms of the extent to which humans have evolved to acquire those areas. The theory also considers human cognitive architecture from an evolutionary perspective, in that the information processing characteristics of human cognition are considered analogously to the information processing characteristics of evolution by natural selection. An emphasis is placed on humans’ large long-term memory; the procedures used to efficiently acquire knowledge held in long-term memory; how we create new knowledge during problem solving; the role of a limited working memory during instruction; and lastly the lifting of working memory limits when dealing with familiar information stored in long-term memory. This theory has been used to generate a range of instructional hypotheses, with each hypothesis tested using randomized, controlled trials. The result is a series of cognitive load effects that can be used to guide instructional design.",

Learning is something that happens within the individual and involves specific biological qualities which the human species has acquired over thousands of years.

      "abstract": "The article considers the influence of cognitive styles and individual features of perception and coding information on teaching geometry. Cognitive styles can determine success in learning, as they are manifested in the individual characteristics of the cognitive processes of students, their ways of perception, thinking, and action. Special attention is paid to the problems of connection of cognitive styles with interhemispheric brain asymmetry, level of intelligence, and motivation of a personality. The article underlines a very important for the learning process individual characteristic of a student. It is ‘differentiation of the field’, which means the influence of differences of the external environment on human decision-making. Differentiation of the field is described in terms of field dependence – field independence. Field dependence as a cognitive style means dominance of the whole, a lack of differentiation of parts in an image of perception, a disability to overcome the context, to select separate stimuli from the background. Field independence is an ability to resist the influence of conflicting background signs in the perception of visual forms and ties, an ability to perceive the whole, to allocate parts from complex figures, to choose stimuli from a context. In the conducted experimental research there were offered examples of tasks that allow to form cognitive ‘flexibility’ and overcome difficulties of students in analyzing geometric problems text. There were highlighted types of such tasks that were characterized by an educational effect. The conclusions from the experiment show that taking into account the parameters of cognitive styles with regular use of the system of developed tasks has a positive impact on the achievement of subject results in teaching students. The analysis of scientific and educational literature was carried out in order to make the understanding of the categories in this insufficiently researched area available to a wide range of school teachers.",

Therefore, it is necessary to address this thought’s structure through its cognitive processes to obtain an operational definition that allows this thought’s pedagogy to be adequately addressed in the classroom, regardless its development source. In this article, five processes inherent to this thought are determined, identifying only those that are always used. These processes are operatively defined from a psychological and a pedagogical perspective. The processes are abstraction, generalization, evaluation, creation of algorithms and decomposition of the problem. The first four processes present an inherent relation to problem-solving that can be verified, while, the last one, decomposition, can be considered not fundamental in problem solving and, therefore, linked to computational thinking. The performed analysis and categorization prove that decomposition is the key and central process of computational thinking. Therefore, computational thinking teaching must always be approached from the decomposition of problems or tasks that allow the simplification of the rest of the processes involved. This should involve different resources such as programming, playing games, problem-solving, or the creation of projects.",

      "title": "The role of the need for cognition in coping with difficulties – research review",
      "abstract": "The need for cognition is associated primarily with the functioning of the cognitive sphere, motivation to engage in intellectual tasks, inquisitiveness and curiosity. Meanwhile, researchers indicate that it can also affect human life in other areas. The need for cognition transpires to be a tendency to cognitive effort not only in terms of intellectual tasks, but also in interpersonal situations and emotionally demanding situations. The article presents a description of this variable, its correlates as well as the specificity of the functioning of people with a high need for cognition. Studies showing the importance of the need for cognition for the functioning of an individual in interpersonal relationships and for coping with difficult situations have been compiled. The relationship between the need for cognition and human emotionality and its importance as a resource in human life have been emphasized.",

      "title": "Autodeterminación en personas con discapacidad intelectual que envejecen y algunas variables que inciden en su desarrollo",
      "abstract": "Self-determination is a key construct to guarantee the development of skills that enable people with disabilities to acquire control over their lives. This concept is understood as a set of volitional actions or abilities that help the person to act as the primary causal agent in their own life without unnecessary external influences. Progressively, this construct has been shaped as a personal disposition to exercise control over one's own behavior, becoming a priority educational goal and an indicator of quality of life in the field of intellectual disability. However, people with intellectual disabilities have premature aging processes generally accompanied by mental health disorders or emotional problems that hinder the performance of self-determination skills. Specifically, they have difficulties in developing actions aimed at promoting positive attributions of effectiveness or aimed at establishing personal goals. This complicates the acquisition of skills for self-regulation and the increase of personal empowerment skills. This study seeks to know the self-determination levels of 516 aging adults with intellectual disabilities aged between 45 and 86 years (M = 68.32; S = 4.95). Most of them live in the Metropolitan Region (Chile), have severe intellectual disabilities, are men and live with the family. From a quantitative approach and under an inclusive research model, the data have been collected using an ad hoc scale as a result of the revision of the ARC-INICO Self-determination Assessment Scale (Verdugo et al., 2015) and the Self-determination Scale ARC staff (Wehmeyer, 1995). The results have been analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics that have preceded the use of parametric statistics. The self-determination levels of the majority of the participants (39.1 %) are in a low range. In addition, the development of competencies related to self-defense or self-knowledge are greatly diminished, unlike other skills such as making choices or solving problems. Likewise, the analysis shows how those participants who reside in the family home present higher averages in their self-determination than those who live outside the family home. Similarly, participants with mental health disorders have lower averages in their self-determination than those who do not present these pathologies. Regarding the degree of disability, the levels of self-determination of the mild group are higher than those of the group of adults with severe intellectual disability. Those who most often have family support have higher levels of self-determination than those who receive only professional support. With regard to age, the youngest participants have higher averages than the rest in terms of their self-determination. The discussion highlights, among others, the need to prioritize the learning of skills related to self-realization as the basis of the proposals for intervention in self-determination at this stage of life. The results suggest some implications to consider for the planning of interventions, for example, they should seek the development of skills that strengthen the self-defense capacity of people with intellectual disabilities, promote the increase of opportunities for the realization of meaningful choices, adapt to the scenarios in which aging people with intellectual disabilities usually operate, and involve families and professionals to achieve skills related to self-determination in old age. Despite the fact that one of the main limitations of this research is that the results are not generalizable, this study contributes to enriching the bulk of research on self-determination in late adulthood, this being an aspect barely addressed in the literature. In addition, it suggests the development of future lines of research related to the impact of technological supports on the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities who age or with the study of cognitive impairment or the presence of mental health disorders in the levels of self-determination of these people. https://doi.org/10.16888/interd.2021.38.3.8",

The field includes mental health, performance consultation/coaching, and academia. Ethics overlap with laws which vary depending on the state, territory, or country where the practitioner is licensed or registered. Common wisdom dictates that practitioners must abide by the most stringent ethical standards. This chapter highlights some key commonalities across different codes, as they apply to practitioners. Core issues to sport psychology include competence and representation; beneficence vs. nonmaleficence; multiple relationships and boundaries; assessment; informed consent and confidentiality; technology, documentation, and risk management; decision-making models; self-care; and diversity and cultural competency. International Society for Sport Psychology's standards expand on the importance of competence, stating that practitioners \"must only provide services and accept employment within the boundaries of their competence based on education, training, experience, state and national professional credentials\".",

      "title": "Conceptualising Lived Experience in Mental Health Research: Problems, Insights and Implications",
      "abstract": "Across health research, drawing on accounts from people with lived experience is often promoted as a shift away from epistemic injustice wherein the knowledge of the marginalised is ignored/silenced. Paradoxically for people with mental distress who are given a diagnostic label, aspects of their accounts may actually be foregrounded to categorise them with mental illness/disorder. In doing this, their sense of reality (e.g., ontological experiences) can be judged to be significantly different from other people in addition to their epistemic knowledge and understanding. This points to issues of ontological differences between lived experiencers of various forms of mental distress that need deeper consideration in mental health research and practice, alongside the ongoing work on epistemic considerations. Experiencing serious mental distress can include a loss of trust in one's sensory/perceptual signals which complicates how one makes sense of experience and knowledge. The complexities around these processes is at odds with the more straightforward ideas about testimonial accuracy and speaker credibility that underpin epistemic knowledge goals. This review outlines often-overlooked issues related to ontological differences between people in the context of mental health and offers suggestions for the future.",

      "title": "A theoretical framework for understanding the importance of implementing simulation in social work education",
      "abstract": "Social work engages in many complex and emotionally charged environments that challenge the educational requirements of students. The profession draws on various theories, including sociology, psychology, and political sciences to inform understandings of power, oppression, structural injustice, and complex lived experiences. However, contributions from psychological science are important in understanding how students develop the necessary cognitive function needed to handle complex situations, thereby providing a blueprint for ways of teaching and learning. Theories of learning and cognition can be utilized to understand how people develop the capacity to perceive, process, store, and act upon complex information. This paper investigates a theoretical model that social worker educators can use to understand how individuals draw upon learning to frame their understanding for future practice. Memory is a key feature in how students process, learn and adapt to new information within their environment, playing a pivotal role in learning and teaching. By harnessing cognitive load theory, simulation pedagogy can draw on memory as a defining ingredient in practice skill development and complex decision making. Thus, providing a theoretical framework for inclusion of simulation within social work education, protecting vulnerable service users, equipping students for placement and upholding the professional integrity of social work.",

To do this, autobiographical memories of wisdom-fostering life events were examined for (a) life-event characteristics, and (b) self-reflective processes believed to support growth in wisdom through life experience.Midlife adults (N = 482) provided a written autobiographical memory of a wisdom-fostering life event. Memories were content analyzed by expert coders for life-event characteristics (i.e., fundamentality, emotional valence, cultural normativity, and specific event types) and self-reflective processes (i.e., narrative coherence, meaning-making, and personal growth). Participants also completed self-report and performance measures of wisdom.Wisdom-fostering life events tended to be fundamental to life, culturally non-normative, and emotionally negative. Participants frequently reported developing wisdom from relationship events (e.g., interpersonal conflict, divorce) and life-threatening/mortality events (e.g., death, serious illness). Wisdom was positively associated with reconstructive (i.e., narrative coherence) and analytical (i.e., meaning-making, personal growth) components of self-reflection. Self-reflective processes varied as a function of life-event characteristics.This study emphasizes the role of both persons and environments in the development of wisdom, and highlights the importance of self-reflection as a mechanism through which wisdom is constructed from life experience.",

      "title": "Boundary Problems: Reclaiming Thought Space in the Attention Economy",
      "abstract": "There is far less opportunity for thought that is not in some way mediated than there once was, and often this is by design. Cognitive engineers ply vast resources to attract and retain our attention toward what are ultimately commercial ends. They use pervasive and spatially unbound mediating technologies to gain access to every space in our lives. In this information superabundance, the act of filtering desirable content induces such a cognitive load that we are left with noticeably altered brains—eroded attention spans, failing memories, diminished executive function and complex reasoning skills, etc. These lead to a host of issues relating to health and wellbeing including sleep deficiencies, social isolation, depression and anxiety. In light of the pressures of this new attention economy, what role does architecture have to play in the reclamation of thought-space and embodied experience in contemporary life, particularly in the home? This paper will present some preliminary design ideas for dwellings that address the attention economy, drawing boundaries around behavior-altering technologies in order to foster long-term desires for health, mental clarity, focus, restfulness, and social connection rather than the typical focus on immediate comfort. This is not a Luddite plea to leave these advancing technologies behind, but a humanist plea to find the boundaries in which we can thrive while using them.",

      "title": "The Prospects and Challenges of Measuring Morality",
      "abstract": "The scientific study of morality requires measurement tools. But can we measure individual differences in something so seemingly subjective, elusive, and difficult to define? This paper will consider the prospects and challenges—both practical and ethical—of measuring how moral a person is. We outline the conceptual requirements for measuring general morality and argue that it would be difficult to operationalize morality in a way that satisfies these requirements. Even if we were able to surmount these conceptual challenges, self-report, informant report, behavioral, and biological measures each have methodological limitations that would substantially undermine their validity or feasibility. These challenges will make it more difficult to develop valid measures of general morality than other psychological traits. But, even if a general measure of morality is not feasible, it does not follow that moral psychological phenomena cannot or should not be measured at all. Instead, there is more promise in developing measures of specific operationalizations of morality (e.g., commonsense morality), specific manifestations of morality (e.g., specific virtues or behaviors), and other aspects of moral functioning that do not necessarily reflect moral goodness (e.g., moral self-perceptions). Still, it is important to be transparent and intellectually humble about what we can and cannot conclude based on various moral assessments—especially given the potential for misuse or misinterpretation of value-laden, contestable, and imperfect measures. Finally, we outline recommendations and future directions for psychological and philosophical inquiry into the development and use of morality measures.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Computer games that teach cybersecurity concepts have been developed to help both individuals and organizations shore up their defence against cybercrimes. Evidence of the effectiveness of these games has been rather weak, however. This paper aims to guide the design and testing of more effective cybersecurity educational games by developing a theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature is conducted to explore the dependent variable of this research stream, learning outcomes and its relationship with four independent variables, game characteristics, game context, learning theory and user characteristics. Findings The dependent variable can be measured by five learning outcomes: information, content, strategic knowledge, eagerness to learn/time spent and behavioral change. Game characteristics refer to features that contribute to a game’s usefulness, interactivity, playfulness or attractiveness. Game context pertains to factors that determine how a game is used, including the target audience, the skill involved and the story. Learning theory explains how learning takes place and can be classified as behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, social learning or constructivism. User characteristics including gender, age, computer experience, knowledge and perception, are attributes that can impact users’ susceptibility to cybercrimes and hence learning outcomes. Originality/value The framework facilitates taking stock of past research and guiding future research. The use of the framework is illustrated in a critique of two research streams. Multiple research directions are discussed for continued research into the design and testing of next-generation cybersecurity computer games.",

      "abstract": "Research provides some observations about learning from events that appear to be rare or quite unusual. All learning has uncertain consequences, but learning from rare events is especially problematic. Learners see many idiosyncrasies and exogenous interference, tendencies that suppress learning on an organizational scale. Rare events also rouse uncertainty and bring on reactions to uncertainty such as wishful thinking, reliance on prior beliefs, biased probabilities, a search for more data, cautious action, and playing to audiences. The most important contingencies affecting these reactions are the content and strength of prior beliefs: people are unlikely to learn if they think they have nothing to learn. Although learning from rare events is statistically unusual, and effective learning from rare events is rare, both individuals and organizations can benefit significantly from active efforts to learn from rare events.",

Instead, as in all sciences, we need to build on the knowledge gained from the lessons learned in order to make informed decisions in educating small preschoolers.Lithuania has already been adapting foreign practices aimed at the social and emotional development of children, but not all of them. Only a few percent of educational institutions follow them, as educators themselves do not have enough knowledge to develop children‘s emotional abilities. B. Elkjaer (2009) claims that experience is primarily related not to knowledge but to human life as a process. Human life is a continuous relationship between the human and the environment. This relationship has the same importance and meaning as an experience, but it also includes emotions, aesthetics, ethics and knowledge. When one is seeking to obtain knowledge, experience is not enough. Essential learning, according to R. Usher (2009), is based on practicing the way or style of life. This claim rejects the idea that learning originates from the experience. Nevertheless, experience and learning are interrelated, interactive and dynamic processes. Taking these issues into consideration, the following research question is suggested: How do teachers integrate the development of children’s emotional intelligence into practical activities when planning the educational process?[...]",

It is a crucial trait that integrates mental and physical energies, focusing them towards achieving goals. Without self-confidence, even the most knowledgeable and skilled individuals may struggle to succeed. Self-confidence is more than just a trait; it is a positive and realistic perception of one's abilities, often reflected through attributes like assertiveness, optimism, and emotional maturity. Importantly, confidence is learned rather than inherited and can be influenced by past experiences, such as childhood criticism or significant losses. While a lack of confidence can persist if not addressed, it is possible to cultivate it through self-awareness and skill development.

      "abstract": "Both the constraining and enabling forces of attention load interact when decision-makers solve complex problems effectively. Synthesizing strands of educational, cognitive psychology, as well as organization research, we develop a conceptual process framework. It explains the ways in which extrinsic, intrinsic, and germane attention load dynamics shape attention capacity which is necessary for developing a mental model of the problem. In particular, the paper adds internal and external context elements –problem characteristics, frames and support- that influence how attention load unfolds within the problem-solving process. Contributions are intended to be made to attention, problem-solving and decision-making literatures, and to current efforts at making bounded rationality assumptions more humanistic.",

      "title": "Adaptation in aphasia: revisiting language evidence",
      "abstract": "Background: Humans adapt to constantly changing internal and external conditions to meet survival needs. Persons with aphasia (PWA) are faced with changes in their physiological, cognitive, and affective state. They usually have physiological impairments in the frontal or temporal areas, which can lead to cognitive problems such as limited working memory, inefficient executive function, and lapse of attention. These problems have negative impacts on their language. Most PWA also experience long-term social anxiety, pressure, and other negative feelings caused by their illness. According to adaptation theory, symptoms such as omission and disfluency are not caused by deficits in language knowledge but by adaptive behaviours that PWA produce because of certain communicative purposes or the severity of aphasia.Aims: The purpose of this paper is to review the theories and facts concerning the adaptive language behaviours of PWA and to attempt to account for the features, motivations, and principles of their strategic, adaptive language.Main Contribution: To adapt to the heterogeneous concomitant cognitive and psychological impairment induced by aphasia, PWA must maximise their expression by efficiently exploiting their resources (i.e., performing normal communication in the most effortless way) following the principle of economy, which is a basic human cognitive principle. PWA employ several strategies to maintain crucial information and avoid effortful, less necessary language elements. They sometimes seek non-verbal strategies to compensate for what cannot be expressed. In this way, PWA are able to transmit information and simultaneously avoid embarrassment caused by erroneous language.Conclusions: This type of economic language use can be observed in phonology, morphology, syntax, and other levels of language. PWA's adaptation should be taken into consideration when considering their language, so that it can be differentiated from language disorders caused by other cognitive impairments or competence loss. Sometimes language deficits are only symptoms of adaption rather than the result of impairments. Psychosocial interventions should be included in recovery programmes so that PWA can adapt in a more positive way and make full use of their language potential.",

Given the universality of death, death anxiety is a common emotional reaction that occurs across the lifespan. Theorists have viewed death anxiety from several perspectives, from a failure of the denial defense mechanism (e.g., the inability to reject the inevitability of death) to issues related to self‐esteem, regret, and the successful resolution of life stages. For some individuals, death anxiety can be problematic and can impact emotional, physical, and social well‐being.

Practice has changed a great deal over the past century, in response to evolving conceptions of knowledge and its acquisition, views of schooling and its purposes, and technologies for gathering and evaluating response data. Conceptions of what constitutes assessment data, how it should be interpreted, and what kind of inferences are to be drawn can differ radically under different psychological perspectives. We see greater continuity, however, when we distinguish the structure of assessment arguments from their substance. Developments here have been more in the nature of extensions, elaborations, and refinements, as they have been prompted by changes in culture and substance.",

The academic efforts that have been made to synthesize differing approaches to psychotherapy have not met with widespread acceptance. Part of the reason why such a synthesis has been slow in coming may be found in the stages of development the practitioner goes through in learning psychotherapy. The concepts of developmental psychology discussed by Chandler (7) in describing the adolescent's confrontation with relativism and \"epistemological loneliness\" can help us understand some of the cognitive problems faced by the psychiatry resident. Unfortunately, most residents choose one particular approach to psychotherapy during training, and adhere to that method throughout their professional careers. The philosophical approach of \"pluralism\" describes a less limiting solution to the problem of differing world views, and may provide a model for a more integrated approach to psychotherapy.",

Of these, internet‐based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is the most well‐investigated format. There have been more than 60 controlled studies on ICBT, and it has been shown that when guidance is provided, ICBT can be as effective as face‐to‐face psychotherapy. A therapeutic alliance is formed in ICBT with the internet therapist, but it is unclear if specific therapist skills are needed or if administrative support is enough. Guided ICBT has been developed and tested for a range of problems, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and health problems such as chronic pain. Challenges faced include negative attitudes towards computerized psychotherapy and dissemination.",

Nous developpons dans une periode relativement courte un toute etonnable nombre d’habilites motrices, de locomotion jusqu'a manipulation qui requierent une motricite globale ou fine. Le developpement moteur emerge de l’interaction avec l’environnement qui exerce des contraintes mais offre egalement des modeles pour l’apprentissage par imitation. Notre capacite a appliquer les principes de coordination a de nouvelles habiletes motrices nous ouvre un vaste champ de possibilites. A noter que certaines habiletes motrices, telles que l’ecriture, necessitent, elles, un apprentissage et un entrainement specifiques. Chez certains enfants, les habiletes motrices ne se developpent pas de facon appropriee. Ces enfants eprouvent des difficultes dans l’apprentissage des habiletes motrices et sont maladroits dans leur mise en œuvre. Il en resulte un retard du developpement moteur. Pour nombre de ces enfants, aucune etiologie d’ordre medical ou neurologique ne peut etre trouvee. Ils sont diagnostiques comme atteints d’un Trouble d’Acquisition des Coordinations (TAC) et sont l’objet de ce livre. Ce trouble est designe sous diverses appellations telles que la maladresse, la dyspraxie ou difficultes d’integration sensori-motrice. Cet ouvrage a pour objectif d’informer le lecteur – qu’il soit professionnel, chercheur, enseignant ou parent - des derniers acquis de la recherche portant sur le TAC. Il passe en revue les difficultes rencontres par l’enfant souffrant d’un TAC (Geuze), les principaux tests disponibles dans le domaine des fonctions perceptivo-motrices (Albaret & Castelnau), les differents sous-types et la comorbidite (Visser), les deficits sous-jacents au TAC (Wilson & Butson), les principales approches therapeutiques et leur efficacite (Polatajko & Cantin), et enfin, la prise en charge du TAC (Sugden). Cet ouvrage souhaite favoriser la diffusion des connaissances scientifiques actuelles ainsi que l’utilisation des outils appropries pour le diagnostic, l’evaluation et le traitement du TAC. L’objectif ultime est le developpement optimal – non limite au seul developpement moteur – de l’enfant atteint d’un TAC, ce qui constitue une gageure pour les parents, les enseignants et les professionnels concernes.

Thinking may involve perceiving information, processing information, and applying information. The term cognitive style is used to refer to a person's habitual way of learning or teaching. The term cognitive style is synonymous with thinking style as are the terms decision‐making style , problem‐solving style , learning style , mind style , perceptual style , and conceptual tempo . Cognitive style differs from intellectual ability. Cognitive style refers to one's manner of performing, whereas intellectual ability refers to one's level of performance. Researchers believe that an individual's cognitive style is consistent over time; however, it may vary across situational contexts. For example, an individual may use one cognitive style the majority of the time, but use a different cognitive style to solve a particular problem or to handle a social situation.",

The research of human intelligence includes a broad range of theories and a variety ofdifferent answers regarding most of the fundamental questions in the field, including thefollowing questions: What is the nature of intelligence? Is it a constant innate cognitive traitor is it a skill that can be improved? Is intelligence a single uniform entity or is it amultiplicity of independent abilities? What is the intelligence that most influences the degreeof success and in what fields?. The responses of most of the researchers depend largely on thetype of intelligence studied, as a result of a variety of approaches and schools –developmental, cognitive, psychometric, emotional-social, practical, and so on. In contrast,the starting point of this study is the success itself, with the goal to examine whether there isone ability that is shared by all those who succeed over time and whether and how it can beimproved - Since on the one hand, people with completely different abilities succeed inattaining significant achievements and on the other hand, only some people with similarabilities achieve lasting success. The main conclusion as examined during a decade ofcounseling and support of more than five hundred different people is that all those whoachieve ongoing success have a good level of ability in results-focused self-management –and this is results intelligence. The study shows that every individual has a different profile ofintelligences that includes his main abilities – and results intelligence is the ability to manageall the other abilities in favor of the achievement of the maximum results of success desiredover time. Since results intelligence is fundamentally a management ability and managementaddresses ways of thinking and doing and includes the ability to plan and implement a varietyof actions so as to achieve different goals, it exists in everybody, even if at different levels ofawareness, skill, or maximization. On the basis of the theory of management by objectivesfrom the approach of Professor Peter Drucker (as presented in the continuation) in life, as inbusiness, management is the factor that most influences the degree of success over time – andmanagement can be learned. Thus, it is possible to learn how to develop the level of resultsintelligence and thus to significantly improve the chances of reaching the maximum ofsuccess in a variety of areas of life. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create the modelof the development of results intelligence so as to enable individuals to identify their mainabilities and to learn how to leverage them and manage themselves, for the benefit of theachievement of their desired success and goals.",

Also, at these ages individuals may develop various forms of theory of mind deficits. They may encounter difficulties with reading facial expressions and recognizing other people’s emotions. It becomes harder for them to recognize negative emotions (such as sorrow, fear, anger) than positive ones (joy).

The Menningers in Topeka, although very psychoanalytically oriented, expanded several of the ideas of milieu therapy. Milieus can be set up following eclectic, psychoanalytic, behavioral, educational, social learning, or social-psychological principles. Authoritarianism, defensiveness, rejection, criticism, and judgmental behavior are characteristics which are probably antithetical to the therapeutic relationship. All therapeutic systems present some rationale to participants. The rationale covers two aspects: An explanation, diagnosis or description of the problem allows it to be named, categorized, or concretized in some way and some prescription is offered as to what types of things need to be done in order to change have surgery, get more training or education, or develop self-understanding.",

From literature review, maladaptive coping strategies include rumination, disengagement, expressive suppression, avoidant coping, denial and substance abuse, social withdrawal, and eating disorder behaviors. It is recommended that the universities should adopt cognitive behavior therapy techniques to assist the students who are involved in maladaptive coping strategies to stress.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is closely interrelated with several cognitive processes, as well as metacognitive executive processes. There is strong evidence from several studies that WM, more than any other cognitive factor except fluid reasoning, may account for individual differences in general intelligence. Fluid reasoning is the ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems, particularly when confronted with a novel task or unfamiliar situation. Several studies have found extremely high correlations between fluid reasoning and WM capacity. Executive functions include mental processes responsible for cuing, directing, and coordinating multiple aspects of perception, cognition, emotion, and behavior during purposeful, goal-directed, problem-solving behavior. Nearly all experts in executive functions agree that WM is one of the executive functions. Attention is a complex, multifaceted psychological process that influences cognition, learning, behavior, and performance. Learning and the efficiency of cognitive operations, such as WM, require adequate attentional capacity and control.",

Su impacto afecta la vida personal, profesional y social de quienes lo padecen. El objetivo de este trabajo es identificar sus causas, consecuencias y las estrategias de afrontamiento que pueden ayudar a prevenirlo. Para la búsqueda de información se consultó la base de datos web of science y para el análisis el programa Atlas ti v8. Se encontró que en la actualidad las constantes y crecientes demandas y expectativas hacia los docentes es un detonante del síndrome. La reducción de prestaciones, la falta de reconocimiento, el bajo salario, un ambiente laboral tóxico y el conflicto para separar la vida personal de la laboral son otras de las causas. Como factor de prevencion se encontró que la inteligencia emocional es efectiva. Otras estrategias de afrontamiento que pueden ayudar a reducir el burnout son la práctica de la meditación, la lectura y la escritura, tener contacto con la naturaleza, dormir de 7 a 8 horas de manera diaria y reir.",

Without the knowledge and skills needed to appropriately address referral questions and serve consumers of neuropsychological services, the remaining ethical requirements are largely irrelevant. Put more plainly, if we do not know what we are doing, we should not be engaging in professional activities. For example, in the absence of competence to provide neuropsychological services, issues such as test selection, informed consent, and confidentiality should not come into play because we should not be engaging in neuropsychological activities in the first place. Conversely, practicing in accordance with other ethical standards is essential for competence. For example, one must understand and apply appropriate methods of test selection, informed consent, and confidentiality to provide competent services. Although this issue is straightforward when considered in the abstract as the dichotomous competence versus incompetence, in most clinical situations the required knowledge and skill set needed to provide a specific service in a certain context is not always obvious.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation started its academic career in the 1970s within behavioral medicine and mind-body research. Now, you find it in psychotherapy, neuroscience and clinical psychology, but also increasingly in the social sciences such as education, organization studies, social work and economics. Mindfulness meditation is offered as a secular program for healing, self-understanding and growth, and has moved from the cultural margins (Buddhism) to the mainstream, both scientifically and culturally. The variety of problems that mindfulness addresses is made possible by the fact that it actually spans both the pathological and the normal or healthy. In actual fact, it collapses that distinction regularly. By introducing readers, listeners or viewers to a mind that is “mindless” in its normal state – running on autopilot, being lost in thought, always in a doingmode – it simultaneously pathologizes people’s normal mode of functioning. Mindfulness proponents claim to work with universal and transdiagnostic processes, which underpin both health and sickness. Hence, anyone endowed with a mind benefits from mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness has been able to connect to and makes sense of collectively experienced societal changes, and offers scientifically grounded (albeit patchy) guidance on how to relate to these. The initial focus on stress related problems, evident in the name of its first medical institution – The stress reduction clinic – resonated with growing societal concerns over the downsides of multitasking and “workaholism” in the 1980s, 1990s and onwards.",

This chapter reviews the literature regarding the impact of such effects on HRQoL assessment. This is a rapidly changing field, and we make no pretence of having carried out a formal systematic review – but we believe that the conclusions faithfully represent current knowledge on this subject.",

      "title": "Better Than Conscious?",
      "abstract": "Experts discuss the implications of the ways humans reach decisions through the conscious and subconscious processing of information. Conscious control enables human decision makers to override routines, to exercise willpower, to find innovative solutions, to learn by instruction, to decide collectively, and to justify their choices. These and many more advantages, however, come at a price: the ability to process information consciously is severely limited and conscious decision makers are liable to hundreds of biases. Measured against the norms of rational choice theory, conscious decision makers perform poorly. But if people forego conscious control, in appropriate tasks, they perform surprisingly better: they handle vast amounts of information; they update prior information; they find appropriate solutions to ill-defined problems. This inaugural Strüngmann Forum Report explores the human ability to make decisions, consciously as well as without conscious control. It explores decision-making strategies, including deliberate and intuitive; explicit and implicit; processing information serially and in parallel, with a general-purpose apparatus, or with task-specific neural subsystems. The analysis is at four levels—neural, psychological, evolutionary, and institutional—and the discussion is extended to the definition of social problems and the design of better institutional interventions. The results presented differ greatly from what could be expected under standard rational choice theory and deviate even more from the alternate behavioral view of institutions. New challenges emerge (for example, the issue of free will) and some purported social problems almost disappear if one adopts a more adequate model of human decision making.",

As a Muslim Engineer, accountability to our Creator, accountability and responsibility to the society, environments and the non-human nature cannot be separated from the profession. Accountability and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, infact, they occur simultaneously in many instances, for Example, I TAKE responsibility and I am HELD accountable.

It determines a healthcare professional's ability to function effectively under stress, quickly adapt to changing circumstances, and provide quality medical care, which is extremely important in today's conditions of full-scale war. The article aims to analyse the psychological readiness of future healthcare professionals for professional activity through emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions and identify the key factors that contribute to its formation. The article proposes a comprehensive approach to the psychological readiness of future healthcare professionals, which integrates emotional stability, cognitive competencies and social skills as key elements. The significance of each of these components in the context of modern challenges, such as stressful working conditions and increasing professional demands, is revealed, and the important role of psychological stability, self-awareness and emotional and volitional qualities in forming psychological readiness is determined. Particular attention is paid to the gradual formation of psychological readiness, starting from the stage of study, adaptation to the educational environment, formation of professional identity and integration into real professional activity. The main characteristics of these stages are outlined, along with the aspects requiring development at each stage. Emphasis is placed on the harmonious development of all components that ensure high professional efficiency among healthcare professionals, even under the challenging conditions of contemporary realities. The results obtained are of practical importance for developing training programmes for future healthcare professionals to develop their psychological readiness, which, in turn, will improve the quality of healthcare services.",

Aptitudes may be physical or mental, and are not developed knowledge, understanding, learned or acquired abilities, skills or attitudes: they spring from heredity or endowments. Aptitude and intelligence are related views of assessing human mental ability, when aligned to the theory of multiple intelligences. It is been considered that the individual, who knows his own aptitudes, and their relative strengths, chooses more intelligently among the available opportunities, thus aptitudes have an important impact on motivation to act. In order to elevate the understanding of the managerial and organizational mind as well as cognitive and emotional processes in strategic decision making, we delve into the psychology of strategic management, through the dynamic capabilities view. Since the individual ability or performance is the result of complex interaction between various parts of the mind-body system, we aim to bond the cognitive abilities measured by aptitude assessments, in particular situational and rational, by drawing on the behavioral microfountations of dynamic capabilities in order to sculpt the unique character and strategic posture of the firm. Moreover, we highlight the aptitude drivers embedded it the firm’s intangible resource base, in particular organizational identity, to addresses it’s interrelatedness with capabilities, reputation and strategy. We conceptualize how these intangibles affect the sensemaking in organizations, aiming to gain positions of prominence, and so becoming able to influence the business “rules of the game”.",

Mental models are a scientific psychological construct, which means that people create models of the external world in their minds and operate them to plan their activities. Today, mental models have found application in various fields: explaining the principles of human thinking and solving logical problems, creating models about time, sets, causes and effects, as well as in the field of learning, social relations, teamwork. However, in Russian, the subject of the study of mental models is practically not presented. Purpose. To examine works devoted to the study of mental models in various fields of psychology. Mental models in the field of thinking process research . A leading expert in the field of human thinking mechanisms P. N. Johnson-Laird put forward and substantiated idea, that in the process of reasoning, people actively create mental models that accompany logical operations and can influence them. Mental models are iconic, reflecting the meaning of objects of the external world, are deployed in a sequence corresponding to external events, and reflect external operations schematically. Mental models in learning. Mental models can be useful tools for constructing the educational process. Understanding and competent use of the natural mechanisms of the psyche of students can improve the process of modeling their knowledge of the world around them. Mental models in socio-psychological processes . The interaction of an individual with other people generates the process of forming their reflections in the internal space, creating models of behavior and possible reactions of others. In team interaction, an important factor in the effectiveness and viability of the team is the presence of common (team) mental models. Discussion . The use of the concept of mental models in various fields and a large number of conceptual and empirical works on this topic may indicate the universality of the phenomenon of models. Mental models as an explanatory principle are built into existing theories and enrich them.",

In this inclusive study, we aimed to understand how adults with intellectual disabilities perceive independence, including their definitions, the possibilities for achieving it, and the needs associated with it. Co-researchers with and without intellectual disabilities conducted individual and focus group interviews with 33 people with intellectual disabilities. Applying reflexive thematic analysis three main themes were generated: Conceptualizing their own independence at present and in the future, Person-specific factors that impact independence, and the need for change. Participants’ perspectives on self-determination reflected the diversity of their experiences related to living conditions, competencies, attitudes of significant others, as well as characteristics arising from the disability itself or associated disorders and conditions. Inclusive design of the study proved an adequate methodology. The added value and implications for practice are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Social cognitive career theory (SCCT) currently consists of 4 overlapping, segmental models aimed at understanding educational and occupational interest development, choice-making, performance and persistence, and satisfaction/well-being. To this point, the theory has emphasized content aspects of career behavior, for instance, prediction of the types of activities, school subjects, or career fields that form the basis for people's educational/vocational interests and choice paths. However, SCCT may also lend itself to study of many process aspects of career behavior, including such issues as how people manage normative tasks and cope with the myriad challenges involved in career preparation, entry, adjustment, and change, regardless of the specific educational and occupational fields they inhabit. Such a process focus can augment and considerably expand the range of the dependent variables for which SCCT was initially designed. Building on SCCT's existing models, we present a social cognitive model of career self-management and offer examples of the adaptive, process behaviors to which it can be applied (e.g., career decision making/exploration, job searching, career advancement, negotiation of work transitions and multiple roles).",

It is associated with systematic learning strategies that use indicators from several domains, including mind, body, society, and environment. Normally, subjective experiences are considered, as well as objective observations, hence QoL research can be involved in the development of empathic planning and should emphasize qualitative and narrative methods. In principle, QoL assessment emphasizes outcomes, but the value of QoL is often compromised by confusion of means and ends. QoL assessment can involve attention shifts from remedial work to more aspirational planning. It requires realistic attention to cultural relativity and to contextual variety in reference standards, without necessarily compromising on aspirations toward universal standards. The developmental value of QoL learning strategies may derive as much from the learning processes as from the functional uses of the information generated.",

      "abstract": "78Richard E. Snow conceived of individuals' performances as the result of a transaction between their aptitudes and the particular characteristics of the situation in which a performance occurred over time. By aptitudes he meant the cognitive, conative, and affective resources that an individual brings to the situation. By situation he meant the characteristics of a particular environment (e.g., test) that afforded or impeded—that assisted or constrained—certain courses of goal-directed action for different individuals. In relation to achievement tests. Snow proposed that individuals' test performances emerged from the organization of their demographic background and intellectual history; an \"assembly\" of cognitive, conative, and affective processes needed to more or less effectively respond to a series of situation-embedded test tasks (e.g., multiple-choice items); and the ways in which the demand characteristics and opportunities of the tasks were attuned to or mismatched with individuals' aptitude resources. Performance and its determinants were not viewed as static but rather as dynamic processes unfolding over time at the interface of person and situation. From this reasoning and related empirical findings. Snow concluded that a new multivariate approach to validating interpretations of achievement test scores was needed. In this introduction to this special issue, we describe some of Snow's \"big ideas\" regarding issues of aptitude, person-situation transactions, and test validity. We then describe the design of the \"high school study\" we undertook, after Snow's passing in 1997, to explore some of these ideas further.",

L’article aborde cette problématique sous l’angle des stratégies cognitives, en particulier les mécanismes d’attributions causales, qui sont mises en jeu dans les situations qui impliquent une réalisation. Ces stratégies sont constituées de plusieurs processus psychologiques tels que l’anticipation du succès ou de l’échec, l’élaboration de plans d’action liés à la tâche, le recours à des conduites non pertinentes par rapport à la tâche et le biais défensif d’attribution. On résume dans cet article quatre études dont les résultats suggèrent que les jeunes en échec scolaire semblent plutôt mettre en jeu une stratégie d’autohandicap alors que ceux qui, dans une phase ultérieure, de transition de l’adolescence à l’âge adulte ont des difficultés d’insertion mettent en jeu une stratégie encore plus handicapante que nous désignons par «piège de l’échec». En conclusion, nous présentons quelques principes de base destinés à la conception de programmes d’intervention dont l’objectif est d’aider certains jeunes en situation d’exclusion à réussir leur transition vers leur statut d’adultes.",

Les enfants font souvent face a des situations qui les amenent a selectionner une option parmi plusieurs options qui se font concurrence (par ex., terminer ses devoirs avant de jouer ou manger une collation maintenant au lieu de consommer des aliments plus sains lors du repas servi plus tard). Lorsqu’ils prennent de telles decisions, les enfants doivent examiner les options conflictuelles disponibles a la lumiere des attentes et des regles specifiques qu’ils doivent respecter et ils doivent reguler leur impulsion de choisir la gratification immediate au profit d’une option moins immediate et moins automatique. Ce type de controle comportemental et cognitif est lie au concept de fonctions executives. Les fonctions executives referent a des processus de controle cognitif multidimensionnels qui resultent d’un effort volontaire important. Ces fonctions incluent la capacite d’evaluer et d’organiser son environnement, d’atteindre des objectifs et d’adapter son comportement avec flexibilite lors de situations inedites. Des resultats de recherches sur le developpement cognitif et en neuroscience developpementale cognitive ont montre que le developpement de la regulation emotionnelle est fortement tributaire de plusieurs fonctions executives fondamentales, notamment le controle de l’attention, l’inhibition des comportements inappropries, la prise de decisions et d’autres processus cognitifs de haut niveau sollicites dans des contextes exigeants sur le plan affectif.",

This chapter analyses the concept of maths anxiety, a general construct that may have distinct foci, including anxiety around the task of processing numerical concepts and anxiety about situations involving the execution of maths. Its causes may be identified at the individual level (e.g. neuropsychological vulnerability, cognitive readiness, the management of working memory, personality factors), while its development may be exacerbated by environmental factors (e.g. negative school experiences, teacher anxiety, social and cultural factors). Intervention may take the form of adjusting how the subject is taught or presented as well as strategies to modify an individual's attitudes and perceptions. It is possible for schools to lay the basis for \"mathematical resilience\" rather than contributing to negative feelings about the subject.",

Thinking is also a cognitive procedure since it involves considering potential opportunities. There are various types of cognition. Hot cognition involves mental procedures where emotion plays a role, while cold cognition includes mental processes that do not include feelings or emotions. Cognitive memories of various types include sensor memory, sensing touch, smell, and sight; short-term memory allows one to recall, e.g., what one had for lunch a few days ago; working memory includes remembering telephone numbers or directions to a destination; and long-term memory comprises of major milestones in life and recalling one’s childhood events. These are further classified as episodic, e.g., the first day in primary school, and semantic memories, such as recalling the capital city of a country and filling out crossword puzzles. Declarative memories include remembering significant past events, such as global information. Cognition is affected by factors, such as nutrition, aging, addiction, environment, mental health, physical activity, smoking, and keeping the brain active. Consumption of plant- based foods plays a prominent role in the prevention of cognitive memory. Playing games and instruments, reading books, and being socially active make life more satisfying, thus assisting in the preservation of mental function and slowing mental decline.",

      "title": "The role of autonomy in forming an integrated identity among early career academics",
      "abstract": "Abstract The formation of teacher identity is a complex and strenuous process. Teachers are expected to form multiple identities based on institutional values and regulations; however, these identities can sometimes conflict with one's personal values and goals, leading to less integration. According to self‐determination theory, forming an integrated identity is crucial for teachers' well‐being and effective performance. To promote an integrated identity, it is essential to satisfy the need for autonomy, defined in this study as the need to have a choice and the ability to self‐determine one's behaviours. While much is known about the construction of social identity, the formation of an integrated identity is less understood. To fill this gap and support the professional development of early career academics (ECAs), this study adopts the concepts of organismic integration and basic psychological needs. It examines the extent to which ECAs' identity adoption is integrated (autonomous) or introjected (controlled) and the degree to which autonomy satisfaction is associated with adopting particular identities. A total of 176 ECAs teaching at various UK universities completed an online questionnaire based on the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale; 25 of them also participated in a semi‐structured interview. Generally high levels of autonomy satisfaction were determined, but the reasons given indicated the formation of externally regulated and introjected identities. Implications for developing effective professional preparation programmes are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Encoding strategies are significant in determining individual's emotional control and mapping personality traits. The purpose of the present study is to investing association between encoding strategies, personality and emotional factors. This study documents result of responses trom 50 students trom undergraduate and post graduate program using psychological tests namely Neo Five Factor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3), Emotional Intelligence Scale, Verbal Encoding Test and Visual Memory Test. Extroversion and introversion. Self-control (SE) and managing emotions (ME), simultaneous or sequential processing style, verbal encoding and verbal memory were measured. Inferences are drawn on student's preferences to attend to external stimulations versus preference to introspect along with preference to simultaneous visual processing or sequential visual processing. The presence of self-control of emotional responses is an important factor that controls the occurrences of several responses, which possibly will contribute to understanding of conflicts and personality problems. Absence or reduction in sequential processing of signals in verbal and visual modes could weaken rational processing abilities and strengthen holistic processing of relevant and irrelevant issues, which could again pose decision making difficulties. Development of emotional control must occur during the developmental stages and social conditioning plays very important role in deciding the development of such self-control. Present research work can facilitate ground across several domains for further investigations and tries to highlight that there is an acute need to address these problems from neuroscience and social psychology point of view, especially when developments of such controls are minimally present within the social network.",

It looks at the different areas of clinical psychology training, which usually involves: a degree from an approved educational programme, a minimum amount of supervised clinical experience, and passing an examination. Training also requires formal reflection on the integration of science into clinical practice through supervision and personal reflection. Self-care and awareness of the risk factors of compassion fatigue and burnout can help avoid work-related stress in this field. Continuing in clinical psychology requires cognitive attentiveness, emotional resilience, a sustained interest in understanding and alleviating the distress of others, and ongoing education.",

While coping is generally regarded as a desirable technique for ensuring one's well‐being, coping styles can be both healthy and unhealthy. When examining the various forms of coping strategies, researchers and clinicians typically use the two basic categories of problem‐focused and emotion‐focused coping. The term problem‐focused coping refers to strategies for resolving an issue that is generating pain by focusing on altering the source(s) of the stress. In contrast, emotion‐focused coping refers to strategies for reducing the negative emotions linked with an issue or stressor. Baqutayan (2015) describes the subcategories of problem‐focused coping as confrontative responding, social support, and planning and the subcategories of emotion‐focused coping as self‐control, seeking social support, distance, positive appraisal, accepting responsibility, and escape/avoidance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We present a theory of atypical development based on a developmental theory of the typical mind integrating developmental, cognitive, and psychometric theory and research. The paper comprises three parts. First, it outlines the theory of typical development. The theory postulates central cognitive mechanisms, such as relational integration, executive and inferential processes, and domain-specific processes underlying different environmental relations, such as visuospatial or quantitative relations. Cognitive development advances in cycles satisfying developmental priorities in mastering these systems, such as executive control from 2–6 years, inferential control from 7–11 years, and truth control from 12–18 years. Second, we discuss atypical development, showing how each neurodevelopmental disorder emerges from deficiencies in one or more of the processes comprising the architecture of the mind. Deficiencies in relational integration mechanisms, together with deficiencies in social understanding, yield autism spectrum disorder. Deficiencies in executive processes yield attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Deficiencies in symbolic representation yield specialized learning difficulties, such as dyslexia and dyscalculia. Finally, we discuss clinical and educational implications, suggesting the importance of early diagnosis of malfunctioning in each of these dimensions and specific programs for their remediation.",

Psychological well-being is a part of adjustment potential and also reflects the level of adaptation. The most stressful events are death and/or serious illness of close others, or abuse. Special characteristics of students are described in the paper depending on the intensity of their suicidal thoughts.

The theoretical exposure and wider acknowledgement of this layer of active unconscious behaviour, which affects issues of responsibility, has applied effects in many directions. On a larger social scale, the theoretical change in the direction of unconscious choice and decision brings with it a more complex attitude towards social responsibility for one's actions, which have yet to be understood in their full implications. Unconscious responsibility, the concept led into by these considerations, is a term that on its surface seems internally inconsistent and brings its own train of challenges and problems. What seems surprising is the block among psychoanalysts themselves to extending knowledge of the workings of the unconscious into the full range of unconscious activity, evaluating, planning, and executing action.",

      "title": "Metacognition and Reflection by Interdisciplinary Experts: Insights from Cognitive Science and Philosophy",
      "abstract": "Interdisciplinary understanding requires integration of insights from different perspectives, yet it appears questionable whether disciplinary expertsare well prepared for this. Indeed, psychological and cognitive scientific studies suggest that expertise can be disadvantageous because experts are often more biased than non-experts, for example, or fixed on certain approaches, and less flexible in novel situations or situations outside their domain of expertise. An explanation is that experts’ conscious and unconscious cognition and behavior depend upon their learning and acquisition of a set of mental representations or knowledge structures. Compared to beginners in a field, experts have assembled a much larger set of representations that are also more complex, facilitating fast and adequate perception in responding to relevant situations. This article argues how metacognition should be employed in order to mitigate such disadvantages of expertise: By metacognitively monitoring and regulating their own cognitive processes and representations, experts can prepare themselves for interdisciplinary understanding. Interdisciplinary collaboration is further facilitated by team metacognition about the team, tasks, process, goals, and representations developed in the team. Drawing attention to the need for metacognition, the article explains how philosophical reflection on the assumptions involved in different disciplinary perspectives must also be considered in a process complementary to metacognition and not completely overlapping with it. (Disciplinary assumptions are here understood as determining and constraining how the complex mental representations of experts are chunked and structured.) The article concludes with a brief reflection on how the process of Reflective Equilibrium should be added to the processes of metacognition and philosophical reflection in order for experts involved in interdisciplinary collaboration to reach a justifiable and coherent form of interdisciplinary integration. An Appendix of “Prompts or Questions for Metacognition” that can elicit metacognitive knowledge, monitoring, or regulation in individuals or teams is included at the end of the article.",

      "abstract": "A ansiedade matematica (AM) e definida como um tipo de fobia especifica que gera sentimentos de medo, tensao e preocupacao em situacoes onde e exigido um raciocinio numerico ou resolucao de problemas. Um fator de risco consistente para a AM e o baixo desempenho em tarefas aritmeticas. O baixo desempenho pode gerar auto avaliacoes negativas do individuo e, consequentemente reduzir sua autoeficacia. Portanto, as tarefas de matematica seriam associadas ao sentimento de fracasso e isso geraria ansiedade em relacao a disciplina. Assim, como a ansiedade matematica, os mecanismos metacognitivos como a autoeficacia e a autorregulacao tambem sao cruciais para o processo de aprendizagem. Habilidades metacognitivas pobres estao correlacionadas a piores desempenhos academicos. Outro ponto relevante em relacao a ansiedade matematica e seu impacto nas tarefas de memoria de trabalho. Diversos estudos demonstram como individuos com alta ansiedade matematica apresentam piores resultados em tarefas que exigem memoria de trabalho. Deste modo, o presente estudo foi realizado para testar a eficacia de uma intervencao em grupo para reducao da ansiedade matematica e desenvolvimento de estrategias metacognitivas. Tambem foi testada a hipotese de que ha uma melhora no desempenho em tarefas de memoria de trabalho. A amostra contou com 19 adolescentes, entre 12 e 17 anos, com altos niveis de ansiedade matematica. A intervencao foi baseada em tecnicas cognitivo-comportamentais. Os resultados indicam que a amostra foi formada por dois grupos de perfis distintos e, que por isso, a intervencao mostrou resultados na reducao da ansiedade somente para um dos grupos. Porem, nenhum dos grupos apresentou melhora na memoria de trabalho. Em seguida, foi realizado um estudo de caso de um dos participantes da intervencao. Uma adolescente de 16 anos, com inteligencia superior a media e deficits na memoria de trabalho e funcoes executivas. Habilidades como linguagem, habilidades visoespaciais e habilidades numericas basicas preservadas, mas com uma dificuldade persistente na aprendizagem da matematica. Foi investigada a hipotese de que poderia haver algum fator mediador (ansiedade matematica) entre o deficit geral (funcoes executivas) e a aprendizagem da matematica. Apos a intervencao, verificou-se uma melhora estatisticamente significativa na reducao dos niveis de ansiedade e aumento da autoeficacia e da autorregulacao.

      "abstract": "Social norms can enable or limit development. The focus of this paper is on how psychosocial barriers limit functionings and capability development in Mexico. As far as individuals make such barriers their own, they go from being external to being internal; that is, they go beyond being social norms to becoming personal ones. As social norms become personal norms, they can become either barriers or opportunities for change. In fatalistic and tight societies such as Mexico, pressure to conform to “what will happen anyway” and to external norms and expectations is strong. This makes it easier to adopt such barriers than to expand one's functionings and capabilities and thus become an agent of change. In other words, it is more comfortable and practical to continue being a subject rather than an agent of change. The consequence is the apparent and accepted state of affairs of neither oneself nor others enabling the development of personal agency. It is through experiential workshops based on facilitating cognitive, emotional and social skills, and knowledge in health, education, citizenship and productivity that freedoms can be expanded in such a way that psychosocial barriers are reduced and that individuals change behaviors so as to become agents of change.",

To illustrate this perspective, the paper presents two constructive design research cases of designing for self-inclusion. One of these cases presents a finished design to support autistic children in self-inclusion. The other case presents a design exploration method to support participants in determining the emotional priorities which should underlie design interventions. The participants in this case sought to compensate a physical disability, one, a permanent one, and the other, a temporary one. The second case is presented in order to show the potential of starting from the experience of situations rather than specific design goals. The paper concludes that valuable design potential can arise from emotional and experiential insights from combined embodiment and participatory design activities.",

      "abstract": "Organisational motivations grounded on a cross-cultural approach are essential in the analysis of the factors that affect employees' (though different) persistence, volunteerism, and goal-directed actions. Even if there are explanations about drives according to the hierarchy-of-needs approach, the goal-setting theory, and the expectancy paradigm, these are insufficient in establishing the correspondence of several motivational strategies and behavioural patterns with cultural features. Such relationship is made possible by the self-regulatory processes, which come in the form of monitoring, assessing, and responding; and later on, builds the total belief system. Self-observation lets individuals look upon their own experiences, undertakings, and outputs. Self-appraisal involves feedback from significant others, selected social references, and personal reactions. These indicators of an integrative total belief system improve an individuals' self-concept, which affects that person's competence and performance, specifically in an organisational context.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When encountering complex systems, the human mind applies various heuristics, and from these heuristics, mental models—how people understand phenomena in the real world—emerge, which shape their decisions. Unfortunately, the same limitations that confound heuristics similarly cloud people’s mental models and result in fundamental misunderstandings and lead to flawed decisions. The development of models, through the act of modeling, provide means to mitigate inherent shortcomings in people’s cognitive abilities and mental models and can stimulate new ways of understanding and acting in population health, grounded in model thinking. For the study of complex systems in particular, computational simulation modeling approaches enable novel scientific inquiry and facilitate decision-making. Engagement in modeling can also overcome the difficulties in learning imposed by complex systems, leading to transformed mental models and the proliferation of model thinking in population health research and action.",

      "title": "Using cognitive models for behavioral assistance of humans",
      "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive impairments are a rising challenge in society. Everybody has experienced events of forgetting what one was going to do when entering a certain room, or where one has put the keys, the purse or the smartphone. Such problems mostly occur under stress or fatigue. And they may increase with age up to diseases like senile dementia or Alzheimer which affect mental tasks like memory or reasoning, and thus often lead to the need of comprehensive assistance. Due to the societal change, the number of people suffering from such impairments is continuously growing. Cognitive modeling may provide human-centered solutions for this challenge since a cognitive model of a person's behavior, regarding activities of daily living, can serve as a knowledge base for support actions. This paper presents a Domain Specific Modeling Language for Ambient Assistance: The Human Cognitive Modeling Language (HCM-L). It was developed to preserve the episodic memory of a person in the form of conceptual behavior models including relevant context. The work is part of the Human Behavior Monitoring and Support (HBMS) project, a research project in the field of Ambient Assisted Living funded by the Klaus Tschira Stiftung gGmbH. HBMS aims at monitoring a person's behavior using activity recognition techniques, generating models from their output, and providing focused and timely support by the use of intelligent reasoning mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a type of anxiety disorder which impacts every day functioning, particularly in terms of interpersonal relationships. The cognitive-behavioral model is regarded as one of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Though this model has long informed clinical practice, it has been criticized for its overreliance on cognitive processes and rational thinking, disregarding the role of emotions as well as other biological and social factors. This limitation is especially evident in the treatment of SAD, where cognitivebehavioral approaches often fail to produce long-term results. In this study, we will argue in favor of a new approach as a unifying theory of anxiety formation, emerging in the last decade from the field of computational psychiatry, focusing on the brain’s predictive mechanisms. We will show how SAD can arise from erroneous interoceptive inferences—incorrect predictions about internal bodily states— which lead to unreliable predictions about the social environment. These erroneous inferences reinforce the individual's perception that the social world is unpredictable and that their actions are insufficient to reduce this uncertainty, creating a state of learned uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "This paper extends three decades of work arguing that researchers who discuss consciousness should not restrict themselves only to (adult) human minds, but should study (and attempt to model) many kinds of minds, natural and artificial, thereby contributing to our understanding of the space containing all of them. We need to study what they do or can do, how they can do it, and how the natural ones can be emulated in synthetic minds. That requires: (a) understanding sets of requirements that are met by different sorts of minds, i.e. the niches that they occupy, (b) understanding the space of possible designs, and (c) understanding complex and varied relationships between requirements and designs. Attempts to model or explain any particular phenomenon, such as vision, emotion, learning, language use, or consciousness lead to muddle and confusion unless they are placed in that broader context. A methodology for making progress is summarised and a novel requirement proposed for a theory of how human minds work: the theory should support a single generic design for a learning, developing system that, in addition to meeting familiar requirements, should be capable of developing different and opposed philosophical viewpoints about consciousness, and the so-called hard problem. In other words, we need a common explanation for the mental machinations of mysterians, materialists, functionalists, identity theorists, and those who regard all such theories as attempting to answer incoherent questions. No designs proposed so far come close.",

Relating the process of aging to biological and functional decay does not do justice to the accumulation of knowledge and abilities over the active lifespan. Human development is a continuous process of growth and decline. It accounts for both gain and loss of cognitive abilities. From this perspective human capacities are not static but composed of a changing set of abilities which grow and decline over the life span. Despite decreasing capacity with age, reserve capacity may be sufficient to cope with normal task demands. Finally, it is illustrated how experience of older workers may contribute to the design of training programs.",

Research on procrastination and its relation with various psychological factors has identified that procrastination is not laziness or a lack of time management skill but rather than a complex property with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional variables. In addition, as studies have found that procrastination has different characteristics in the cognitive, motivational, emotional process, attempts have been made to classify subtypes of procrastination. The investigation of typological characteristics will help us offer sophisticated and effective therapeutic interventions.

      "abstract": "Aberrant behaviour, defined as activities that deviate from societal or psychological norms, is impacted by a complex interaction of biological, environmental, psychological, and sociocultural influences rather than just being a reflection of moral failing or intentional deviance. According to neurobiological research, impulsive and violent behavior can be significantly attributed to structural abnormalities in the brain, such as those in the prefrontal cortex. These behaviors are further shaped by sociocultural pressures including poverty and violence, as well as environmental factors such as adverse childhood experiences. Psychological theories that explain how these behaviors arise and endure include Freud's psychoanalytic model and Bandura's Social Learning Theory. Abnormal conduct can take many different forms, among which are aggressiveness, substance misuse, and risk-taking. Mental health problems and social isolation are frequent psychological effects of this kind of conduct. To lessen the effects on people and society, effective interventions consisting of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatments must be proposed. These interventions have to consider into account the causes and manifestations of aberrant behavior and offer more useful remedies to individuals who are impacted by it by looking at it through a variety of perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Little by little the concern to ensure no only cognitive development of the child, but emotional one as well, is becoming more common for the education system practices. The concept of emotional intelligence encourages the resort to traditional educational model (‘knowledge model’) of teaching students. That model invites students to be aware of their own emotions, and to differentiate the emotions of the others. Besides, it is complemented by the task to master one’s emotional self-regulation. The idea of building education on an actor-activity basis, accompanied by an understanding of the importance of the integral personality development (including the emotion component), implies involving students in productive activities with the aim of developing their ability in self-regulation. Self-regulation of learning process calls for the reflective mastering of one’s motivational-emotional sphere. There is a natural connection between the development of intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, emotional involvement and insistence in achieving training target. The development of different sides of personality by separate courses will lead nowhere. It’s necessary not to introduce some additional courses for the development of emotional intelligence, but instead to restructure the educational system on an activity basis and to change teachers’ training. That will require the development of the teacher’s own emotional intelligence, his/her understanding of the logic of the emotional and social aspects of the child’s holistic development in ontogenesis; the mastering by the teacher the methods of organizing educational practice with the view of the integral development of the student’s personality. Such teacher training will allow to solve the tasks of social and emotional development of students not within the framework of autonomous training courses that increase the student’s workload, but during the implementation of basic training courses, the emotional and motivational involvement of students in which is important both for learning success and for their personal development.",

The purpose of this paper is to dissect the task, consider the component parts, clarify those aspects that can be problematic and highlight those that remain so. Method: The paper reviews the concepts, terminologies and dilemmas around alcoholism, insight, lack of insight, denial, judgement, will, decisional capacity and competence. Conclusion: Assessments of patients suffering from alcoholism (or any other dyscontrol problem such as deliberate self-harm, problem gambling or eating disorders) are likely to evoke unease because of the interweaving of potentially disputable phenomenological, clinical, ethical, semantic and legal aspects. Familiarity with the concepts and terms around decisional capacity helps to orientate clinicians in their work. There remain some particular conceptual issues that are in need of further scholarly attention.",

The dimensions of evaluation of the previous action (supportive, critical, unresponsive), knowledge content (contribution, repetition, null), and invitational form (command, question, statement) organize twenty‐seven individual actions, each with specific functions and conditions of use. Evaluations, repetitions and invitational forms link actions together to create coherent social interactions, and thereby serve as possible quantitative measures of collaboration quality. Specific individual action also helps constitute specific social interactions. Six types of social interactions that occur during group problem‐solving are organized by problem knowledge distribution (no one knows a problem approach, some know, or everyone knows) and degree of cooperation (independent or cooperative). This framework's mutually exclusive categories and multi‐function individual actions allow statistical analyses of many group interactions both in their entirety and infine detail.",

Cognitive stimulation, consisting of nonspecific cognition-enhancing activities often in group format, produces small improvements on some aspects of cognitive ability which can be accompanied by gains in quality of life, everyday functioning, and social interaction. Cognitive training which involves repeated practice of tasks that target specific cognitive functions, often using computers, provides improvements on trained tasks that usually do not translate to nontrained tasks and have little impact on real life. Cognitive rehabilitation represents an individual approach that focuses on disability rather than cognition per se and is helpful in terms of reaching personally relevant goals and improving day-to-day performance. Data are largely lacking to support commercial claims regarding the efficacy of video games or virtual reality and augmented reality devices. There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials whether cognition-focused interventions can delay or prevent cognitive decline. However, data from prospective cohort studies strongly suggest that late-life cognitive activity is associated with a reduced risk of dementia.",

      "title": "Capacity, attributability, and responsibility in mental disorder",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn this commentary on Anneli Jefferson's Are Mental Disorders Brain Disorders? I endorse her capacitarian approach to responsibility but suggest that the effects of at least some mental/brain disorders on the agent's psychology show that we cannot neatly separate the epistemic condition from the control condition when assessing agential capacity. I then discuss the labeling issue in the context of rival attributionist accounts of responsibility which hold that agents are responsible if their actions are attributable to them. The incorporation of mental disorders into identity through social processes may open agents with mental or brain disorders open to unfair blame. However, we cannot fully understand the effects of the disorders on agential capacity without closely attending to the social environment that shapes the way the disorder is conceived, enacted, perceived, and responded to over time.KEYWORDS: responsibilitymental disordercapacityattributabilityidentity Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1. Not wholly, of course. Labelling can affect what the agent can do via external means. It may mean that the agent is not granted ordinary epistemic authority and so their attempts to be understood and to act are frustrated. And this may be the case whether or not they have internalized the label. People labeled as addicts, for example, often have difficulty getting appropriate investigations and treatment in medical settings because it is assumed they are drug seeking. But typically the effects are thoroughly intertwined.2. Neo-Strawsonian accounts of responsibility, which highlight attributability, dominate current literature on responsibility, so it is somewhat surprising that Jefferson does not consider them.3. I question the claim that attributability is a face of responsibility (See Kennett, Citation2019). A person may be fully responsible for an act that was, as we say, out of character. Conversely, we may negatively evaluate a character/personality trait without holding the person morally responsible for it or for the actions that proceed from it. We may for example exclude a person and practice social distancing if we think they are too difficult or dangerous, whether or not we think they are responsible for their behavior. Not all forms of moral evaluation are evaluations of moral responsibility.4. Adopting or embracing mad identity does require a level of insight and acceptance that is often not present in psychotic illness.5. I do not intend to suggest that obligations to adapt are all on the side of the person with the disorder. This may be particularly the case for conditions that fall under the umbrella of neurodivergence. Countering negative labeling effects requires developing an awareness in neurotypicals of where our reasons-responsiveness might be deficient and of our obligations to meet others halfway.",

The materials of the study of concepts, problems, and research of soft skills in a professional environment are presented. The topic of soft skills is extremely relevant, both Russian and foreign students do not exactly understand what soft skills are, which may be explained by the fact that there is currently no single approach to understanding them. The purpose of studying this problem is to review concepts, problems and research on the topic of soft skills in foreign and national scientific literature. The results obtained make it possible to say that soft skills is a broad concept, and does not include a strictly defined list of qualities or abilities. There is evidence that researchers attribute a different set of abilities to soft skills, while different abilities will be most significant for different professional fields. Separately, such abilities can be distinguished as: communication skills, leadership position, decision-making skills, responsibility, empathy, self-esteem, critical thinking, analytical thinking, emotional intelligence (often assessed as part of soft skills in foreign studies). The most effective methods for developing soft skills include: methods for early development, educational tasks related to information search and analysis, critical thinking development, self-management (including the formulation of action plans), teamwork skills, and the presence of social and humanitarian disciplines (&amp;ldquo;Philosophy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sociology&amp;rdquo;), as well as specialized courses such as &amp;ldquo;Team Building&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Time Management&amp;rdquo;.

      "abstract": "There has always been a tendency in making a direct correlation between a students’s academic achievement and intelligence level. Whilst this may be true, but such assumption could be plainly too simplistic as there are other contributing factors which could significantly influence a students’s academic performance. Various surrounding varibles need to be carefully analyzed. The learning culture and pattern adopted by a student is cultivated through various varibles and underlying factors. Literature has suggested three broad dimensions for analysis which are personality, sociological and psychological factors. This paper will discuss the conceptial framework developed to examine the contributing factors to low academic achievement within four main domains: self-efficacy, cognitive ability, support system, and socio-economic. Self-efficacy can have an impact on psychological states to behaviour and to motivation. It would eventually affect how a person perceives learning and their cognitive ability. Efforts and mechanisms by the school in monitoring and supervising low achievers, and the teachers’ sense of responsibility toward the students will also be part of the consideration in framing the conceptual discussion. It is also necessary to examine the parents’ perceptions towards the importance of their chilren’s education and the extent of their involvement in their children’s education process as home environemnt marks the beginning of learning experience that shapes their attitudes towards learning. The conceptual framework will be used for an exploratory study in Perak state to analyze the contributing factors to low academic achievement amongst the secondary school students. The 2010 Penilaian Menengah Rendah (PMR) results announcement had raised a concern as the state of Perak stands amongst the last in the list in terms of achievement. The conceptual framework provides the foundation to thoroughly analyze the reasons why Perak has almost consistently, for the past years, been amongst the bottom in the list of nation-wide standard examinations performance like PMR. An empirical research will be conducted based on the conceptual framework discussed in this paper to examine the contributing factors to low academic performance in Perak which the findings could provide an insight to design an effective and impactful short-term and long-term intervention programs and initiatives for significant academic improvements in the long run.",

When\nthe social desirability bias is a concern (e.g., when asking\nsocially sensitive, embarrassing, or private questions),\nresearchers commonly use techniques such as indirect questioning to\navoid this bias. By asking respondents how most or the typical\nperson would respond (i.e, referring to a third party target) the\nrespondent transcends from an egocentric focus on his or her own\nunflattering attitudes or behavior onto that of an ambiguous\ntarget. Given the target’s indistinctness respondents project their\nown feelings, attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs when responding\nwhile remaining psychologically distanced from the true, yet\nsocially undesirable response. According to construal level theory\nthis process of “transcendence” is possible because individuals are\nable to form abstract mental construals (Trope and Liberman 2010).\nThis mental construal process is essential to recalling the past,\nempathizing with others, and visualizing future events. We propose\nthat when presented with an indirect question, respondents increase\ntheir mental construal to project a response onto the third party\ntarget. As mental construals increase, individuals refocus from\ndetailed, incidental features to central, fundamental\ncharacteristics (Trope and Liberman 2010). Consequently, we propose\nthat indirect questioning prompts respondents to deemphasize the\ncontextual demand to engage in impression management behavior by\nincreasing construal levels. This research serves three primary\npurposes. First, we propose construal level theory as a theoretical\nexplanation for indirection questioning. Second, we explore how\npsychological distances and construal level effectively reduce\nsocial desirability bias. Lastly, we test our theoretical model\nwithin a consumer choice context including sustainable products. We\nintegrate construal level theory with projective measurement\ntheory, thus extending knowledge in both domains. In Study 1, we\ninvestigate the association of seven commonly used marketing scales\nwith measures of socially desirable responding. As a preliminary\ndemonstration that increasing construal levels decreases the social\ndesirability bias, we manipulate the psychological distance of\nthese scales to reduce their association with socially desirable\nresponding measures. Results indicate that whereas indirect\nquestioning increasing social or spatial distance reduces the\nassociation with desirable responding measures, indirect\nquestioning increasing temporal distance magnifies this\nassociation. Study 2 further investigates the relationship between\nconstrual level and the social desirability bias through a product…",

The more powerfully an individual is motivated, the more likely they are to actually participate in an activity, and affective disorders can have a profound impact on an individual's motivation towards engagement in activity. In addition to the impact of affective disorders on an individual's ability to engage in their role-set, it is important to acknowledge the profound effect of role loss on mental health. Ageing can sometimes represent a contraction of our overall role-set. A note of caution must be sounded: occupational function is not just about being able to cope independently with activities of daily living, nor is it about having a routine crammed with activity.

Impairments of social cognition influence psychosocial functioning in the key domains of social performance, emotional/empathic performance, general cognitive functioning, and quality of life. Multiple treatment modalities have been used to target these difficulties, including antidepressant medication, psychotherapeutic approaches, and procedural interventions. Studies assess treatment efficacy based on the impact on facial affect recognition, interpretation of affective pictures, theory of mind performance, and prosody. Many current therapies are shown to have a normalizing effect for accuracy of interpretation and reduction in underlying negative interpretative bias. In particular, certain antidepressants seem to correct facial affect recognition deficits, while several psychotherapeutic approaches appear well suited for addressing impaired theory of mind or mood-congruent interpretative biases.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important roles of emotions is in communication or motivation, but they also affect the level of engagement. Design education assignments often require students to display exceptional creativity and problem-solving skills and also to mull over many questions. Negative moods like frustration, boredom, restlessness and sluggishness will not only affect people's learning ability but could also reduce productivity. With an educational emphasis on academic instruction, students are much less motivated to learn and make more frequent errors. Creating design that evoke emotions is a framework that addresses these needs through products or services that improve emotional experiences, increasing involvement. This research will use an action research approach, focusing on qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis technologies, to examine the impact of emotional concerns on communication design. The results can provide guidance for educators, designers, and researchers in developing innovative educational strategies that are responsive to emotional needs. Emotions are an indispensable part of the development of pedagogical ideas.",

These circumstances create the conditions for burnout, disengagement, and imperiled patient care.

The cumulative dynamic of moral distress results in myriad detrimental consequences affecting the bodies, emotions, minds, and souls of clinicians.

Psychology offers no exact and clearly definable concepts, therefore mathematics are principally out of the play—or at least much reduced in their possibilities.2. A test-result is supposedly built on a previous test-validation against a convincing and exact criterion. No such criteria are to be found in the psychological field.3. The interpreting and commentating psychologist is the central event. Therefore the education and training of psychologists necessarily has to stress courses in personal contact, interview and characterology.4. The problem is accentuated when the psychologists today are confronted with the task of giving an advice in connection with the admission of students to the teachers colleges and to similar branches of academical training.

This paper yields various mechanisms related to memory performance in spaced learning: delayed JOLs, JOL reactivity, overt retrieval, inhibition control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. All of these factors associate with the theory of mind, an important yet understudied social-cognitive skill in spaced learning which could shift our ways of thinking about spacing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Resilience is an interactive concept that refers to a relative resistance to environmental risk experiences, or the overcoming of stress or adversity. As such, it differs from both social competence positive mental health. Resilience differs from traditional concepts of risk and protection in its focus on individual variations in response to comparable experiences. Accordingly, the research focus needs to be on those individual differences and the causal processes that they reflect, rather than on resilience as a general quality. Because resilience in relation to childhood adversities may stem from positive adult experiences, a life‐span trajectory approach is needed. Also, because of the crucial importance of gene–environment interactions in relation to resilience, a wide range of research strategies spanning psychosocial and biological methods is needed. Five main implications stem from the research to date: (1) resistance to hazards may derive from controlled exposure to risk (rather than its avoidance); (2) resistance may derive from traits or circumstances that are without major effects in the absence of the relevant environmental hazards; (3) resistance may derive from physiological or psychological coping processes rather than external risk or protective factors; (4) delayed recovery may derive from “turning point” experiences in adult life; and (5) resilience may be constrained by biological programming or damaging effects of stress/adversity on neural structures.",

Empirical evidence from across diverse versions of life skills programmes (e.g., sport, physical activity, school physical education, and education contexts) is used to support the conceptual model and to critically evaluate how psychological constructs, such as self-determination theory (SDT) and PWB, can advance theory and practice in the sport-based life skills interventions literature.",

      "title": "Mind, meaning, and personhood in dementia: the effects of positioning",
      "abstract": "Abstract The effects of dementia derive from a great deal more than the documented neuropathological changes in the brain of the person thus diagnosed and can be exacerbated or ameliorated to some degree by the way the person is positioned by others in the everyday social world. By analysing the nature of their social interactions with others we can readily come to appreciate that the ways in which the person with dementia is treated by others can have a profoundly positive or profoundly negative effect on (1) the subjective experience of the person with dementia; (2) the degree to which the person can display remaining intact cognitive abilities; (3) the ability of the person to meet the demands of everyday life; and (4) the quality of the person's social life and the meaning found in each day.Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu in Zulu conveys the idea that, ‘a person is a person through others’. When we begin to think about the practical meaning of this Zulu idea as it applies to people with dementia, we are confronted with what might appear to be a disjunction in the way in which persons and their attributes are viewed socially and the way in which a person's attributes are understood in terms of biomedical approaches to disease. Likewise, we are also sensitized more deeply regarding the nature of the social interactions that occur between a person with dementia and healthcare professionals. In the biological model, the tendency is to attempt to understand the nature of a disease and its signs and symptoms by viewing the diagnosed person in isolation. Social interactions are limited to those with the examining clinicians. The effects of the disease are solely understood in terms of the physical and mental changes that have occurred in the person as a result of, in the case of dementia, neuropathology. Thus, by comparing the ways in which the person comported themselves in previous years to their present comportment, we note losses. Such losses are attributed to the neuropathology of the disease and these, taken together with the person's subjective complaints, are referred to as the signs and symptoms of the illness. Our biomedical conceptualization is further informed by the person's performance on neuropsychological tests and how that performance compares to that of age-matched, otherwise healthy, people. The ways in which family informants report the person's actions and discourse as being less coherent or efficient than previously are interpreted as being ‘effects’ caused by the illness alone. Thus, relatively little weight is given to the possibility that there might be psychosocial influences that also affect the person's actions. However, the medical literature has not always been antithetical to a broader approach.It was Lipowski who noted that a disease is not to be understood as being separate from the afflicted person and that a person encompasses not only a biological organism but also the world of…feeling and symbolic activities in thought and language. Furthermore, he is a member of a social group with which he interacts. A concept of disease is incomplete unless it takes cognizance of these facts. How a person experiences the pathological process, what it means to him, and how this meaning influences his behaviour and interaction with others are all integral components of disease as viewed as a total human response. (Lipowski 1969, p. 1198)Taking this line of thinking further, Lipowski states rather pointedly,The response of the family caregiver and other meaningful people to the patient's illness or disability, to his communications of distress, and to his inability to perform the usual social roles may spell the difference between optimal recovery or psychological invalidism. (Lipowski 1969, p. 1200)Exactly what sorts of responses to the person with the diagnosis have the potential to promote recovery or ‘psychological invalidism’? Before attempting to answer this question, it is important to recognize that in almost all types of dementia complete or near complete recovery is not currently possible. Still, even if we put aside the possibility of full recovery, optimal functioning, if attainable and sustainable for even a short time, could have profoundly positive effects not only on the person with dementia but also on their family and carers. That is to say, if it were possible to provide some interventions that might facilitate the ability of the person with dementia to communicate as effectively as possible, to interact with others as coherently as possible, and to sustain their sense of self-worth in the face of the effects of brain injury, it would be tremendously advantageous psychologically as well as financially to all concerned.One purpose of the present chapter is to explore possible psychosocial interventions aimed at avoiding psychological invalidism. First, however, it is important to explore some subtle ways in which attitudes and actions of those deemed healthy may have untoward effects on the person with dementia.",

      "abstract": "People can be highly responsive to the so-called “personality frame” through which to learn. Such framing may be achieved through a live human actor, a tutor agent, a non-playable character in a game, a representation of a professional, a digital avatar in a virtual world, an artificial intelligence (AI) robot, or some other representation of an individual being. Various types of characters—real or imaginary, dynamic (animated) or static, humanoid or animal or other—may appear in online teaching and learning. Various dimensions of a character's appearance, sound, communications, behaviors, actions, and other dimensions may communicate something of their designed (scripted) personality and motivations, resulting in learner engagement, learner interactions with the learning. This chapter explores visual-based character origination, design, development, and evolution for learning.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive behavior in interpersonal relations is always connected with time characteristics such as sequence, rhythm, and succession of actions. In our research we attempted to determine the role of time parameters in the development of the following social communications: (a) interpersonal relations, (b) communicative acts, and (c) the process of structuring social behavior. We intended to show the role of time in acquiring and mastering social contacts. In our research we outlined a number of methods for developing time competence and various conscious and unconscious ways to organize time and to create an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, and trust in interpersonal nonverbal communication. The time characteristics of social behavior and its nonverbal manifestation can exert a positive influence on communicative activity and can determine time competence in communication. Ignoring time parameters in the self-realization and self-actualization of personality introduces a certain destructive element into the process of interpersonal relations; hence the necessity of teaching competence in communication arises. Teaching is carried out in the process of training and includes several stages: the introductory stage and the stages of intensification, integration, avoidance, and others. Thus, time management and the process of teaching time management allow one to discover time resources for the self-organization of one’s personality over a lifetime.",

      "abstract": ": Individuals with health issues and disabilities tend to encounter difficulties in the workplace, including decreased productivity and lower job performance compared to those without such problems. Nevertheless, creating a workplace environment that accommodates individuals with disabilities can help them overcome workplace obstacles and fulfil their job duties at the same level as disability-free individuals. Providing reasonable accommodation is one practical step in establishing an inclusive environment for those with vision impairments, leading to career development and psychological well-being. This paper focuses on workplace-related autoethnographic stories to explore the fundamental aspects of reasonable accommodation, career development, and psychological well-being for individuals with vision impairments. This study employed the method of autoethnography in qualitative research. Autoethnographic data was collected through personal reflection and the collection of relevant artefacts. Thematic analysis was used for the data analysis procedure. Therefore, having a disability does not necessarily mean an individual cannot do their job to the necessary standard. Visually impaired individuals can excel in their careers and attain psychological well-being when they are part of a workplace environment that is accommodating to their needs. To enhance job performance, career goals, and psychological well-being among employed disabled individuals, it is necessary to define \"reasonable accommodation\" in the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, based on the UN Convention.",

Emotions consist of multiple components that may include intentions, action tendencies, appraisals, other cognitions, central and peripheral changes in physiology, and subjective feelings. Emotions are not directly observable, but are inferred from expressive behavior, self-report, physiological indicators, and context. I focus on expressive behavior because of its coherence with other indicators and the depth of research on the facial expression of emotion in behavioral and computer science. In this paper, among the topics I include are approaches to measurement, timing or dynamics, individual differences, dyadic interaction, and inference. I propose that design and implementation of perceptual user interfaces may be better informed by considering the complexity of emotion, its various indicators, measurement, individual differences, dyadic interaction, and problems of inference.",

      "title": "Transforming Leader Development through Lifelong Learning",
      "abstract": "THE ARMY IS in the process of transforming itself. Through the Army Training and Leader Development Panel (ATLDP) assessment process, it is exploring the use of three meta-competencies: self-awareness, adaptability, and lifelong learning.1 A meta-competency is defined as competency that is so powerful that it affects the person's ability to acquire other competencies.2 The three metacompetencies are symbiotic and create a developmental condition that propels the learner at a faster and more complex rate than do traditional pedagogical instruction or experiential learning. Learning is the critical activity leading to progress or growth. The challenge for organizations is to instill in individuals a desire to make learning a lifelong pursuit. Lifelong learning is defined as an individual's choice to pursue knowledge to progress beyond a known state of development or competence. Lifelong learning is a matter of psychological conditioning, not mechanical function. Without an individual's commitment to grow intellectually, the organization will fall short of its potential. Missing from previous methods to encourage lifelong learning is the systematic use of feedback, the single most important element in the learning process. Feedback increases self-awareness and allows for dysfunctional behaviors to become unfrozen so that new, functional ones can be developed. Feedback is the basis for increasing self-awareness and empowering the individual with choice. Without feedback, learning is limited. The human condition is such that people are blind to their own behaviors and nonverbal communication. Feedback from others in the organization provides awareness of how a person is perceived by others. The Army has always had soldiers who were motivated to learn and excel at their specialty or profession. The 1987 Sullivan study incorporated the value of this self-developmental approach.3 It broadened the application of self-development to the Army at large by incorporating self-development as one of the three pillars of development. In the previous leader development model, the three-pillar format was referred to as the Parthenon because its appearance suggested a Greek temple. The prevailing efforts in the Army today are to link lifelong learning by employing the mechanics of data transference. Army Transformation and perceived future requirements have demonstrated a need to develop in leaders a personal responsibility for learning. Indeed, the ATLDP series of studies found lifelong learning a critical requirement for future development. Tempo-Centric Linkage and Human Development The Army's leader development process is sequential and progressive. The key assumption is that learning is the result of experiences that build on one another. Learning or comprehending increasingly complex information depends on a sequence of prerequisite learning events. This suggests a learning environment that moves from the known to the more known with the passage of time as leaders experience duties, schooling, and self-education.4 Certainty, however, decreases with education. The more a person learns, the more he or she realizes they do not know, and the more he or she seeks to learn. This developmental process is counter-intuitive to the operational and fixed resource models the Army uses to develop doctrine and force structure. The Army traditionally tries to anticipate requirements derived from an anticipated operational situation. The Army builds a force structure or resources that allow it to accomplish its anticipated mission. This is achieved by determining a reasonable estimate of time required to gather mission resources and to meet situational requirements. All too often, this process includes predicting a predetermined set of leadership skills, competencies, and characteristics of a future leader for a future force. This is a futile exercise for two reasons. It is impossible to predict the future. …",

Clearly, an important aspect of social cognition is thinking about and planning for other agents’ actions. But what processes are involved in thinking about others’ actions, as opposed to one’s own actions? This chapter introduces some broad ideas about the possible sensorimotor foundations of action representation in both self and other, drawing on recent findings from the fields of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The chapter is organized around three themes: (1) how action experience shapes the representation of others’ actions; (2) action affordances and the representation of space in relation to self and other; and (3) distinguishing self and other.",

However there are different types of intelligence, such as creativity, logic, lateral thinking, memory and personality (EQ/Emotional Intelligence) that are equally or more important than IQ.Test and Assess Your Brain Quotient helps you to assess these different types of intelligence. It consists of numerous tests and assessments which examine your agility of mind, powers of logical analysis, numerical, verbal and spatial aptitudes, memory and personality. The results of the tests are then collated into a final section, providing an overall rating or Brain Quotient (BQ). The brain quotient reveals your strengths, such as connecting with people emotionally and your weaknesses, such as a poor memory, helping you to identify your true potential for achievement. It will help you to build and capitalise on these strengths while improving your performance in areas of weakness.Test and Assess Your Brain Quotient will help you to exploit your enormous brain potential, increase its performance and enhance quickness of thought.

      "title": "Decision in the pedagogical professional practice and the abduction’s function",
      "abstract": "The aim of this short contribution is to present a summary of the decision problem within the profession of the pedagogist, and the fundamental role of the abduction  (’απαγωγή, retroduction) process in its proper context, in professional practice of the pedagogist, as in all professional practice involving the social and professional pedagogy. Pedagogy is a field for reflection, application and commitment or engagement to education. Moreover, pedagogy is establishing itself as a profession, the profession of the pedagogist (not of the educator, who is a different figure), in the socio-health, intellectual, cultural and aid profession field, even in spite of heavy delays and failures of the Italian laws and the resistance of professional groups related but already recognized both by law and by society. The so-called “ pedagogical interlocution ” is a paradigmatic form of the professional pedagogical practice. Decision in professional pedagogy, properly speaking, must be reached by the interlocutor(s), who must debate and develop it, with the aid of the professional pedagogist. Abduction is not a valid syllogism: it concerns a possible example of a general case or of a rule, whose the actual pertinence to this general case or this rule is mediated by the professional or expert assumptions. The professional approach of the pedagogist, from methodological point of view, is casuistic (case based) and situational as a form of aid given to the person, alternative and other than to the statistical-operational methodology that addresses rather to populations composed of individuals. Cases of general interest in professional pedagogy can be labeled as “casuistries” or “case study” categories. A good collection of casuistries - case study categories is provided by Erich Fromm, concerning the problems of family education; and by Viktor E. Frankl in his search for sense, Lebenssinn or λόγος . A further range of examples of categories based on case studies which can be dealt with a pedagogical professional methodology are the life and studies orientation problems. A fourth class of examples, applicable differently but methodologically similar, offers to us the autogenic training, particularly the choice of the propositional formula, called and eventually repeated both in the opening and in the closure, which must be adapted to the particular case of each single person; and this can be considered a specific pedagogical competence as the gradual training to the technique proposed by Johannes Heinrich Schultz reveals to be. Professional pedagogy, by this way, can make an important and an authentic and specific contribution to general discussion about decision in the social, human and cultural sciences (or human- sozial- geistes- Wissenschaften ).",

We further contend that certain learner types – Experiencers, Contemplators, Thinkers and Doers – should act as DAs pointing out faulty perceptions, reflections, conceptions and/or actions. Meanwhile, the rest of the team should act as DIs, both critiquing DAs and collaborating with them, to synergize advanced perceptions, reflections, conceptions or actions.

      "abstract": "In the last ten years there has been increasing concern about the well known old practice of victimization at work, which in recent years has emerged with new characteristics, aims and consequences and is now generally referred to as mobbing behavior. This increased attention seems to be due to increased awareness of individual rights and respect for the dignity of self and others, and to the new economy emphasis on flexibility and reorganizational needs. Moral violence should not be confused with the normal competition and conflicts encountered in work place. Mobbing can be originated by traditional causes such as eliminating an undesired individual or by a precise corporate strategy aimed at reducing the workforce organizations. Mobbing has been recognized as a significant source of individual discomfort and subsequently illness. Lacking specific diagnostic criteria, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Adjustment Disorder have been adopted from the international classification of mental diseases (DSM). However, interviews and personality screening highlight specific differences compared with other psychic disorders, not in symptom severity but in the induced loss of parameters which guarantee individual consistency in life, namely self-esteem, event intelligibility, cause-effect relationship, confidence in others, which lead to role and status depletion and eventually acquisition of an invalid personality. The human and economic cost of antisocial behavior at work, with illness, absenteeism and finally unemployment is extremely high for the victims and their families, employers and society. Mobbing control is not only a prevention target but a moral obligation. It should be recognized that interpersonal correctness, respect of individual skills and dignity do not interfere with group efficiency, reorganization, staff reduction and relocation and that these aims can be reached without destroying an individual.",

Theoretical perspectives underpinning the development of a framework for understanding optimal cognitive development are described, including differential development, intra-individual dynamics, cascades, biological mechanisms, reserve capacity, and plasticity. The Cognitive Health and Environment Life Course Model (CHELM) is proposed as a means to provide a framework for understanding the socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health factors influencing cognitive development and decline. The CHELM may guide framing of policy and interventions to optimize cognitive development and minimize cognitive decline in late-life.",

      "abstract": "There is no accepted definition and no adequate measure for the concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI). Some of the myriad issues surrounding EI are discussed here. One problem in the consideration of EI is the confusion between the terms and Differences between the two are examined and a working definition of feelings is offered. To further refine the concept of EI, the Style in the Perception of Affect Scale was developed to measure skills in the integrated, rapid, and effortless awareness of changes in body feelings that constitute the prompts for emotions. Accurate and rapid awareness of the feelings, it is suggested, allows for accurate and rapid emotional and behavioral responses. Without this skill, responses tend to be delayed and inappropriate. Analysis shows that this style of perceiving feelings correlates highly with mental health, contentment, creativity, and personal warmth. It is theorized that this style, by utilizing the subject's feeling awareness of the subtleties in the communications and responses of other persons, is the foundation also for empathy and social intelligence, which are qualities often grouped with EI. It is further suggested that this skill in rapid attention to changing bodily feelings may promote self-healing.

      "abstract": "The title of this chapter sets out a topic (the socialization of cognition) and asks a question (what is involved?). To introduce my answer, and to explain what I mean by the socialization of cognition, I start by differentiating between psychologists' approaches to the study of social development and to the study of cognitive development. From the beginning the study of social development reflected a strong interest in the acquisition of values or value-laden qualities: honesty, reponsibility, empathy, friendliness, healthy adjustment, prosocial behavior. It also pointed to the social environment as the main factor in the acquisition of these qualities. What came later was an interest in skills and strategies – the skills needed, for instance, to enter a social group, make friends, ask for help, or refuse a request without disastrous consequences. Often as an accompaniment to the interest in skills and strategies (although not dictated by it), there appeared as well an interest in the effect of internal factors, with a particular emphasis on the unfolding of cognitive capacity – the capacity, for instance, to take the perspective of another, to judge interactions, or to estimate the consequences of an action.",

      "abstract": "Rejection is a generally disliked experience. A large body of literature almost solely focuses on social rejection; however, rejection can also be the result of a work-related factor (e.g., manuscript, promotion, product idea). The overarching goals of this paper are to propose a construct, workplace rejection (WPR), and provide a theoretical model to illustrate how it relates to workplace outcomes, namely job performance and job satisfaction. By synthesizing previous theories and reviewing the literature, we provide 15 compelling propositions and help spur the maturation of this concept. The propositions explain noteworthy context (i.e., level of personal investment, availability of other opportunities, presence of a support system), delivery (i.e., clarifying reason behind rejection, providing feedback), individual differences (i.e., neuroticism, hardiness, rejection sensitivity, identity, goal orientation, attribution, locus of control), and interventions (i.e., exposure therapy, growth mindset training) can potentially amplify or mitigate the negative impact of workplace rejection. Our theoretical model approaches real-world problems from a novel angle, but only scratches the surface of a promising pipeline of research. The continued study of WPR can yield meaningful implications for both theory and practice.",

The chapter also presents a list of commonly used tests designed to assess neuropsychological processes and abilities for three- to five-year-old children. Visuospatial processing is a broad cognitive process comprising many components related to processing visual stimuli, including attending to visual input, planning motor movements, integrating motor movements and visual stimuli, and eye-tracking and scanning. Executive functioning describes the overarching skills necessary to regulate cognitive processes by focusing and shifting attention, processing sensory input, and performing intentional motor output. Sensorimotor functions are the building blocks for higher-order cognitive processing and influence the ability to acquire knowledge.",

      "title": "Dysleksi og selvoppfatning: En kvalitativ intervjuundersøkelse intervjuundersøkelse",
      "abstract": "I skolen skal man traede varsomt, thi der bliver mennesker til. (Grundtvig) Den foreliggende forskningsoppgaven handler om dysleksi. Et gjennomgaende tema i hele arbeidet har vaert hvordan erfaringer fra skoletiden kan pavirke menneskers grunnleggende tro pa muligheten for kontroll over egne livsbetingelser. Det teoretiske grunnlaget er knyttet til sosial interaksjon og hvordan mennesker pavirkes av signaler fra sine omgivelser. Herunder presenteres teorier om selvoppfatning og motivasjon for a belyse hvordan et grunnleggende behov for a tenke positivt om seg selv far konsekvenser for den enkeltes atferd i prestasjonssituasjoner. Motivasjonen for skolens laeringsaktiviteter pavirkes i takt med hvordan de oppfattes a kunne styrke eller svekke muligheten for tilfredsstillelse av dette behovet. Derfor vil mennesker vaere mest motivert for a gjore det de forventer a lykkes med, mens de forsoker a unnga aktiviteter som medforer risiko for nederlag. Motivasjonen for a opprettholde en positiv selvoppfatning er sterkere og mer grunnleggende behov enn for eksempel det a bli flink i lesing og skriving eller andre skolefag. Samtidig er skolen som organisasjon baerer av en kultur der den enkeltes prestasjoner vurderes og sammenlignes opp mot standardiserte aldersrelaterte forventninger. For personer med laerevansker eller funksjonshemninger medforer denne kulturen okt risiko for gjentatte nederlagsopplevelser, og okt behov for a beskytte selvoppfatningen. Menneskelig atferd handler om mangesidige og komplekse sammenhenger, og mestringsopplevelser kan bare forstas gjennom det som uttrykkes av de som eier opplevelsene. En vil aldri fullt ut kunne forsta og langt mindre gjengi andre menneskers erfaringer. Forskning pa dette feltet vil likevel matte framstilles ut fra en gitt forstaelsesramme. I lys av denne ma det legges stein pa stein for etter hvert a oppna innsikt i hva manglende mestringsopplevelser kan fore til. Dette sokes gjennom seks voksne personers erfaringer og opplevelser med dysleksi, med ulik alder og kjonn. Det empiriske materialet er knyttet til deres beskrivelse av erfaringer fra ulike faser og omrader i livet; skolegang, arbeid og privatliv. Datainnsamlingen har foregatt gjennom kvalitative intervju. Dataene framstilles forst som informantenes konkrete, retrospektive beskrivelse av erfaringer med fenomenet. Deretter blir kunnskapsgrunnlaget i hver enkelt beskrivelse analysert i lys av fellestrekk og likheter pa tvers av enkeltframstillingene. Beskrivelsene forstas og tolkes pa bakgrunn av teorier om dysleksi som fenomen og teorier om motivasjon og selvoppfatning. Dette settes inn en kontekstuell ramme av skolesystemets prestasjonskultur, arbeidslivets okende krav til skriftspraklige ferdigheter, og den enkeltes malorientering. Studiet soker a bidra til forstaelse og innsikt i fenomenet dysleksi og hvordan behovet for a tenke positivt om seg selv, kan fa konsekvenser for malorientering og laeringsatferd. Det peker ogsa pa hvorfor instrumentalistiske tilnaerminger alene ikke kan fore til onskede effekter av ulike spesialundervisningstiltak. En didaktisk konsekvens av en slik forstaelse innbaerer styrking av elevenes selvoppfatning og skolesystemets toleranse og aksept for forskjellighet",

      "abstract": "Cognitive effort is thought to be familiar in everyday life, ubiquitous across multiple variations of task and circumstance, and integral to cost/benefit computations that are themselves central to the proper functioning of cognitive control. In particular, cognitive effort is thought to be closely related to the assessment of cognitive control’s costs. I argue here that the construct of cognitive effort, as it is deployed in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, is problematically unclear. The result is that talk of cognitive effort may paper over significant disagreement regarding the nature of cognitive effort, and its key functions for cognitive control. I highlight key points of disagreement, and several open questions regarding what causes cognitive effort, what cognitive effort represents, cognitive effort’s relationship to action, and cognitive effort’s relationship to consciousness. I also suggest that pluralism about cognitive effort – that cognitive effort may manifest as a range of intentional or non-intentional actions the function of which is to promote greater success at paradigmatic cognitive control tasks – may be a fruitful and irenic way to conceive of cognitive effort. Finally, I suggest that recent trends in work on cognitive control suggests that we might fruitfully conceive of cognitive effort as one key node in a complex network of mental value, and that studying this complex network may illuminate the nature of cognitive control, and the role of consciousness in cognitive control’s proper functioning.",

      "abstract": "Learned helplessness is defined as the mental situation appearing after a person is not able to control the actions or chain of actions due to a negative event or many events. According to experimental findings, in an individual who experiences uncontrollable cases, a decreasing effect in the capacity of learning the behaviors to be produced in the controllable cases is observed. Ensuing helplessness arising from this occurring goes on affecting mentally. Learned helplessness is a phenomena happening after a person mentally interprets a situation and indicates this to the behavior. This affects the individuals’ success and failure. The discourses systematically analyzing the learning processes in different aspects, which is really fairly complicated, and trying to explain what learning is, what for it happens in a certain way, and how it happens can be generally observed in two category; behaviorist and cognitive. Behaviorists observe the learning as the relation between stimuli and reaction and generally explain it being learnt of observed behaviors (Ersanli, 2002). Cognitive development consists of thinking, memory, and changes in the language. Cognitive development, according to the schemes occurring in the mind, happens by realizing the new items according to this scheme and absorbing them to it, and adapting them (Kucukkaragoz, 2002). In this study, the effect of phenomena of learned helplessness to the individuals’ success has been worked in behaviorist and cognitive approach. In this study there is a relation between an individual’s success and learned helplessness. Moreover, it was observed that the sex and the economic situation also affected the success. it was understood that the rate of anxiety is higher among the individuals in the low and middle class. Girls were also seen having higher anxiety because of their emotional behaviors. But in the case there was no high emotion mode, their mark average was higher than the boys. It was seen that low anxiety mode affected the success positively.",

      "title": "Closing the Gap Between Cognitive Performance and Real-World Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia: The Importance of Metacognition",
      "abstract": "Functional outcome in schizophrenia has received increased attention in recent years, as the knowledge that cognitive functioning is a major determinant of outcome has become widely accepted. While impaired cognitive functioning is the most consistent predictor of functional deficits in schizophrenia, the overlap is far from complete and cognition accounts for at most 50% of the variance in functional outcome. In this paper, we review the research on factors other than cognition that relate to functional skills deficits in schizophrenia and focus on several potential moderators between cognition and functional outcome. These factors include various affective and societal variables, as well as metacognition. Metacognitive processes include the ability to appraise the accuracy of ones knowledge and competence and to use these appraisals to adjust real-world behaviors accordingly. Metacognition is related to, but separate from social cognition as well as from formal, base-level cognitive test performance. An example of metacognitive process is the ability to monitor the limits of personal knowledge base, and seek assistance in situations where requisite information or skills are lacking. Being able to perform these monitoring and control operations can allow for suitable functional performance despite cognitive limitations. Conversely, failing to perform these operations can account for poor functional outcome despite intact cognitive abilities. We argue that metacognition is an important moderator between cognition and real-world function and that this factor, in contrast to societal variables, may be modifiable in individual patients with schizophrenia.

This paper presents a formal model and a cognitive process for rigorously explaining human attentions. Cognitive foundations of attentions and their relationships with consciousness and other perception processes are explored. The closed loop of attentions is identified that encompasses event capture and behavior reaction. Events for attention are classified into the categories of external stimuli and internal motivations. Behaviors as corresponding responses of attentions encompass recurrent, temporary, and reflex actions. Mathematical models of attentions are created as a foundation for rigorously describing the cognitive process of attentions in denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of the unified attention model are identified in cognitive informatics, cognitive computing, and computational intelligence toward the mimic and simulation of human attention and perception in cognitive computers, cognitive robotics, and cognitive systems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article explores spirituality as a form of intelligence. The evidence for spirituality as a set of capacities and abilities that enable people to solve problems and attain goals in their everyday lives is evaluated. Five components of spiritual intelligence are identified: (a) the capacity for transcendence; (b) the ability to enter into heightened spiritual states of consciousness; (c) the ability to invest everyday activities, events, and relationships with a sense of the sacred; (d) the ability to utilize spiritual resources to solve problems in living; and (e) the capacity to engage in virtuous behavior (to show forgiveness, to express gratitude, to be humble, to display compassion). Evidence that spirituality meets the criteria for an intelligence is reviewed. Implications of studying spirituality within an intelligence framework are discussed.",

The history of measure development within school psychology is rich. Rating scales are continua on which entities are ordered based on some construct. A typical rating scale item might be a behavioral statement such as the following from the Preschool Behavior Screening System: Has temper tantrums. The initial phase of creating a measurement tool, regardless of type, is planning the development process, which necessarily includes envisioning the outcome of one's work. Kilgus et al. developed the Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavior Risk Screener to be a usable, contextually appropriate, psychometrically strong rating scale measure of risk for academic, social, and emotional behavioral difficulties. Once the process of developing and validating a measure has been planned, the next step is developing items.",

A number of different psychological approaches attempt to explain individual and situational differences in persistence and there is mounting evidence that interventions can be implemented to increase persistence. New technological capabilities offer the opportunity to seamlessly gather evidence about persistence from individuals' interactions in digital environments. Two examples of assessment of persistence in digital games are presented. Both demonstrate the ability to gather information without interruption of activity and the use of in-game actions as evidence. They also both require consideration of the student/player model, task model, and evidence models. A design pattern outlining each of these elements is presented for use by those considering assessment of persistence in digital environments.",

Life is well satisfied with all good and proper factors and condition which it needs. So, many factors can make life and keep it going safely, however some may be more effective than others and some may be more objective or subjective in their effects on life. According to some researches' findings, purposeful life conditions such as physical health, socioeconomic status, financial situation, physical environment, and social involvement cannot explain well-being of older people perfectly. Instead, personality characteristics and developmental influences have stronger impact [1].

The author postulates that different states of cognitivefunctioning exist and that individuals change to different states as they reach different points of cognitive power-measured in time horizons-rather than particular ages. Work is measured in terms of time spans for its completion, and from this the author develops a stratified hierarchy of organization. A \"quintave\" theory of cognitive development based on four cognitive states-shaping, reflective articulation, extrapolation, and transformation of systemsis presented, with the four states appearing repeatedly in increasingly complex settings in higher organizational strata. The author discusses the maturation of individuals' cognitive power, hypothesizing that everyone does not mature along the same track of cognitive development, with some maturing further along the track than others, and proposing instead a multiple track theory. The author concludes that cognitive development differs from intelligence quotient (IQ), and that it occurs regardless of social and economic opportunities for exercising cognitive power.",

      "abstract": "Este artigo tem como objetivo sintetizar teorias sobre o impacto do envelhecimento na cognição, em geral, e, especificamente, em funções executivas, sobretudo em processos relacionados ao raciocínio. A compreensão deste tema possibilita o delineamento de intervenções que possam melhorar a qualidade de vida da população idosa, tendo em vista as tendências mundiais de mudança na constituição da pirâmide etária. Durante o envelhecimento, ainda possua alto grau de escolarização, o ser humano passa por declínios cognitivos relacionados à idade (também chamado de envelhecimento cognitivo). Mesmo durante o envelhecimento típico (não patológico), há evidências de que o envelhecimento se relaciona ao declínio em diferentes graus em algumas habilidades cognitivas, como memória de trabalho, funções executivas, velocidade de processamento, memória episódica; ainda que haja um crescimento no vocabulário. Há também crescentes evidências de que os déficits relacionados à idade são moderados por outros fatores importantes, como metas, motivação e conhecimentos prévios. Como exemplos de intervenções, serão trazidos estudos sobre aperfeiçoamento da flexibilidade cognitiva através de operações focadas em treino de raciocínio e argumentação. Também serão relatados resultados de um estudo empírico realizado pelos autores com 15 idosos num programa de intervenção focado em argumentação adaptado para pessoas idosas, com duração de 10 semanas. Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que, quando comparado ao início da intervenção, houve maior densidade de flexibilização do raciocínio e menor densidade de polarização do raciocínio dos participantes ao final da intervenção. A escassez de estudos nesta área se constitui num campo promissor que abre uma importante agenda de pesquisa, especialmente num mundo no qual se observam mudanças na constituição da pirâmide etária.",

Peters' (1966, p. 25) classic characterization of the concept as the transmission of something worthwhile in a morally acceptable manner. And formal definitions such as this apart, it is clear that the practice of education unavoidably exhibits certain values. For example, the selection of curriculum content and teaching style, discipline regimes, the use of praise, the teacher's overt enthusiasms and ways of interacting with children, all do this. Yet notwithstanding this awareness of the ways in which values are embedded in education, there sometimes remains a tendency to see the development of children's thinking as a purely cognitive matter-a 'neutral' getting them to 'think better': more logically, rationally, critically, creatively, etc. This stance is reinforced to some extent by the influence of notions of children's thinking as passing through universal cognitive stages as for example argued by Piaget, or as being enhanced through the development of certain techniques or the acquisition of 'executive thinking skills' identified by metacognitive psychology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Crafting is the intentional and proactive behavioural or cognitive changes people make to satisfy their psychological needs. This can take place across life domains, including at work, at home, and in broader life goals, though little research exists comprehensively integrating the different crafting types. Psychological needs are one way that these various crafting types are related. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of the literature on crafting and the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning in life to better understand how these psychological needs relate to or impact the crafting process. We systematically searched four databases and found 134 papers that met the inclusion criteria. We found that autonomy and meaning in life were two psychological needs that were frequently related to the process of crafting and that competence and relatedness were important but less researched. The satisfaction of psychological needs were often an outcome of crafting, though only job crafting consistently measured psychological needs as the antecedent to crafting. We conclude with recommendations for future research and questions to be addressed. This review may be useful for future basic and applied crafting research by better understanding how specific psychological needs relate to the process of crafting and how individuals may proactively shape their needs.",

      "abstract": "Introducción Como consecuencia de la pandemia del Covid-19 se produjeron cambios en la sociedad, siendo la educación uno de los servicios que presentó modificaciones radicales en la metodología de enseñanza y aprendizaje. Los docentes no se encontraban cualificados para una transición de trabajo presencial a teletrabajo (1) y no sólo se vieron afectados por el cambio metodológico, sino también por sus dinámicas familiares, adaptación física del hogar, desencadenando así alteraciones de la salud mental tales como, ansiedad, sobrecarga de trabajo, desgaste profesional y estrés (2). Según algunos autores el estrés surge como resultado de una relación particular entre la persona y el entorno (3). Es así, como los docentes al hacer una evaluación cognitiva en que está inmerso, sumado al elemento emocional, despliega esfuerzos cognitivos y conductuales para manejar las demandas específicas externas y/o internas que son evaluadas como excedentes de los recursos del individuo, impidiendo la autorregulación de sus respuestas emocionales ante situaciones estresantes (4). La Organización Internacional del Trabajo, reconoce que el estrés se ha convertido en un riesgo ocupacional significativo de la docencia (4). Objetivos 1. Describir las características sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales de los docentes de Chillán y Laja,durante la pandemia. 2. Determinar el estrés percibido de los docentes de Chillán y Laja en la pandemia. 3. Determinar la relación entre estrés percibido con las características sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales de los docentes durante la pandemia. Método Diseño descriptivo correlacional, de corte transversal. La muestra fueron 92 docentes de las comunas de Laja y Chillán. Dentro de los criterios de inclusión se consideró a los docentes que realizaron actividades de educación presencial, híbrida o remota, se excluyeron los docentes que llevan menos de 30 días trabajando o estaban con licencia médica. Se aplico un cuestionario sociodemográfico y laboral, además de la Escala de Estrés Percibido que posee una estructura bidimensional, y cuenta con validación en Chile, con un Alfa de Cronbach de 0,79. Los datos fueron analizados con frecuencias relativas y absolutas para las variables cualitativas, y para las variables cuantitativas se usó medidas de resumen, las relaciones entre el estrés, las condiciones sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales se compararon las medidas de resumen del estrés por cada categoría de variables. El análisis estadístico fue con el programa SPSS versión 25.0. Se consideró la aplicación de consentimiento informado, autorización del director del establecimiento y la aprobación del Comité de Ética de la Universidad del Bío-Bío. Resultados principales La media de edad fue de 39 años, el 71,7% fueron mujeres, el 43,5% estaban solteros, el 64,1%, trabaja con contrato de planta, el 43,5% lleva ejerciendo entre 6 a 15 años y el 77,2% estaba con modalidad de trabajo híbrida. El 62% del total de la muestra se clasificó como “de vez en cuando estresado” y el 33,7% clasificó como “a menudo estresado”. No se encontraron relaciones significativas entre las variables sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales con el estrés percibido. Conclusiones Se aprecia que más de 90 % de los docentes, reconocen situaciones de la vida cotidiana como estresantes durante la pandemia, por lo cual es importante implementar postpandemia estrategias de intervención de la salud mental de los docentes, con la finalidad de prevenir complicaciones, favorecer la calidad de vida personal y laboral, y evitar un impacto negativo en la calidad de la docencia entregada.",

      "abstract": "The theory of self-efficacy (beliefs concerning one's capabilities to learn or perform behaviors at designated levels), has developed since A. Bandura's work (1977) and continues to be applied to a variety of educational settings and grade levels. This paper addresses various issues pertaining to self-efficacy in settings involving academic learning and performance. The paper begins with a discussion of self-efficacy theory as discussed by Bandura and Schunk. Measurement issues are discussed in terms of reliability and validity of self-efficacy measures. Empirical evidence is reviewed in several areas to help distinguish the operation of self-efficacy during learning from its role in performance settings: self-efficacy for learning; self-efficacy for performing learned behaviors; self-efficacy and motivation/self-regulation; and self-efficacy and goal orientations. Finally, the accuracy of self-appraisal with regard to self-efficacy is discussed. contains 34 references.

Romantic refusal, ostracism, betrayal, stigmatization, job termination, and other kinds of denial have the power to compromise the quality of people's lives. As a result, individuals are highly motivated to avoid social rejection, and, indeed, much of human behavior appears to be designed to prevent such experiences. With the widespread effects of real, anticipated, and even imagined refutations, psychologists have devoted their efforts on dissecting this topic under different psychological subspecialties (e.g. social, clinical, developmental, and personality). The goal of this book is to consolidate all related literatures to further understand the influences of interpersonal rejection on behavior and emotion, and also, to have identifiable areas for future research. Other topics covered include sensitivity, emotional responses, and personality moderators of reactions to rejection.",

Few psychological interventions directly address deficits in ASD such as social communication issues or repetitive behaviours. The objective here is to provide a framework for psychological interventions that directly address core deficits within the spectrum and also help with mental health and behavioural issues closely associated with it. From a research perspective, the framework allows the identification of gaps where additional psychological techniques are required and facilitates strategies for empirical research. For the clinical practitioner, a structure for psychological interventions is provided in order to facilitate the search for treatment options.",

      "abstract": "High achievement takes more than talent and hard work. It requires psychological preparedness, emotional and social competencies, attitudes, and beliefs that drive performance. These are the psychosocial variables associated with talent development. Researchers are beginning to attempt to tease out the mediating roles these variables play in achievement. Motivation is viewed as the most important factor for performance in a domain. The role of emotions in achievement has been widely studied across talent domains and contexts. Emotions influence engagement, motivation, cognitive resources, attention, and use of strategies. Hope, hopelessness, joy, anger, shame, anxiety, and pride are among the emotions examined, but anxiety is the feeling investigated most often. Anxiety and stress and their impact on performance have been widely investigated across domains and across cultures. Talent development is not a private enterprise. The role of social supports seems to change with the stages of talent development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper introduces a model of individual behavior based on identity, a person’s sense of self. The individual evaluates situations, that is, sets of available actions given a belief about the actions’ uncertain payoffs. In some situations, a psychological cost arises because the individual’s identity prescribes an action that differs from the one maximizing material benefits. The model shows that a common process of weighing psychological costs and material benefits drives the choice of both information and future opportunities. As a result, information avoidance is akin to preferring fewer opportunities, such as crossing the street to avoid a fundraiser. The model provides a coherent rationalization for diverse behaviors, including willful ignorance, opting out of social dilemmas, and excess entry into competitive environments. The psychological cost varies non-monotonically with the quality of information or with having more opportunities. Non-monotonicity complicates the identification of prescriptions from behavior, a difficulty that is partially resolvable by observing specific choices.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A general common sense model of interactive teacher decisions is presented. The model assumes that the teacher wishes to choose actions that are appropriate to the situation and to the goals of her teaching. The decision process is thought to include perception, judgement and choice of behaviour from the teacher's behavioural repertoire, but as a result of the immediacy of classroom situations and the teacher's limited information processing capacity, the process may be partly unconscious and the decisions seem spontaneous. The process is affected, consciously or unconsciously, by knowledge variables and emotional variables. Interactive teaching is viewed as consisting of a series of such situations. Research on teacher decision‐making in simulated classroom situations is recommended. It is suggested that teacher education should include discussion of classroom situations and training in interactive decision‐making and the value of such programmes should be studied.",

Mental well-being is important at any stage of life, from infancy to adulthood. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders and eating disorders are extremely predominant and have been shown to influence the physical disposition of an individual. Methods of machine learning have recently been applied to support mental health domains. The aim of this chapter is to propose a novel architecture to identify the presence of mental disorder based on facial expressions that are extracted from different images captured during the human-computer interactive evaluation process. The proposed architecture can be used in the near future as a basis for the various mental illness prediction systems based on machine learning techniques.",

El grado de autoeficacia reconocido puede depender de procesos psicobiologicos como del contexto historico-social del sujeto. Cuando un sujeto se percibe con limitaciones reales o imaginadas y las magnifica, acepta negativamente la situacion y comienza a comportarse en funcion de esa idea; el entorno reacciona en consecuencia y tratar al sujeto como incapaz, reforzando la percepcion negativa. Los roles dentro de los cuales los adultos mayores son socialmente ubicados reprimen el cultivo y mantenimiento de la autoeficacia percibida. En funcion de esto, se evaluo el grado de autoeficacia percibida en una muestra de 240 adultos mayores argentinos, mediante una escala especifica, comparando sujetos segun genero, grupo etario y estado civil, comparando luego con resultados internacionales. El grado de Autoeficacia, expresado por los AM argentinos, en general responde a una performance bastante elevada, se sienten y reconocen eficaces para enfrentar la realidad; sin embargo, hay influencia de aspectos afectivos y emocionales. Comparando con la muestra internacional, en la muestra argentina el grado de autoeficacia se mantiene en niveles moderados.

Self-efficacy is the belief about self capacity to achieve a task. Acnowledged self-efficcacy degree can depend on psychobiological processes as on subject’s historic-social environment. When a subject perceives himself with imagined o real limitations, and magnify them, he negatively accepts the situation, and begins to act according to the idea; the environment reacts according to that,and treats the subject as incapable, enforcing negative perception. The roles in which elder adults are subsumed in, are socially located, they repress perceived self-efficacy’s growth and support. As a function to this, it’s been evaluated the degree of perceived self-efficacy in a sample of 243 argentine elder adults, using an specific scale, comparing subjects according to gender, age group, civil state, comparing then with international results. Self-efficacy degree expressed by argentine EA, generally responds to a rather high performance, they feel and acknowledge themselves effective to face reality; however, there is influence of affective and emotional aspects. Comparing to an international sample, in argentine sample self-efficacy’s degree stands in moderate levels. We concluded that self-efficacy varies as a function of social-educative factors, and not only as a function of age.\r\nKey words\r\nSelf-efficacy Elder adults Ageism",

      "abstract": "This article aims to shed light on the decisive and influential role of the learner’s mental functioning in the process of learning and acquiring the tools of philosophical thinking, which are mainly represented in problematization, conceptialization, and argumention. Philosophical thinking, as a rational and conscious thinking, requires the learner to acquire and employ a set of skills such as: questioning, criticism and argumentation, analysis and synthesis, abstraction and generalization. However, the acquisition and employment of these various skills inevitably depends on his ability to process information; Attention, selection, storage, retrieval, and use. Accordingly, it has become necessary for the philosophy teacher to understand the nature of the learner’s cognitive functioning and mental activity, which the cognitive and emotional dimensions are mixed in a dynamic unit that cannot be separated or divided. Despite the importance of memory systems in the process of processing information, severe emotional pressures, such as anxiety and stress, can paralyze the ability of the memory system and hinder its performance of its functions, which negatively affects the process of learning and acquiring the tools of philosophical thinking and its basic competencies",

      "abstract": "During the last two decades, the term Emotional Intelligence (EI) in the workplace is studied very often. All jobs involve emotions and all emotions are important on the job. EI plays an important role in many areas of our lives especially in our careers. Some jobs do not require a great deal of Emotional Intelligence. These careers focus mainly on tasks which can be accomplished individually or by working with others in fixed, set, or structured ways. In fact, EI is just the thing that sets an individual apart from their colleagues and leads them to other success in the workplace. Some jobs put the employees in contact with other people, and involve working in informal teams, or require them to empathize with, and understand, others. If they don't have a high level of emotional intelligence, then they may find these careers to be difficult, or perhaps, less satisfying. Keeping the above in view, this article aims at finding out the relationship between EI and Nature of Occupation. This paper also tries to analyse the level of EI of the respondents of various fields like Teachers, Doctors and Nurses, Social Worker and Employees working in IT/ non IT organizations. The study applies Daniel Goleman’s mixed model of EI to examine the level of EI among the respondents of different job nature. The elements like Self-Awareness, Self Regulation, Self Motivation, Empathy, and Social skills are taken as the major Elements for this study. A sample of 172 data was collected using convenient sampling technique. Statistical tools like frequency, chi-square, Correlation, Independent Sample t-test and One Way Anova are used to derive the required output. The results of the study show that there is a significant relationship exists between EI and nature of occupation. The results pertaining to element-wise relationship and the level of EI with regard to nature of occupation are also discussed in detail.",

      "title": "Modelling social algorithms as design templates for educational software",
      "abstract": "Education involves a process of initiating learners into complex socio-cultural processes which may vary from culture to culture and even between institutions within the same culture, making it difficult to design versatile courseware which has some relevance for the social process to be mastered by learners. Moreover, social elements often operate intra- as well as extra-systemically in social processes, which makes it difficult for the courseware designer to differentiate between the commonalities and variables in learning processes. Yet in spite of the complexity of human social behaviour, psychologists have identified social algorithms which apply to various key domains, and which prepare young people for effective social functioning in a variety of life situations. It is the contention of this paper, based on doctoral research on modelling composition, that it is possible to identify social algorithms which underpin human learning, and which might form the basis for effective courseware, given that such programs would require customisable options so as to cater for the extra-systemic elements applying in various socio-cultural contexts. One of the means whereby social algorithms can be identified is provided by Franck’s modelling process, which uses the principle of reverse engineering. The modelling process is described in some detail, as is the central concept of the social mechanism (i.e. algorithm) with specific reference to the development of educational software in the form of a process-based writing tutor program.",

      "title": "Understanding and facilitating predictability for engagement in learning",
      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Condition (hereafter “autism”) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects the way an individual interacts with others and experiences the world around them. Current diagnostic criteria for autism include two core features, namely (a) difficulties in social interaction and communication, and (b) the presence of rigid and repetitive patterns of behaviours and limited personal. As a result of the autism features, autistic individuals often favour more predictable environments, as they generally have difficulty dealing with change. In the context of social skill learning, experiencing discomfort due to dealing with unpredictability is problematic as it prevents children from being in a state where they are ready to learn. Incorporating a robot in social skill learning might be helpful in that it can provide a highly predictable manner of learning social skills, as we can systematically control the predictability of the robot's behaviour. Indeed, the predictability of a robot is a commonly used argument for why robots may be promising tools for autism professionals working with autistic children.The effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions designed for social skill learning presumably depends --- in part --- on the robot’s predictability. Given its importance, the concept of predictability is currently not well understood. Moreover, while early studies on robots for autistic children have found that the robot can pique the children's interest and improve engagement in interventions, designing robots to sustain long-term engagement that leads to learning is difficult. The children are very different from each other in how autism affects the development of their cognitive, language, and intellectual ability, which needs to be taken into account for the child-robot interaction.In my dissertation, I investigate how we can design robots in such a way that they can facilitate engagement. We specifically looked at how the individual differences between autistic children influence the way they interact with a robot. Another major topic in my dissertation is that of the concept of predictability. We provided a novel conceptualization and studied how a robot’s predictability influences our social perception, as well as how it influences the engagement of autistic children.",

To explain the essence of «turbulence of thinking» and the ways of its formation from IPS point of view.«Turbulence of thinking» is a specific cognitive process, based on informal and heuristic approach to situational analysis and decision-making (experience, creativity, intuition, adroitness, inventiveness etc). Such way of thinking could be formed both by the way of focused actions from the state and civil society (informational culture formation, new type of educational space creation (so called «heuristic education»)) and by the way of personal self-improvement (lateral thinking, psychic energy management ability, definite personality aspects and behavioral strategies development).IPS threat because of various destructive turbulent phenomena is a very acute problem nowadays. There is need to find the ways of adequate reaction to this problem. Educational process changes to form corresponding informational cultural level for people, ability of heuristic thinking and, consequently, ability to stand effectively against various informational challenges and manipulative impacts are very necessary at present. The main personal protective mechanisms are informational security culture formation and informational self-defense ability development. Turbulence as a specific neuro-psychic phenomenon is an effective mechanism in the IPS structure and it has been formed by the means of actualization, special educational and self-educational personal procedures.",

It discusses the methodology of self-compassion research and reviews the increasingly large number of empirical studies that indicate self-compassion is a productive way of approaching distressing thoughts and emotions that engenders mental and physical well-being. It also reviews research that dispels common myths about self-compassion (e.g., that it is weak, selfish, self-indulgent or undermines motivation). Interventions designed to increase self-compassion, such as compassion-focused therapy and mindful self-compassion, are discussed. Finally, the review considers problematic issues in the field, such as the differential effects fallacy, and considers limitations and future research directions in the field of self-compassion research.",

      "abstract": "Para o desenvolvimento da teoria contábil, é importante identificar e discutir aspectos comportamentais que podem influenciar o processo de julgamento e de tomada de decisão dos preparadores das demonstrações contábeis. O estudo caracteriza-se como ensaio teórico, pois aborda os efeitos cognitivos que podem afetar esse processo. A principal contribuição deste método consiste em considerar de forma conjunta peças teóricas separadas e contemplar uma perspectiva integrativa. Diversas práticas contábeis podem gerar vieses cognitivos, porém nesse ensaio serão tratados somente vieses advindos de práticas que permitem julgamentos, desconsiderando aquelas não provenientes do comportamento desses profissionais. São efeitos cognitivos que podem afetar o comportamento dos preparadores: impulsividade, ausência de ceticismo, otimismo natural e pessimismo, familiaridade, ajuste heurístico, excesso de confiança, aversão à perda, aversão à mudança e complexidade da tarefa. Estes aspectos podem ocasionar a falta de comparabilidade nos julgamentos realizados pelos indivíduos, mediante julgamentos que diferem de acordo com traços de personalidade dos decisores. A reflexão acerca da discussão desses aspectos comportamentais aplicados à contabilidade contribui para o desenvolvimento da contabilidade como ciência, por meio da integração da psicologia à ciência contábil. Para esses aspectos, elaboram-se questões que podem ser adotadas em estudos futuros, por meio da realização de semiexperimentos com profissionais contábeis.",

      "abstract": "Background: The modern world is rife with complex challenges that require citizens to weigh multiple, conflicting claims and competing methods for discerning truth from falsehood. Such evaluations depend highly upon prior knowledge. Therefore, the goal of epistemic education is the cultivation of apt epistemic performance: successfully achieving valuable epistemic aims (e.g., evaluating conflicting claims, discerning truth from falsehood) through competent use of ideals and reliable processes across a range of contexts. However, educators cannot prepare people for every contentious claim they will encounter over their lifetime. Therefore, we investigated if and how apt epistemic performance developed in one discipline could be adapted or transferred for use in another discipline.Methods: We analyzed think-aloud protocol data gathered as experts from psychology, other social sciences (i.e., near transfer), and natural sciences (i.e., far transfer) grappled with a complex problem: psychology's replication crisis.Findings: An actor-oriented approach best captured how experts outside of psychology were able to near transfer or adapt epistemic performance; far transfer was more difficult.Contribution: Our findings suggest epistemic education for an informed citizenry should prioritize teaching disciplinary norms and practices as well as their scope and limitations, along with self-awareness of when transfer is and is not appropriate.",

Self‐efficacy refers to personal judgments of one's capability to organize and implement behaviors in specific situations. Students gain information about their level of self‐efficacy from self‐performances, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, and physiological indices. In forming efficacy judgments, people take into account factors such as perceived ability, task difficulty, effort expenditure, performance aids, and outcome patterns. Even when students acquire efficacy information from self‐performances, efficacy judgments are not mere reflections of those performances because educational practices differ in the type of information they convey about students' capabilities. Some experimental tests of these ideas are summarized along with their educational implications. The self‐efficacy framework is compared with locus of control, attribution, and self‐worth theories of achievement behavior.",

Différencier l’une et l’autre notion, c’est admettre et reconnaître les tactiques résilientes que les personnes en situation de handicap mettent en œuvre quotidiennement pour compenser le handicap. Ne pas le faire, c’est nier leurs efforts pour parvenir à se déplacer de façon autonome en situation ordinaire non-perturbée. L’intérêt de cette distinction sémantique est illustré par les résultats d’une enquête qualitative menée en 2012-2013 à Amiens et Paris. Alors qu’il est déjà complexe de faire avec une situation de handicap, faire face à l’aléa qui produit la situation de vulnérabilité relève alors d’un défi supplémentaire, beaucoup moins surmontable.",

      "title": "Percepción de los profesionales de salud mental: comparación España y México",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad Mental es una alteracion de tipo emocional, cognitivo y/o comportamental, en que quedan afectados procesos psicologicos basicos como son la emocion, la motivacion, la cognicion, la conciencia, la conducta, la percepcion, la sensacion, el aprendizaje, el lenguaje, etc. Socialmente existen actitudes de rechazo hacia estas personas y eso provoca el aislamiento y marginacion que desencadena en un proceso de estigmatizacion. El estigma afecta desde las propias personas que sufren la enfermedad, sus familiares, hasta la poblacion general, pasando por los/las profesionales que les atienden. El numero de estudios que han evaluado el estigma entre profesionales de salud mental no es muy abundante y la mayor parte han evaluado las creencias y actitudes entre profesionales de la psiquiatria y enfermeria psiquiatrica, y son pocos los estudios que han incluido otro tipo de profesionales, como especialistas en Psicologia o Trabajo social. Estos estudios coinciden al encontrar que los/las psiquiatras mantienen ciertas actitudes paternalistas y negativas, especialmente en cuanto a las limitadas posibilidades de recuperacion, la dificultad para informar a estas personas sobre su enfermedad, la complejidad de exponer a los familiares el diagnostico, su impredecibilidad, o la sensacion de incomodidad ante personas con enfermedad mental (e.g., Kingdon et al., 2004; Lauber et al., 2004). El proposito de este estudio es dar a conocer la percepcion de los/las profesionales que trabajan directamente con las personas que padecen enfermedad mental (psicologos/as, educadores/as sociales y trabajadores/as sociales) sobre su trabajo y los/las usuarios/as que atienden. Para ello se elaboro un cuestionario que incluia preguntas sobre las funciones en el trabajo de estos/as profesionales y su percepcion sobre las personas que sufren algun trastorno mental. En este estudio tomaron parte una muestra de profesionales de entre 26 y 45 anos mayoritariamente mujeres con estudios universitarios y del ambito rural, procedentes de Galicia, Espana y otra muestra de profesionales que residen en Hermosillo, Sonora mayores de 26 anos, mayoritariamente mujeres con estudios universitarios y del ambito urbano. Los resultados ponen de manifiesto que en ambas muestras los profesionales llevan mas de dos anos dedicandose a esta profesion la cual consideran que es gratificante. Ademas los datos muestran que estos/as profesionales perciben que los/as usuarios/as son poco participativos/as y que sus familiares apenas cooperan. En conclusion podemos destacar que tanto en Espana como en Mexico las familias de personas que padecen enfermedad mental son poco colaborativas y por lo tanto el trabajo queda a cargo de los/las profesionales.",

These research findings must be reconciled with conceptualisations that view \"memory\" as an independent cognitive function capable of being measured in absolute terms. A key feature of the various, non-conscious mental processes involves the ability of non-declarative memory to \"support long-lasting changes in performance following a single encounter\". A single near-death experience, such as a near-drowning or a serious auto accident, can alter an individual's sense of self and behaviour for years – irrespective of whether it is accessible to declarative memory. Multi-modular memory categories differ so greatly that it might be considered misleading to refer to them all using the same terminology: i.e. \"memories\". In addition, there are errors inherent in generalising from the results of controlled laboratory experiments on cognitive memory to judgements of capacity in real-life situations.",

A. F. Freed and S. Ehrlich emphasise the need for a framework that encompasses both functional and sequential dimensions and thus, they propose a two-part definition: questions solicit information, confirmation, or action; and questions create a conversational slot for the responsive turn. The chapter briefly outlines some core types and dimensions of questions. Closed and open questions have different uses and applications. They also play a key role in screening or initial assessments by many professionals.",

      "abstract": "Deviant behavior does not always imply clear deviation from norms towards social disadaptation, criminal or addictive behavior. Deviance may be situational or have a latent nature. Deviations in behavior can be caused by a number of reasons: temperament and character, intrapersonal features and social conditions. In theoretical review of the article, various approaches are considered in studying the problems and causes of deviation. Psychological approach reveals the problems of personality associated with self-worth, with internal inhibitions and desires that lead to a conflict of personality with oneself. Within the phenomenological approach, an individual holistic psychic experience underlying deviation is being described. The study is aimed at exploring the linkages of personal characteristics of students with the states they experience. The aim of the study is to identify subject-personal correlates of states that can determine certain deviations in behavior. The methods used are: McCrae-Costa \"Big Five\" five-factor personality questionnaire, the methodology of self-assessment (Budassi), Eysenck EPI personality questionnaire, J. Streliau method for diagnosis of temperament, Prokhorov \"Mental State Relief\" questionnaire. Correlation relations of subject-personal characteristics with mental states were revealed. It was shown that the characteristics of the actual state depend on the strength of excitation, the degree of fatigue, the operability and switchability of the nervous processes, as well as on the ability to regulate the behavior volitionally. These correlations, which determine the specificity of experiences and behavioral responses depending on a person’s subject-personal qualities, can determine certain deviations in behavior if a certain quality has a negative orientation.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a mental state caused by excessive stress that results in emotional instability and a reduction in an individual's performance capacity. Burnout is defined as, among other things, a fear of failure, a sense of powerlessness, and a sense of performance pressure. It has more to do with dealing with one's conscience than with dealing with society. Tiredness, a lack of sleep, a lack of inspiration and productivity, concentration issues, frequent headaches, and other factors all contribute to burnout. Burnout isn't just a problem for people in the business world; it can affect anyone, including students, stay-at-home moms, teachers, and others. Many people are affected by this, and they are unaware that they are \"burned out,\" therefore the symptoms go untreated, which can be problematic in the long term. It is possible to create a model that allows people to assess themselves using a curated set of criteria (factors) and estimate the rate of burnout. This paper gives an overview of various regression models offered in the existing literature for predicting employee burnout, and the best performing model is selected through a comparison based on different evaluation techniques.",

Tantangan ketika seseorang memasuki masa lanjut usia adalah bahwa mereka akan mengalami berbagai perubahan baik secara fisik, mental, psikososial dan spiritual sehingga mereka harus siap dengan berbagai perubahan yang terjadi. Salah satu perubahan fisik yang menjadi fokus disini adalah perubahan pada fungsi otak lansia, dimana kemampuan daya ingat akan mulai mengalami penurunan seiring bertambahnya usia. Dr Ni Wayan Suriastini, M Phil dari Survey Matter di 20th Asia Passific Regional Conference Alzheimer Disease Intrenational menambahkan prevalensi demensia di DIY ternyata masuk kategori lebih tinggi dibandingkan prevalensi secara global. Faktor risiko yang menyebabkan terjadinya demensia ini dikaitkan dengan kurangnya aktivitas yang menstimulasi otak. Demensia ditandai dengan seringnya mengulang pertanyaan atau cerita yang sama, kurangnya partisipasi dalam hobi sebelumnya, meningkatnya kecelakaan, dan janji yang terlewat. Demensia memang tidak bisa dicegah tetapi ada salah satu cara yang bisa dilakukan untuk pemeliharaan fungsi kognitif pada lansia, yaitu dengan menyusun puzzle yang didesain khusus. Tujuan: Mengetahui pengaruh modifikasi puzzle terhadap pemeliharaan fungsi kognitif pada lansia. Metode: Penelitian quasi-eksperimental dengan pendekatan one group pre test dan post test melibatkan 60 responden lansia dengan teknik cluster sampling. Kelompok intervensi mendapatkan perlakuan dengan pemberian puzzle selama dua kali seminggu selama dua minggu berturut-turut. Instrument MoCA-Ina digunakan untuk melihat fungsi kognitif lansia. Analisa data dilakukan dengan SPSS menggunakan uji statistic Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Hasil: Terdapat pengaruh pada kelompok intervensi dibandingkan kelompok control dengan Asymp.

      "abstract": "Introduction. In studies of information searching, people are often characterised with perpetual physical, sensory and cognitive abilities. Situational factors that may affect human abilities are less considered, although they may have an impact on information searching behaviour. For example, a person with dyslexia may struggle with inputting correctly spelled queries. Spelling skills, however, may also be influenced by fatigue, illness, or using a mobile phone while walking. All types of users can therefore at certain times experience challenges related to query input. Method. This theoretical paper explores the concept of situated abilities in the context of information searching. Eight personas are constructed and used in a discussion of how a change of perspective on human abilities can provide a valuable contribution to research. Analysis. The personas are based upon empirical findings of user behaviour and are discussed in relation to theoretical frameworks and models. Results. Human abilities are dynamic and affected by a variety of situational factors. All people experience temporary impairments during their lives. It would therefore be purposeful to reorient information searching research by applying a situated abilities perspective. Conclusion. A situated abilities perspective may result in more inclusive search systems for all types of users.",

      "title": "Self-Motives",
      "abstract": "All normal adult human beings possess a self and an identity. Their evolutionary emergence may be partly understood as the result of humans developing several sophisticated cognitive capacities. But having emerged, self and identity now serve as objects of keen motivational concern. Accordingly, various motives relating to self and identity have been conceptualized, theorized, and researched. These include four <italic>self-evaluation motives</italic> (SEMs; self-enhancement, self-assessment, self-verification, and self-improvement), six identity motives (<italic>IMs</italic>; self-esteem, continuity, distinctiveness, belongingness, efficacy, and meaning), and three <italic>fundamental needs</italic> (FNs; efficacy, autonomy, and relatedness). Some of these self-motives represent very general self-appraisals that people strive for, while others represent more specific preconditions for thriving psychologically, and there is some overlap. The motive to rationally self-assess (discover the truth about oneself) has obvious pragmatic utility. But it competes with the motives to irrationally self-enhance (discover good things about oneself) and to irrationally self-verify (confirm preconceptions about oneself), whose utility is complex and debated. A more active, but also reality-oriented, motive to self-improve (make oneself better) supplements them. Much research on these SEMs addresses the extent to which, and the conditions under which, one motive prevails over another, with the potency of each being occasionally subject to radical skepticism. Controversies also abound over the criteria for validly inferring the operation of SEMs, as many purported measures are dogged by nonmotivational confounds. As regards IMs and FNs, these deal with more domain-specific strivings, such as preserving a sense of who one is over time, or taking charge of one’s own destiny. Most may be tentatively classified into three categories of strivings: to have an impact on the world (agency), to make sense of the world (coherence), or to relate to others in the world (communion). In human beings, all such strivings are intimately intertwined with self and identity. Moreover, the fact such motives and needs exist, and durably operate, points to them serving some important adaptive function. Much applied research accordingly indicates that satisfying them promotes better psychological health and occupational performance. For SEMs, however, a more nuanced picture emerges. In particular, when people successfully self-enhance (i.e., have high self-esteem), they feel subjectively better, and self-report many benefits, but the evidence for objective advantages is thinner. Moreover, although low self-esteem may impair relationships through self-doubt, people who engage in antisocial behavior generally have high self-esteem. Regardless, the centrality of self and identity to human motivation can scarcely be overestimated. Who we are, compared to who we strive to be, is a key determinant of our well-being, and at least a modest determinant of important life outcomes.",

Themes that abound include communication, coping, ethics, the family, caregiving, quality of life, death and dying, psychiatric disorders, suffering, and the many expressions of distress. Many study designs are possible to explore these themes, often with complementary quantitative and qualitative components. This chapter summarizes the psychometric properties of many of the instruments that are commonly employed in such studies, and describes quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods designs used. The goal is to strengthen research design and optimize research outcomes to benefit the discipline.",

This is consistent with an understanding of the presentation of dementia which goes beyond neuropathological and neuropsychological changes. The construct may help make sense of findings relating to the potentially preventative qualities of a diverse range of ‘cognitive’ activities and of social networks, as well as of education. However, caution is required in relation to how cognitive impairment is evaluated and defined, to avoid confounds such as has been the case with level of education.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the nature and peculiarities of students’ critical thinking on the basis of the analysis of domestic and foreign researches. It is argued that critical thinking is manifested in the ability of a person (natural or acquired) to independently evaluate the phenomena of surrounding reality, scientific knowledge, thoughts and statements of other people, the ability to see their positive and negative sides; as well as striving for a better, more optimal solution to the problems, to viewing the existing dogmas, stereotypes, and traditions.The main features of critical thinking are: the ability of a person to independently analyze information, determine its essence, compare with other information and make their own conclusions; ability to see mistakes or artificial distortions in the arguments of partners and other sources of information, review their positions if they are not critical; ability to recognize propaganda, that is, a deliberate effort on the part of the certain social groups or leaders to influence the minds and positions of the masses; ability to evaluate social phenomena, political actions, actions of social and political leaders and individuals from the point of view of a human morality; presence of a reasonable amount of doubt skepticism, the desire to find better solutions, actions, conclusions in specific situations; principles, courage in defending their positions, views, faith; openness to the perception of other views, positions, respect for their diversity. Thus, on the basis of the analysis of modern English textbooks, it was found out that the necessary material for the fostering of critical thinking while reading foreign language texts is not enough. This necessitates the refinement of a number of techniques and methods for fostering critical thinking based on the material of these textbooks.The technique of fostering critical thinking in the study of English is revealed, which includes the following stages: “challenge ‒ comprehension of content – reflection”, which reproduce three stages of a single process of the teacher’s and his students movement from the set goals to the results of mastering a new material.",

The contemporary roots of psychoeducation are traced from an early era serving to set the stage for psychotherapy as an educational process, to the behavior modification era, to the community mental health era. Content ofpsychoeducation is discussed in terms of general skills (i.e., communication skills, interpersonal skills, relationship skills, etc.) and specific skills (i.e., coping with frustration, sexual satisfaction, handling aggressive impulses, etc.). It is concluded psychoeducation content is limited only by the imagination of the persons seekinghelp and by the ability of the psychological practitioner to be innovative and creative enough to design a systematic program for teaching clients the psychological self-help that will make their lives more fulfilling.",

Evidence of impact of the unconscious functioning is presented. The unconscious is characterised as being a responsive, contextual, and autonomous participant of human-computer interaction. The unconscious participation occurs independently of one's cognitive and educational levels and, if ignored, leads to learning inefficiencies and compulsive behaviours, illustrations of which are provided. Three practical approaches to a study of subjective user experience are outlined as follows: (a) tracing operant conditioning effects of software, (b) registering signs of brain activity psychological or information processing meaning of which is well-explored and (c) exploring submodality interfaces. Implications for improvement of current usability study methods, such as eye-tracking, are generally considered. Conclusions consider advantages and disadvantages of unconscious-embracing design and remind about a loss of human evolutionary choices if unconscious participation is ignored, complicated or blocked in interaction with computer interfaces and built environment.",

However, defined here is an expanded concept called triadic dispositions which emphasizes (a) inclinations, which may reflect motivation, habit, policy, or other factors; (b) sensitivity to occasion; and (c) abilities themselves. Advanced is a list of seven general dispositions that are argued to be collectively sufficient and individually necessary for a general characterization of good thinking. For example, these include the disposition to be broad and adventurous, the disposition toward sustained intellectual curiosity, and the disposition to be metacognitive. Finally, it is argued that a dispositional perspective on good thinking is a generative way of approaching issues concerning theories of thinking, the generality of thinking abilities, cnceptual development, culture, and education",

The current trend of research and clinical practice is to give more importance to cognitive dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. There are numerous studies that highlighted the cognitive alterations as the core deficit in MDD and BD, observed across several domains (e.g., executive function, working memory, attention). There are also numerous tools that allow the identification of these cognitive deficits, as well as assessment tools. But are these, really, effective and usable in daily clinical practice? Are they accepted by patients? Could relying only these tools run the risk of forgetting the good clinical practice?

The question is whether the same or different wisdom strategies make sense for different life problems.A total of 416 persons (40.4 years old) read two situational vignettes, one about a work problem and one about a private problem. After each situational vignette, they were asked about their wisdom strategies regarding the respective situation. Wisdom strategies were measured by means of a self-rating wisdom scale.People agreed similarly with wisdom strategies for both situations. For both situations, participants agreed most strongly to use factual and procedural knowledge, perception and acceptance of emotions, value relativism and relativization of problems and aspirations. The order of the remaining eight wisdom strategies was the same for both situations.People agreed similarly with wisdom strategies regardless of the situation type. Wisdom strategies seem to be meaningful across different life problems. This is of interest for the design of interventions to promote psychological resilience.ZIEL: Weisheit kann verstanden werden als Fähigkeit, unlösbare Probleme zu lösen. Weisen Menschen gelingt es besser, verschiedene schwierige Lebenssituationen zu bewältigen. Dabei helfen ihnen Weisheitsstrategien. Fraglich ist, ob in verschiedenen schwierigen Lebenssituationen die gleichen oder verschiedene Weisheitsstrategien benötigt werden. Diese Studie geht deshalb der Frage nach, ob Menschen die gleichen oder unterschiedliche Weisheitsstrategien für sinnvoll halten, wenn sie mit zwei verschiedenen Lebensproblemen konfrontiert werden.Insgesamt 416 Personen (40,4 Jahre alt) lasen jeweils zwei Vignetten, eine zu einer beruflichen Problemsituation und eine zu einer privaten Problemsituation. Für jede Situation schätzten sie ein, wie stark sie den angebotenen Weisheitsstrategien, bezogen auf die jeweilige Situation, zustimmten. Die Weisheitsstrategien wurden mittels Selbstbeurteilungsfragebogen erfasst.Die Befragten stimmten den Weisheitsstrategien für beide Situationen ähnlich stark zu. Für beide Situationen stimmten sie am stärksten der Bedeutung von Fakten- und Problemlösewissen, Emotionswahrnehmung und -akzeptanz, Wertrelativismus sowie Problem- und Anspruchsrelativierung zu. Die Reihenfolge der übrigen acht Weisheitsstrategien ist für beide Situationen dieselbe.Menschen tendieren dazu, allgemeinen Weisheitsstrategien zuzustimmen, ungeachtet der situationsspezifischen Hinweisreize. Weisheitsstrategien werden über verschiedene Lebenssituationen hinweg für sinnvoll erachtet. Das ist bedeutsam für die Gestaltung von Präventions- und Interventionsmaßnahmen zur Förderung psychischer Resilienz.",

A holistic, rather than a scientific view, of knowledge is adopted. The discussion is also underpinned by a pragmatic approach that incorporates rational, emotional, psychological, and spiritual perspectives. While multiple worldviews are considered, the discussion is situated in an integrated participatory paradigm. A plan for developing mindfulness within organizations is described that includes consideration of multilayered development and ordered, unordered, and disordered organizational arenas. Complexities abound when both individual and group maturity levels on developmental layers diverge widely. Integrated wisdom is only achieved when consensual alignment is achieved. Integrated wisdom allows for this complex mix, is aware of the appropriate level and type of communication and or interaction required, and acts accordingly without prejudice or judgment. Implications for the future of mindfulness as a necessary skill for integrated wisdom are also explored.Request access from your librarian to read this chapter's full text.",

Although executive functions represent complex neuroscience, they also are apparent even in mundane behaviors. Executive functions developed over time for the purpose of helping individuals get along socially and to manage their emotions and behaviors. One of the challenges of learning about executive functions is that there is not a consensus about the exact processes that comprise them. The assorted executive functions are strongly heritable, which means that variance in these outcomes is attributable to genetic factors. It is during early childhood, when children transition from being at home to spending 30 to 40 hours per week at school, that the developmental course and implications of executive functions become clear.

      "abstract": "Abstract Encouraging Divergent ThinkingAbstract An important aspect of innovative problem solving is ideation. Ideation renders diverseideas to emerge, a combination of which can be used to solve a given problem. It allows studentsto explore multiple solutions, and more importantly to realize that usually there is no “one correctanswer” to a given problem. This paper focuses on team-based, interpersonal, individual hands-on activities aimed atencouraging divergent thinking. The activities allow students to change their point of view, avoidunnecessary assumptions, think outrageously and unexpectedly, and improvise using limitedavailable resources. Students are encouraged to find multiple, imaginative, intuitive (and counterintuitive), as well as common sense solutions. The activities are designed to accommodate multiple teaching/learning scenarios, such asindividual setting where each and every student is challenged with a specific problem; teamsettings that promote group divergent thinking, discussions and competitions; and, collectively,where all students generate ideas for a given challenge. Some activities are designed to be self-paced; others have strict time constraints, leading to ideation under pressure. The instructions forthe activities are very clear and concise allowing participants to be relieved from unnecessaryconstraints or assumptions. Following each activity, a short discussion session is facilitated toreflect on the activity’s goals, challenges and results. Even though some of the activities may notbe new, they are still introduced with different twist and/or with a new set of instructions. This paper describes a collection of different activities and their purpose, as well asmultiple solutions as shared by participants, some of which are unexpected, explorative andunconventional. Benefits acquired by the students are identified. An example for an activity is: Make the following sentence complete and correct: “This sentence has _____ letters.” By not making unnecessary assumptions, and allowing imaginations to run wild, studentshave come up with more than 125 meaningfully different solutions! The activities have been embedded in undergraduate courses, e.g., “Creativityand Innovation,” that were taught at three different universities with participants fromdifferent majors/colleges. A goal of all the related courses is to enhance innovative andcreative thinking abilities of students resulting in skills that can be used in problemsolving. The author shares these activities to allow people who teach creative andinnovative thinking to have “ready to use” class material, avoiding re-inventing andsearching for new activities. This paper lists the “better” activities that “survived”many years of experimentation with continuous improvements.",

The main theories of loneliness are social needs theory and cognitive processing theory. The former holds that loneliness is a response to unsatisfied social needs, while the latter refers to that loneliness arises because individuals are dissatisfied with the perceived interpersonal relationship. The harm of loneliness to students is mainly reflected in the study, interpersonal relationships, and negative emotion, which will lead to academic procrastination, decreased sense of achievement in learning, decreased social skills, anxiety, and depression. In the future, it is necessary to develop a more objective measurement of loneliness, find out its general mechanism, and conduct intervention research on more student groups.",

      "title": "Philosophical investigations on integrative complexity",
      "abstract": "Integrative complexity (IC) refers to a psychological construct, a measurement, and an experience. As a construct IC refers to our less than conscious thinking style in the face of difference or disagreement, how we process information, make decisions, solve problems. The cross-culturally validated empirical measurement frame of IC has predictive values. ’Low IC’ indicates a simple thinking style that is rigid and closed, a ’tunnel vision’ way of thinking that cannot respect or recognize different dimensions or perspectives on a topic, predicting destructive conflict or violence. An increasingly complex thinking style is able to ’see the big picture’, to differentiate and then integrate different dimensions and perspective on topics, linking them in some way, predicting more peaceful outcomes to conflict. As an experience, IC refers to less or more awareness of thoughts, emotion, and physical states in self and others related to IC management. The IC Thinking Research Group (University of Cambridge) pioneered the ’operationalization’ of the IC measure into an educational method, program and professional practices. The coding system i.e. empirical measurement frame, has been developed further to take elaborative aspects into account. The two components of complex thinking, differentiation and integration can each be broken down in two sub-components, elaborative and dialectical. In order to clarify the pros and cons of integrative complexity theory and its further developments in IC Thinking, it is useful to investigate its philosophical background. The theory and its applications are essentially dealing with language and the skill to use words or concepts. However it should be noted that besides the skills an essential part of the theory and its applications deals with our unconscious processes that are not explicitly controllable. An alternative for a philosophy of language behind the theory of integrative complexity is to consider an application of the use theory of meaning to explain its central components. Minimalist theory of fiction (MTF) was developed to explain the philosophical problems of fiction, but can also be applied to integrative complexity. Using words in different situations requires an ability to read contextual cues in order to follow the correct rules for the uses of words in particular contexts [1] . From these philosophical grounds, the theory of integrative complexity (IC) appears as a totality of the language games people are playing. One may be limited to one game, which means separating oneself from others, considering this game to be ultimately defining the correct uses of words. When one recognizes alternative games going on, it means reaching higher levels of IC. What is crucial is that this does not require a person to reject their core beliefs, since they may still be true. This approach challenges IC theory to improve its coding system but also offers possibilities for further developments and applications. [1] This ability, ’sensitivity to context’, is a key part of the IC management capacity. Article visualizations:",

      "abstract": "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder mitigated by social, behavioral and communication impairments.One of the models that try to explain such symptoms is that of neuropsychology, which offers deficits in Executive Functions (EFs), highlighting the component of cognitive flexibility.The cognitive flexibility construct is broad, however it is common to be related to the ability to alternate attentional focus and thinking, and the ability to adapt to changes in the environment.Thus, linking on the basis of symptoms of repetitive and stereotyped behavior in the ASD.Cognitive flexibility also appears to be correlated with Theory of Mind (ToM) and shared attention, too, at a level associated with social functioning.Literature states that FEs can improve with training.There are several intervention models for ASD, among them neuropsychological rehabilitation has been the focus of the study.Neuropsychological rehabilitation is a powerful model to remedy and develop cognitive skills that are impaired in some childhood diagnoses such as ASD.There is a scarcity of tools that work in the field of neuropsychological rehabilitation that meet both the need to develop cognitive flexibility and ecological changes, that is, an instrument that enhances the generalization of learning to situations of daily life.However, in this area there are and a common tool used in child rehabilitation involves playful activity.To meet these needs, the objective of this work is to develop a tool for stimulating cognitive flexibility in children with mild and verbal ASD, between 9 and 12 years old.The tool developed was a Role-Playing Game (RPG).The role-playing game involves a reenactment of a story, where participants must enact roles, considering the characteristics of their characters.Throughout the game, they are faced with challenges, which are problem situations that they must solve in a shared way.The dynamic game offers a favorable context for this flexible behavior practice and experience and meets the cognitive flexibility construct.For the development of the game, several steps were taken to reach the final model, which was tested in PUC-Rio -Certificação Digital Nº 1712307/CA a pilot group for later review and adaptation.The final model underwent an agreement assessment by expert judges who presented a 100% result for all items obtained.This result confirmed the hypothesis that the role-playing game, called Fables & Fantasies, estimated cognitive flexibility, fit to be used in the proposed group.The Fables & Fantasies RPG game stimulates cognitive flexibility through cognitive training, offering the opportunity and adequate support for this skill to be tried and practiced, with the integration of metacognitive and instructional. of the tool, and this objective composes the future perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Research on the interaction mechanism of cognitive evaluation, intellectual thinking, and burnout syndrome generally refers to academic fields related to individual psychology and burnout, such as individual cognitive appraisal, intellectual thinking, emotional labor, and burnout. It is a general term for psychology and mental health, with an interdisciplinary and applied nature. Unlike a single discipline, it presents complex attributes. During the research, it is not easy to conduct in-depth research by quantifying or applying traditional psychological models, and the diversity of research methods is somewhat limited. With the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence, the academic community has been paying more and more attention to psychology research methods. In recent years, scientists have begun to pay attention to the combination of innovation and interdisciplinarity, and the construction and application of big data and artificial intelligence technologies in psychology is a typical example. Considering the complexity of the research objects and the problems involved, how to effectively integrate big data, artificial intelligence technology, and psychology has become a problem that needs to be solved urgently in academic circles. This study analyzes applying the above theories to practice to provide theoretical foundations and practical references for promoting the interface of internal and external elements and innovation in this field.",

Souvent consideree comme une aptitude individuelle, la creativite est ici envisagee sous l'angle des facteurs socio-affectifs qui determinent les strategies cognitives de resolution. Ces facteurs sont lies aux caracteristiques de la situation creative en particulier le contexte de presentation des taches, ou l'interaction sociale. Ils influent sur la creativite par differents mecanismes comme l'interet pour la tache, le climat ressenti ou l'affect. Les resultats des quatre premieres experiences permettent de constater que la cooperation partielle entre deux individus favorise l'originalite et la flexibilite des reponses a une tache a solutions multiples tandis que la cooperation forte favorise plutot la fluidite. L'induction d'une procedure specifique d'originalite favorise l'originalite des reponses alors qu'une procedure quantitative favorise la fluidite et la flexibilite. Contrairement a ce que l'on constate pour des taches bien definies, la performance de realisation d'une tache a solution unique n'est pas amelioree par la cooperation ni par l'induction d'une procedure specifique de resolution. Trois autres experiences montrent que l'effet des affects positifs et negatifs se differencient en fonction des types de taches, des operations mentales qu'elle mobilisent et des indicateurs de la creativite. L'affect positif favorise la fluidite et la flexibilite des associations lorsque la tache admet un petit nombre de solutions et exige un traitement complexe de l'information. L'affect negatif favorise l'originalite des reponses a une tache a solutions multiples.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many controversies remain with respect to how best to work with individuals who are challenged by cognitive impairments. Yet in the last decade, there has been substantial new research and a proliferation of literature, which has served to clarify major principles underlying cognitive interventions, and specified training procedures and teaching techniques that have demonstrated some effectiveness. Increasingly, it is possible to identify what techniques are likely to work for a particular individual, based on a number of variables including their cognitive profile, level of insight, and capacity for self-regulation. Education, the development of compensatory behaviours, the use of specialised instructional techniques and the inclusion of activities to improve self awareness and self-efficacy are but a few of the important components of most efforts at rehabilitation for cognitive impairments. Cognitive rehabilitation must be creative, eclectic, functionally oriented, and based in a partnership between clients, families/caregivers, and professionals.",

      "abstract": "The executive functions constitute a range of high-order cognitive abilities which permit an individual to plan, control and monitor their behaviour. There is considerable evidence of executive functioning deficits in children with dyslexia. Given that dyslexia is a lifelong condition, it continues to have a documented impact on executive functioning in adulthood. The current chapter reviews this literature, addressing a range of executive functions studied under controlled laboratory conditions (inhibition, set shifting, fluency, planning and problem solving, and dual-task performance). In addition to understanding optimal performance in a controlled environment, it is important to understand the everyday impact of executive functioning deficits on adults with dyslexia. To this end, the current chapter also considers how the typical, day-to-day use of executive functions is affected by dyslexia. Several means by which executive functioning problems can be ameliorated are then considered. The chapter concludes by highlighting the challenge to theoretical accounts to deal adequately with executive functioning deficits within their explanatory frameworks and makes some suggestions for future research.",

      "title": "Many Facets of Imagination: What Really Matters in Engineering Ethics Instruction?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Engineering educators have used different strategies to incorporate ethics instruction into engineering curricula, often in response to the ABET requirements on students’ understanding of professional and ethical responsibility. The mainstream pedagogical approaches predominantly are case studies supplemented with moral theory and professional codes of ethics. Despite a greater emphasis on engineering culture, real-world practices, macroethics and the need for collective responses, and social justice in engineering ethics literature, it is still not surprising to see a continual reliance on presupposed “correct” responses for a given case; overemphasis on heroic actions and unusual mistakes without contextual considerations; and overlooking of the importance of society and peer culture in the teaching of ethics. In this paper, we argue that addressing imaginal capacity as a core component in ethics curriculum helps educators to move beyond isolated and product-oriented pictures of engineering ethics instruction and illustrate ways to bridge complexities embedded in how we think and how we relate to one another in society. The process of realization of different, and perhaps opposing, aims in everyday decision making and moving towards realization of another person’s existence and experiences should be a canon of the quality of ethics instruction. How can we then develop a dialogue to help engineers in dealing with ethical challenges? Ethics instruction that raises awareness of an individual’s process of making ethical decisions, presents ethics as a continuum from student experiences to professional ones, and humanizes conflicting perspectives is argued to effectively address higher level ethical decision processes. Student responses to macroethics and social justice decisions beyond the classroom can only be affected if ethics instruction goes beyond raising awareness of issues and instead influences student decision processes. We build on conceptual notions of the moral insight, illustrated by idealist and pragmatist scholar Josiah Royce, and the I-Thou and I-It attitudes, described by philosopher Martin Buber; and move to the resources in liberation theory and praxis and build on the notions used by Royce and Buber in connection with broader context. Then, we present preliminary ideas for converting theoretical perspectives into classroom praxis. Examples of modifications to an ethics curriculum that is currently in use for the senior-level engineering class, Design of Steel Structures, in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the United States are presented to initiate discussion. This curriculum has implemented a series of assignments that probe ethics development throughout the semester, complementing traditional ethics instruction in a companion course.",

      "title": "Habit as an Object of Spiritual and Intellectual Upbringing and Teaching",
      "abstract": "Based on the analysis of the phenomenon of habits and the known experience of working with it, the author proposes a methodology for getting rid of bad habits and forming useful ones for further implementation of this methodology in the secondary education system. A set of habits, in fact, constitute the peculiarities of a person's character, they are ways of interacting with others and methods of solving many life and professional problems. Peculiarities of perception and ways of thinking are also habits to a large extent. All of them emerged in the course of development as a kind of tool with which people try to adapt to the world around them and are stored in the subconscious as approved decisions (to do exactly that), i.e. they are established automatic behavioral programs in certain conditions. The ability to form your own habits is a chance to acquire the most useful and effective tools for successfully solving a wide variety of life and professional tasks, replacing outdated and ineffective ones. It is an opportunity to make your life more meaningful, productive and happy by improving yourself. The study has identified a number of features of the phenomenon that should be taken into account when working with habits, and provided recommendations for developing an understanding of the nature of habits, principles and sequence of working with them. Given the complexity of the process of working with habits, multiplied by the individual characteristics of each person, it is difficult to offer a detailed algorithm of actions, so a logical generalized scheme of work on habits is proposed, which can be individually filled with the implementation of these principles and techniques and become a personal algorithm. Recommendations are offered on the use of the main tool for working with habits - a tracker. The purposeful formation of habits makes it possible to solve three important life tasks; 1) good habits make a person better, i.e. they are part of development, self-improvement, they make a person healthier, stronger, more active, more efficient, while bad habits steal energy and time; 2) a good habit brings joy without negative consequences, and a person does not need to force himself or herself to do it, as it is done by automatic programs; 3) by honing the skills of combating bad habits, a person increases the ability to self-control, his or her will, discipline, organization and awareness, and they are very important in life in general, in life-creation.",

      "title": "How social cognition can inform social decision making",
      "abstract": "Social decision-making is often complex, requiring the decision-maker to make inferences of others' mental states in addition to engaging traditional decision-making processes like valuation and reward processing. A growing body of research in neuroeconomics has examined decision- making involving social and nonsocial stimuli to explore activity in brain regions such as the striatum and prefrontal cortex, largely ignoring the power of the social context. Perhaps more complex processes may influence decision-making in social versus nonsocial contexts. Years of social psychology and social neuroscience research have documented a multitude of processes (e.g. mental state inferences, impression formation, spontaneous trait inferences) that occur upon viewing another person. These processes rely on a network of brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus, temporal parietal junction, and precuneus among others. Undoubtedly, these social cognition processes affect social decision-making since mental state inferences occur spontaneously and automatically. Few studies have looked at how these social inference processes affect decision-making in a social context despite the capability of these inferences to serve as predictions that can guide future decision-making. Here we review and integrate the person perception and decision-making literatures to understand how social cognition can inform the study of social decision-making in a way that is consistent with both literatures. We identify gaps in both literatures—while behavioral economics largely ignores social processes that spontaneously occur upon viewing another person, social psychology has largely failed to talk about the implications of social cognition processes in an economic decision-making context—and examine the benefits of integrating social psychological theory with behavioral economic theory.",

      "abstract": "Is IQ destiny? Perhaps not nearly as much as humans think. This text argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life. Drawing on brain and behavioural research, the author shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of succeeding in life - one the author terms intelligence. Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people that excel. They are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion. As Goleman demonstrates, the personal costs of deficits in emotional intelligence can range from problems in marriage and poor physical health in adults to eating disorders and depression in children. But the news is hopeful. Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman's argument gives insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. Since the emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain's circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can benefit from this.",

      "title": "Personality Factors as Determinants of Psychological Well-Being among University Students",
      "abstract": "Sense of well-being is one of the most important goals which individuals strive for. It affects our perceptions of the external world such that we are able to view it with greater positivity and deal with day to day problems effectively. With an increasingly competitive existence, the pressures and challenges confronting the individual are extremely high, therefore it is difficult to maintain this sense of well-being at all stages of life. Adolescence and early adulthood are particularly demanding, because conflicts relating to quest for identity, concerns for academic success, career and uncertainty about the future all magnify the problems manifold. This is a phase in which several mental health disorders of adulthood appear and affect adjustment in society. Intellectual capacities increase and emotions intensify. The major tasks during this phase include establishing independence, realizing one’s identity and capabilities and preparing for adult self reliance. Psychological well-being has been defined as a dynamic state characterized by a reasonable amount of harmony between an individual’s abilities, needs and expectations, and environmental demands and opportunities (Levi, 1987). It is connotative as a harmonious satisfaction of one’s desires and goals (Chekola, 1975). Since personality is a core factor which determines our reactions and adjustments, psychological-well-being during such a stressed phase as adolescence should be studied within its perspective. It is important that researches which identify factors which contribute to psychological well-being should continue to be conducted in different contexts and with better methodologies. The present research aims to study the personality factors as determinants of psychological well-being amongst university students. Appropriate analysis will be conducted to explore the topic further.",

      "title": "A Two-tiered View on Acceptance.",
      "abstract": "Experimental studies in metacognition indicate that variety of norms are used by humans and some non-human agents to control and monitor their cognitive performances, such accuracy, comprehensiveness, intelligibility, coherence, relevance, or consensus. This diversity of epistemic norms motivates revision of the concept of acceptance. First, there are different forms of acceptance, corresponding to the specific epistemic norm(s) that constitute(s) them. Furthermore, acceptances need to include strategic component, from which the epistemic component is insulated, whose function is to adjust the epistemic output to expected utility. Experimental evidence suggests that this twotiered analysis of acceptance is empirically adequate. Relevance to AI is briefly discussed. Acceptance and its Norms Intelligent agency requires an ability to control and monitor one's cognitive states, e.g. retrieve memories, check one's perceptions or one's utterances. The aim of cognitive control is to acquire cognitively reliable properties, such retrieving correct answer. Intelligent agents in realistic settings, however, whether natural or artificial, need to track other epistemic norms beyond accuracy, such the comprehensiveness of list, the intelligibility of text, the coherence of story, the relevance of remark, or the consensuality of claim. Experimental studies in metacognition suggest that such norms are indeed used by human and some non-human agents to control and monitor their own cognitive performance (Goldsmith and Koriat, 2008, Couchman et al. 2010). Furthermore, the particular cognitive task in which performance is monitored has been shown to dictate which epistemic norm is appropriate to given context. The goal of this article is to sketch theory of acceptance that takes advantage of these studies. Acceptances, in contrast with beliefs, are generally recognized voluntary (Jeffrey 1956, Stalnaker 1987, Bratman 1999, Lehrer 2000, Velleman 2000, Frankish, 2004). Accepting is an epistemic action, involving deliberation, i.e. various forms of cognitive control and their associated norms. There is no consensus, however, about the norm(s) of acceptances. While for Velleman (2000) accepting is regarding proposition even though it not be really true, Cohen takes acceptance to be a policy for reasoning, (..) the policy of taking it premise that P (1992, 5, 7). For Stalnaker, sometimes it is reasonable to accept something that one knows or believes to be Circumstances where this is reasonable include cases where may greatly simplify an inquiry, where is to the or as close one needs to get for the purposes at hand. Granting that accepted propositions are subject to contextual variation in their sensitivity to evidence and truth, they cannot be freely agglomerated in coherence-preserving way, in contrast with beliefs (Stalnaker 1987). Finally, Bratman (1999) claims that acceptances conjoin epistemic and practical goals. These features of acceptance, however, fail to offer an intelligible and coherent picture of the epistemic of accepting, and of its role in practical reasoning and decision-making. First, it is left unclear how context of acceptance is to be construed in way that justifies applying fluctuating epistemic standards. Second, how can one possibly conjoin an epistemic requirement, which is essentially passively recognized and applied, and utility considerations, which require an active decision from the agent to what ought to be accepted in the circumstances? The Context Relevant to Accepting Why is accepting contextual, in way that judging is not? Merely saying that acceptances, being tied to action (Bratman, 1999), are sensitive to practical reasoning, is not viable explanation: other mental actions, such judgments, also tied to action, do not adjust their contents to considerations of practical reasoning. Saying that they are context-dependent because coherence, consistency, and relevance apply within the confines of the existing plan, rather to theoretical domain, does not explain how epistemic correctness survives instrumental adequacy. Our first proposal consists in the following claim: Utility dictate the norm of acceptance relevant to given context of action, without dictating the output of the corresponding acceptance. As said above, accepting can be driven, among other things, by goal of comprehensiveness, accuracy, intelligibility, consensus or coherence. For example, you accept that the shopping list you just reconstructed from memory is comprehensive (all the items previously listed are included), but not that it is accurate (new items are also mistakenly listed). On the proposed view, an acceptance is always indexed to its specific norm: proposition is never merely accepted, it is rather acceptedat or acceptedct etc. (where at is short for: accurate truth, and ct for comprehensive truth). Although the selection of particular epistemic goal responds to the practical features of one's plan, there is no compromise between epistemic and instrumental norms concerning the content of acceptances. Agents' epistemic confidence in acceptingn (accepting under norm n) is not influenced by the cost or benefit associated with wrong or right. Thus we don't need to endorse the view that an epistemic acceptance of is yielding to utility considerations, Bratman suggests. This proposal offers natural way out of puzzle, called the preface paradox, which is raised by traditional views about acceptance: A writer rationally accept that each statement in his book is while at the same time rationally accepting that his book contains at least one error (Makinson 1965). This puzzle is dissolved once it is realized that the author's epistemic goal is one of offering an ideally comprehensive presentation of his subject matter: it will thus not be contradictory for him to acceptct all the sentences in her book, while acceptingpl (accepting plausible or likely) that one of them is false. Hence, mental act of acceptancect does not allow aggregation of truth, because its aim is exhaustive (include all the relevant truths) rather than accurate truth (include only truths). Similarly, in the lottery puzzle, an agent acceptsat that there is one winning ticket in the one thousand tickets actually sold. It is rational for her, however, not to acceptpl that the single ticket she is disposed to buy is the winning one. From Epistemic to Strategic Acceptance The output of an epistemic acceptance so construed needs, however, to be adjusted to the final ends of the agent’s plan. The decision to act on one's epistemic acceptance, i.e., strategic acceptance, constitutes second, distinct step in accepting P. On our view, utility does not just influence the selection of certain epistemic norms of acceptance. It also influences decision in way that depart greatly from the cognitive output of epistemic acceptance. The first argument in favor of this two-step view of acceptance is conceptual. The existence of an autonomous level of epistemic acceptance enables agents to have stable epistemic map that is independent from local and unstable instrumental considerations. Thus, it is functionally adaptive to prevent the contents of epistemic evaluation from affected by utility and risk. Second, empirical evidence shows that agents are indeed able to adjust their cognitive control both function of their confidence in accepting P, and of the strategic importance of the decision to be finally taken. In situations where agents are forced to conduct cognitive task, strategic acceptance is ruled out: agents merely express their epistemic acceptance. In contrast, when agents can freely consider how to plan their action, given its stakes, they can refrain from acting on the unique basis of their epistemic acceptance. A decision mechanism is used to compare the probability for their acceptance correct and preset response criterion probability, based on the implicit or explicit payoffs for this particular decision. Here agents are allowed to strategically withhold or volunteer an answer according to their personal control policy (risk-aversive or risk-seeking), associated with the cost or benefit of respectively wrong or right (Koriat and Goldsmith, 1996). A third reason in favor of our two-tiered view is that strategic acceptance can be impaired in patients with schizophrenia, while epistemic acceptance is not (Koren et al. 2006): this suggests, again, that epistemic and strategic acceptances are cognitively distinct steps.",

Although standardized assessment is crucial for objectively evaluating patients, many individuals with severe-profound levels of ID perform at the floor of most assessments designed for their chronological age. Additionally, the presence of language and motor impairments may influence the individual's ability to perform a task, even when that task is meant to measure an unrelated construct leading to an underestimation of their true ability. This article provides an overview of the assessment protocols used by multiple groups working with individuals with severe-profound levels of ID, discusses considerations for obtaining high-quality assessment results, and suggests guidelines for standardizing these protocols across the field.",

      "abstract": "The classification of types of thinking is considered. The contradictions regarding the interpretation of such a stage of the creative process as incubation in the coordinate system of various creative tasks solving are analyzed. In particular, the differences that occur in solving problems of divergent thinking and insight problems are compared. Emphasis is placed on the results of the neural network modeling features study, which allow us to successfully predict the probability of creative tasks solving by the parameters of the subjects’ brain structures activity, in particular the manifestations of the phenomenon of insight. According to the results of the study of the productivity of thinking in people with different levels of intellectual development, the levels of the perceived object images characteristics are distinguished. The definition of the structurally comparable theory of problem solving by analogy is given. The advantages of the model of productive analogy and the results of its empirical verification are substantiated. Emphasis is placed on the main task of the psyche – to ensure its implementation, which involves the construction of temporary functional organs to overcome information uncertainty. The diagnostic and activating potential of free design tasks is considered. The role of an adequate picture of reality for the successful solution of the subject of the actual problem, in particular, the accuracy of the images built in the process of activity; transformation of images as a result of analogy, combination, reconstruction in accordance with the given conditions of the problem and the transformation of the creative tools of the subject in the direction of acquiring the signs of appropriate system. Peculiarities and tendencies in the dynamics of image transformation in the solution of creative tasks by senior pupils in the conditions of informational complications are established. The stages of the experimental task solving are described. The typology of constructive activity of the studied in the construction of the desired idea is determined. The ratio of the number of developed structures at each stage of the experimental task in relation to the types of structural activity is analyzed. The types of response of the respondents to the introduction of complex information conditions were established: the dominant tendency was to reduce the number of developed ideas, although against the background of a similar number of respondents whose reaction to the introduction of new conditions was indifferent.",

Memory performance is generally superior when events, including traumas, are central to identity. Prolonged trauma in childhood, however, can produce severe identity disturbances that may interfere with the encoding and later retrieval of personal semantic and autobiographical event information. High levels of emotion either at encoding or recall can also interfere with the creation of coherent narrative memories. For example, high levels of shock and fear when memories are recovered unexpectedly may lead to the experience of vivid flashbacks. Memory appraisals may also influence the sense that an event has been forgotten for a long time. Recovered memories, although unusual, do not contradict what we know about how memory works.",

Every fine-tuning of professional consciousness has specific descriptions that stipulate self-development and self-actualization personalities in professional activity. Becoming of professional consciousness of psychologist-beginner in the period of his adaptation to professional activity is a process in basis of that there is a removal of contradiction in the system «a man is a profession». The table of contents of this process is a decision of situation of difficulties with the high level of vagueness in professional activity due to the processes of reflection, that provide: actualization of structures of «I» at included in the situation of difficulty; exhausting of actualizated stereotypes of experience and templates of actions is in the situation of difficulty; discredit of stereotypes, templates in the context of the contradictions educed by a subject; opening of new principles of the structural overcoming of these contradictions with further by their practical realization. The result of this process is new formation: in the field of cognitive professional consciousness is realization of the valued orientations within the limits of profession, reasons and aims, objects, methods, facilities, knowledge, abilities, skills from the achievement of aims of professional activity, including to the role-play structure of professional group, acceptance of itself as a representative of this professional group, becoming of method of professional self-realization self-perfection, self-regulations; in a highly emotional sphere is a change of self-attitude to itself as to the representative of this professional group; in behavioral is satisfaction by a soba and by own professional activity.Becoming of professional consciousness is examined from the moment of establishment of relation a «man is a certain profession» at emotionally-valued level at forming of professional intentions and correlation of them with ideas about own possibilities.

In an adaptation period leading contradiction is a collision of ideal and real models of professional activity.

      "abstract": "This book focuses on the variability of metacognitive skills across cultures. Metacognition refers to the processes that enable agents to contextually control their first-order cognitive activity (e.g. perceiving, remembering, learning, or problem-solving) by monitoring them, i.e. assessing their likely success. It is involved in our daily observations, such as “I don’t remember where my keys are,” or “I understand your point.” These assessments may rely either on specialized feelings (e.g. the felt fluency involved in distinguishing familiar from new environments, informative from repetitive messages, difficult from easy cognitive tasks) or on folk theories about one’s own mental abilities. Variable and universal features associated with these dimensions are documented, using anthropological, linguistic, neuroscientific, and psychological evidence. Among the universal cross-cultural aspects of metacognition, children are found to be more sensitive to their own ignorance than to that of others, adults have an intuitive understanding of what counts as knowledge, and speakers are sensitive to the reliability of informational sources (independently of the way the information is linguistically expressed). On the other hand, an agent’s decisions to allocate effort, motivation to learn, and sense of being right or wrong in perceptions and memories (and other cognitive tasks) are shown to depend on specific transmitted goals, norms, and values. Metacognitive variability is seen to be modulated (among other factors) by variation in attention patterns (analytic or holistic), self-concepts (independent or interdependent), agentive properties (autonomous or heteronomous), childrearing style (individual or collective), and modes of learning (observational or pedagogical). New domains of metacognitive variability are studied, such as those generated by metacognition-oriented embodied practices (present in rituals and religious worship) and by culture-specific lay theories about subjective uncertainty and knowledge regarding natural or supernatural entities.",

These four abilities involve (a) perceiving emotions, (b) using emotions to facilitate cognitive activities, (c) understanding emotions, and (d) managing emotions in oneself and other people. Emotional intelligence is best measured as a set of abilities using tasks rather than self-judgment scales. When emotional intelligence is measured in this way it shows discriminant validity with respect to “cognitive” intelligence, personality traits, and social desirability, which is generally not the case for self-judgment measures. The ability-based measure of emotional intelligence most often used in research is the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), a reliable instrument that is associated with positive outcomes in social situations, families, educational settings, and the workplace. Promising interventions designed to improve emotional intelligence have been developed for school children and managers.

      "abstract": "Involving people with impairments in the design process is very challenging, especially when impairments affect cognitive functions or communication. People with such impairments may have substantial problems with thought processes and communication, including understanding abstractions, sequencing thoughts and actions, understanding symbols, and interpreting social cues. Many participatory design techniques are based on these processes and are therefore not usable, or need to be adjusted for people with impairments. This workshop aims to exchange experiences with participatory design techniques that were designed for, or adapted to people with impairments. Since many of these techniques are highly focused on specific target groups, a further aim is to extract general principles and to generate guidelines for involving users with impairments in the design process.",

      "title": "Sociocognitive development",
      "abstract": "As we have already seen in the Introduction, proponents of the sociocognitive approach to social norms contend that the normativity of judgments follows more from the necessities of our social functioning than from human motivations. In other words, normativity is grounded in social prescriptions rather than in supposedly universal values. One of the implications of this view is that judgment normativity cannot result from the pure maturation of a spontaneous tendency. It seems instead to be the outcome of genuine social learning processes through which the learner (child or adult) learns to attribute value (or utility) to normative judgments. This chapter will be devoted to studies that support this point of view, but before beginning, a few important points need to be made.",

The author raises the questions: whom the scholar is responsible to (his conscience, future and currently living generations), for what (scientific components of his development/discovery, their application and consequences), what type of responsibility (moral, legal). The author seeks answers on the basis of studying, scientific comprehension and analysis of the developing and existing mechanism, methods, and means for euthanasia as legally permitted or prohibited in the medical establishments. The ideas underlying the support and implementation of euthanasia are examined. The scientific novelty is substantiated by articulation of the problem: responsibility of a scholar (medical personnel, etc.) with regards to the practice (ban of a number of aspects in the practice) of euthanasia on the example of legislation of the countries, in which it is allowed (was allowed) or unwelcomed. Among the formulated conclusions is the idea that any approach is based on persuasions of a person; there is not special morality, a scholar always remains a human, with all the weaknesses and strength. Namely these persuasions lead the licensed medial practitioners toward creation of technologies, means and methods for alleviation of suffering and acceleration of death.",

The development of self-confidence is particularly relevant in school settings as confidence has also been shown to predict academic achievement. Self-efficacy has also been shown to be highly correlated with psychological well-being and positive mental health. As research continues to highlight the importance of a focus on \"non-cognitive factors\" such as confidence, together with the suggestion that self-confidence is potentially malleable, it could become an important target of intervention to improve academic achievement, mental toughness, resilience, and well-being. This chapter provides an overview of the scientific literature relating to self-confidence and self-efficacy and in particular interventions that have evidence for their development. The chapter concludes with a case study highlighting the application of relevant science to the development of self-confidence in a school setting.",

For this reason, there is a real danger that metacognitive illusions undermine cognitive performance. In this chapter, we present an overview of metacognitive illusions in the domains of learning, knowledge assessment, and thinking. On a theoretical level, the existence of metacognitive illusions indicates that people cannot directly access their cognition, but infer the state of their mind from cues and heuristics. The cues that produce metacognitive illusions are categorized into faulty beliefs about cognition and invalid non-analytic cues. This chapter discusses real-life consequences of metacognitive illusions and provides evidence-based recommendations for the mending of specific metacognitive illusions and for creating conditions that foster accurate metacognition.",

      "abstract": "Decision-making behavior is studied in many very different fields, from medicine and economics to psychology and neuroscience, with major contributions from mathematics and statistics, computer science, AI, and other technical disciplines. However the conceptualization of what decision-making is and methods for studying it vary greatly and this has resulted in fragmentation of the field. A theory that can accommodate various perspectives may facilitate interdisciplinary working. We present such a theory in which decision-making is articulated as a set of canonical functions that are sufficiently general to accommodate diverse viewpoints, yet sufficiently precise that they can be instantiated in different ways for specific theoretical or practical purposes. The canons cover the whole decision cycle, from the framing of a decision based on the goals, beliefs, and background knowledge of the decision-maker to the formulation of decision options, establishing preferences over them, and making commitments. Commitments can lead to the initiation of new decisions and any step in the cycle can incorporate reasoning about previous decisions and the rationales for them, and lead to revising or abandoning existing commitments. The theory situates decision-making with respect to other high-level cognitive capabilities like problem solving, planning, and collaborative decision-making. The canonical approach is assessed in three domains: cognitive and neuropsychology, artificial intelligence, and decision engineering.",

The context of clinical practice, the complexities of healthcare, clinicians’ roles, broader society alongside exponential advances in technology and treatment create circumstances that regularly imperil integrity. These circumstances create the conditions for burnout, disengagement, and imperiled patient care. Specifically, they foster powerlessness, frustration, anger, diminished moral responsiveness, disillusionment, and shame. The cumulative dynamic of moral distress results in myriad detrimental consequences affecting the bodies, emotions, minds, and souls of clinicians. Transforming these experiences requires a shift in orientation toward restoring and preserving integrity through the cultivation of capacities of moral resilience and strategies to foster systemic ethical practice.",

All learning has uncertain consequences, but learning from rare events is especially problematic. Learners see many idiosyncrasies and exogenous interference, tendencies that suppress learning on an organizational scale. Rare events also rouse uncertainty and bring on reactions to uncertainty such as wishful thinking, reliance on prior beliefs, biased probabilities, a search for more data, cautious action, and playing to audiences. The most important contingencies affecting these reactions are the content and strength of prior beliefs: people are unlikely to learn if they think they have nothing to learn. Although learning from rare events is statistically unusual, and effective learning from rare events is rare, both individuals and organizations can benefit significantly from active efforts to learn from rare events.",

      "abstract": "The absence of self-awareness is a crucial aspect in the symptomatology of various neurodegenerative disorders. This characteristic becomes relevant due to the strong implications it has on the patient's quality of life, on the effects that functional dependence has on the caregiver and on the efficacy of the therapy. Faced with a construct as complex as self-awareness, there are in the literature investigations on different aspects of this phenomenon, such as the creation of cognitive models, the study of the neural substrate and the research of appropriate assessment methods that can reliably detect this function. With regard to the assessment methods, there are methodologies in the literature that provide complementary information. The first modality is a quantitatively online measurement based on the discrepancy between the estimate of the patient of his performance and his actual performance, but often neglecting the ecological validity and the real functioning of the subject. The second kind collecting subjective information on the actual daily functioning of the patient resulting from clinical observation or interviews with the subject and caregivers, but obtaining offline information on the functioning of the subject, liable to bias that may imply an overestimation or underestimation of subject's ability. The absence of acknowledged metacognitive functional assessment with normative data to evaluate awareness winks at the emerging and increasingly consistent use of virtual reality (VR) also in the context of cognitive research and clinical assessment. This article aims to make a theoretical proposal regarding the use of this innovative and promising tool as a supplement to the assessment methods of self-awareness.",

Such elusive understanding of empathy has confused research, practice, and advancement of therapeutic principles. Empathy is the core of all social and intellectual transformation. Humankind is biologically programmed to use empathy for survival, health, and well-being. Pursuing and understanding empathy frees human capacity for wisdom. Studying the epistemology of empathy is operationally and scientifically relevant in the synthesis of an empathic practice theory. Clear epistemic definition and neuroscience provide the foundation for an expanding discovery of rational frameworks for a clinician’s empathic training and teaching. A clinician’s empathic ability requires competency in reflective, global, affective, cognitive, and interpersonal perspective-taking. Once understood, renewed curriculum for teaching and training are recommended that would produce more finite outcomes. Epistemic review culminates in empathy skills training over the course of curricula at the undergraduate (BSW) and graduate (MSW) levels.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces three new concepts: epistemic health, epistemic immunity, and epistemic inoculation. Epistemic health is a measure of how well an entity (e.g. person, community, nation) is functioning with regard to various epistemic goods or ideals. It is constituted by many different factors (e.g. possessing true beliefs, being disposed to make reliable inferences), is improved or degraded by many different things (e.g. research funding, social trust), and many different kinds of inquiry are relevant to its study. Epistemic immunity is the robustness with which an entity is resistant to performing certain kinds of epistemic activity, such as questioning certain ideas, believing certain sources, or making certain inferences. Epistemic inoculation occurs when social, political or cultural processes cause an entity to become immune to engaging in certain epistemic activities. After outlining each of these concepts, we close by considering some of the risks associated with attempts to improve others' epistemic health.",

      "abstract": "Mentalizing—inferring the mental states of others—continues to develop into and throughout adolescence. This observed increase in mentalizing sophistication is thought to aid adolescents in navigating increasingly complex social relationships and contexts. However, developmental science has not measured how mentalizing as a multifaceted construct is applied adaptively in social contexts, or how mentalizing strategies relate to functional outcomes, such as internalizing mental health concerns, in adolescence. This paper includes a review of the literature describing approaches to measure mentalizing strategies during adolescence. We also describe a theoretical perspective that may be harnessed to guide future studies designed to measure the influence of social environmental factors on the development of these mentalizing strategies during adolescence.",

All of these skills are aspects of cognition. Logical reasoning is one important aspect of cognitive development, along with others such as problem-solving, developing expertise in a particular field and creative thinking. This chapter considers some of the ways in which pupils' cognitive abilities develop and are identified, particularly logical reasoning, and discusses briefly some ideas about intelligence. Differences between children are apparent from an early age. At a given point in time, several factors may contribute to the pupil's capability, including their experience of similar tasks, their motivation to learn and cognitive abilities. Another important factor that is easily overlooked is the amount of knowledge an individual has acquired. People who are experts are much better at recognising patterns in information and using principles to solve problems.",

At the first level, cognition, individuals compute, memorize, read, perceive, solve problems, etc. At the second, metacognitive level, individuals monitor their own progress when they are engaged in these first-order tasks. At the third level, epistemic cognition, individuals reflect on the limits of knowing, the certainty of knowing, and criteria of knowing. Epistemic assumptions influence how individuals understand the nature of problems and decide what kinds of strategies are appropriate for solving them. While cognitive and metacognitive processes appear to develop in childhood and are used throughout the life span, current research on adult reasoning suggests that epistemic cognitive monitoring develops in the late adolescent and adult years.",

      "title": "Technical Leadership Skills Development Through Interactive Workshops",
      "abstract": "Abstract Technical Leadership Skills Development Through Interactive Workshops Exceptional performance in engineering or science positions and careers requires detailed knowledge of the fundamentals in a specific field and related areas, and the ability to apply that knowledge to solve problems. However, these capabilities are necessary but not sufficient conditions for career success. In leadership or management positions technically-trained individuals must interact effectively with other individuals and groups within and outside of the organization to ensure that appropriate directions, goals and performance are achieved. That is, success in such positions requires that leaders solve or address sociotechnical problems, wherein a heightened level of complexity exists due to the intersection and interdependence of technical and people problems or issues. Early career leaders often find these situations to be frustrating and confusing, and may conclude that responses from others are illogical. The ability to deal with such considerations requires non-technical skillsets and a modified mindset relative to the strict technical approaches that the leader (initially) possesses. Although management/business courses address some of the issues described, they are not taught from the standpoint of how a technical mindset approaches problems; this mindset typically results in frustration and discomfort for the new leader. Furthermore, business courses are generally focused on higher level leadership/management positions, e.g., Vice President or CEO. Students and early career engineers need insight and guidance when transitioning into technical leadership roles. Specifically, they need to gain awareness of the types of issues they will face and recognize that even if everyone thought logically about the problems encountered, solutions will still be difficult due to differences in values, priorities, biases, experiences, and personalities. Non-technical skills such as emotional intelligence, conflict management, and servant/shared leadership approaches are required to make reasonable decisions and establish/maintain a well-functioning and collegial team or organization. Most graduate programs lack the resources to offer separate courses in technical leadership. However, 1-3 hour workshops offer a way to impart awareness of various challenges implicit in early career leadership roles and to discuss methods to address specific sociotechnical problems. In this talk, a workshop approach to discuss reasons why technical mindsets often lead to frustration for leaders and followers will be described and methods to re-orient the mindset offered. The approach uses 3-5 member teams to discuss mini case-studies typically encountered in early (and later) career positions that confound and frustrate leaders. The example scenarios invoked are ambiguous in that they have no “correct answer”, but rather better or poorer approaches. After each group reports their suggestions and conclusions to the other workshop attendees, consequences of the approaches offered are stressed and discussed with respect to likely reactions by team members and higher level administrators.",

      "title": "Addressing the cognitive and social influence inhibitors during the ideation stages of technology roadmapping workshops",
      "abstract": "Technology roadmapping workshops are essentially a social mechanism for exploring, creating, shaping and implementing ideas. The front-end of a roadmapping session is based on brainstorming in order to tap into the group's diverse knowledge. The aim of this idea stimulation activity is to capture and share as many perspectives as possible across the full scope of the area of interest. The premise to such group brainstorming is that the sharing and exchange of ideas leads to cognitive stimulation resulting in a greater overall group idea generation performance in terms of the number, variety and originality of ideas. However, it must be recognized that the ideation stage in a roadmapping workshop is a complex psychosocial phenomenon with underlying cognitive and social processes. Thus, there are downsides to group interactions and these must be addressed in order to fully benefit from the power of a roadmapping workshop. This paper will highlight and discuss the key cognitive and social inhibitors involved. These include: production blocking, evaluation apprehension, free riding/social loafing, low norm setting/matching. Facilitation actions and process adjustments to counter such negative factors will be identified so as to provide a psychosocial basis for improving the running of roadmapping workshops.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to model feats easily accomplished by a human child, such as object recognition and speech comprehension. However, there are many limitations in the current capacity of AI to execute these tasks in practical settings. From a developmental psychology perspective, skills such as object recognition and speech comprehension are built on more fundamental underlying processes of attention and perception. However, these more fundamental psychological variables are difficult to model from a computational perspective. This paper proposes a novel mathematical model of basic psychological variables, including attention, salience, and surprise, using the method of system analogies. Established system analogies are still routinely used for pedagogical purposes, but they were originally applied to understand the basic laws of newer scientific domains. Here, analogy is employed to extend the well-established linear dynamic laws of physics and engineering into the domain of psychology. The fundamental principles that govern these psychological variables may provide building blocks that will afford the field of AI to more effectively model the workings of the human mind.",

Strengths based practice refers to the identification of 'strengths' within an individual, family, or community, which are then employed to aid in promoting self-fulfilment and healing in a client. Strengths-based practice is a deliberate shift away from language and practices based on a client's deficits or pathology--- a widespread approach that has dominated many fields within social science for some time--- to one that focuses on the client's strengths. This premise is not a new idea as it has existed in the writings and practice of many of the great philosophical leaders and social work practitioners.",

      "title": "The Search for Knowledge and the Avoidance of Knowledge",
      "abstract": "In the psychoanalytic setting, patients can develop a strong reaction to the therapeutic opportunity to gain new knowledge about themselves. This reaction to knowledge is manifested in the patient by walling it off, splitting it off, or attacking it and erasing it from one's internal experience. The avoidance of knowledge can be the result of various phantasy states that bring on defensive postures. Knowledge can be experienced as a persecutory threat to be avoided and defended against. Knowledge can also elicit depressive concerns of loss and separation. Issues of dependence and autonomy can be equated with knowledge and therefore learning must be warded off. As a result of any or all of these internal threats, the ego can instigate a moratorium on thinking and creativity, a shutdown on feeling, thinking, and learning. As will be shown in the case material, wanting to know can be offset by a greater defensive need to not know. Through projective identification cycles, knowledge is placed into the analyst and experienced as dangerous, unobtainable, or a gift one deserves to be given rather than earned. The patient in the case example demonstrates a more paranoid experience of knowledge and a more paranoid avoidance of learning and change. When paranoid phantasies drive the patient to destroy object-relational links between self and analyst, the transference becomes colored with the phantasy of knowledge being equal to dangerous dependence that leads to destruction of either self or object. Therefore, curiosity and learning are to be avoided. Change is no longer a safe option. Psychic change can only occur when past and current knowledge are allowed to be part of the ego's self<-->object world. In other words, Psychic change is possible when the ego is less restrictive and open to new self<-->object experience. Therefore, the ego must tolerate conflicted feelings and thoughts about the self and others for knowledge to be allowable and accessible. This is the core struggle for many patients and must be identified through interpretation of transference and phantasy for gradual working through to become a viable possibility.",

Several factors are discussed that must be addressed if psychosocial treatments are to be effective, including: (1) timing and duration of treatment; (2) individual differences in treatment needs; (3) the role of the person in treatment; (4) the limitations imposed by impairments in information processing; and (5) the need to base interventions on a compensatory model. Three rehabilitation strategies that have received considerable attention were then reviewed: social skills training (SST), cognitive rehabilitation, and vocational rehabilitation. SST is an effective teaching/training strategy, but it is not clear that the intervention can produce meaningful changes in community performance unless it is embedded in a comprehensive, community oriented intervention program. The potential for cognitive rehabilitation is less clear. A number of promising approaches have been developed, but the field is limited by a lack of understanding about precisely which neurocognitive parameters are critical for good community functioning, and questions about the malleability of the adult brain. Supportive employment, as exemplified by he integrated placement and support model, is an innovative new approach that helps place clients in competitive employment without a long period of preliminary rehabilitation and provides ongoing support in the real workplace. Initial results are very promising, although job retention and total hours clients are able to work remain problematic.",

Psychology often uses long self-report scales to measure various psychological attributes. Although they are useful in tapping into individuals’ psychological profiles, when applied in real, everyday settings to assess individual differences, people are most likely unwilling to complete them. With the pressing need to personalize digital health platforms to enhance retention and engagement, ultra-short versions of these psychological scales are needed to allow assessment of multiple attributes at the same time. We encourage regression analyses of each item, factor analyses, item response theory, ant colony optimization, and/or machine learning methods to empirically shorten psychological scales to facilitate personalization.

      "abstract": "As humans, we self-regulate whenever we adapt our emotions and actions to situational requirements and to internalized social standards and norms. Self-regulation encompasses skills such as paying attention, inhibiting reflexive actions, and delaying gratification. We need self-regulation for navigating in the social world (e.g., when we inhibit revealing a secret, even though it is tempting to tell it), academic life (e.g., when we study for the test, even though we would prefer to watch our favorite TV show), and much more -- indeed, in every aspect of life. While both environmental and genetic factors have direct, long-lasting influences on an individual's ability to self-regulate, these factors also interact with each other in critical ways. On one hand, environmental factors such as parental attachment can shape the epigenetics and the expression of the individual genotype; on the other hand, gene variations may increase vulnerability to certain environmental pathogens. This book presents self-regulation as a crucial link between genetic predisposition, early experience, and later adult functioning in society. Individual chapters examine what self-regulation is, how it functions, how genetic and environmental factors influence its development, how it affects social and academic competence in childhood and adulthood, what pathologies can emerge if it is under-developed, and how it might be fostered in children.

      "abstract": "This last and interdisciplinary chapter begins with the observation that in many psychological subdisciplines that call themselves \"cognitive,\" there is a continuous debate about the specific nature of the mental limitations across different populations. Research in the cognitive aging area focuses on comparisons between older and younger adults in different basic cognitive functions (e.g., attention, working memory) and higher order cognitive functions (e.g., reasoning, comprehension). Research in the cognitive psychopathology area centers around similar comparisons and distinctions among emotionally disturbed versus emotionally stable participants. Finally, in the social cognition area, cognitive limitations and biases produced by strong prejudice or stereotypes are central issues. Researchers from the previously-mentioned domains often refer to the same psychological mechanisms that might interfere with effective cognitive processing. Just to mention a few, these include lack of motivation or cognitive initiative, limited cognitive resources, inefficient inhibitory mechanisms, or oversimplified strategies of information processing. However, there are very few attempts to directly compare the mechanisms underlying those impairments and limitations across different research domains using the same cognitive tasks.",

Although the two constructs overlap and perform similar functions in our lives, they can be separated in terms of their assessment, conceptualization and characteristics. Chief proponents of emotional intelligence believe that it makes people better students, better employees, better managers, better soldiers etc. The above assertion suggests that overall emotional intelligence contributes to individual success in life over and above the level attributable to general intelligence. Although the debates generated by the introduction of emotional intelligence in the field of psychology have not been laid to rest, the author contends that an individual with optimum level of the two constructs will be more successful and better adjusted to life.",

Health literacy represents the cognitive and social skills, which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access, to understand and use information in ways, which promote and maintain good health. There are three types of health literacy: basic, functional and critical. Basic health literacy implies a fundamental understanding of health problem and the ability to comply with prescribed actions to remedy the problem. Functional health literacy involves more advanced knowledge and skills to function in everyday society and the ability to seek out information in order to respond to changing needs. The most advanced level of health literacy is critical health literacy. It implies a significant level of knowledge, personal skills and confidence to manage one's health, and the ability to take action to change the determinants of health in the environment. Although these levels of health literacy are widely examined but systematic point of view is missing. The goal of this article is to report the peculiarities of the health literacy education system.",

Criminal thinking is strongly related to recidivism, and therefore is regarded as an important target for intervention. Inadequate social problem-solving skills, associated with impulsivity and aggression have been implicated in offending behaviour. Research has demonstrated that alterations in criminal thinking are associated with changes in criminal behaviour. The chapter analyses two issues: the first being interventions to develop problem-solving skills with offenders generally, and the less researched area of interventions with offenders with intellectual disabilities. An important aspect of assessing the efficacy of interventions for criminal thinking is accurate assessment of the concept. The area of anger treatment has received possibly the greatest attention, with a number of studies employing wait- list control groups.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces three new concepts: epistemic health, epistemic immunity, and epistemic inoculation. Epistemic health is a measure of how well an entity (e.g. person, community, nation) is functioning with regard to various epistemic goods or ideals. It is constituted by many different factors (e.g. possessing true beliefs, being disposed to make reliable inferences), is improved or degraded by many different things (e.g. research funding, social trust), and many different kinds of inquiry are relevant to its study. Epistemic immunity is the robustness with which an entity is resistant to performing certain kinds of epistemic activity, such as questioning certain ideas, believing certain sources, or making certain inferences. Epistemic inoculation occurs when social, political or cultural processes cause an entity to become immune to engaging in certain epistemic activities. After outlining each of these concepts, we close by considering some of the risks associated with attempts to improve others’ epistemic health.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the peculiarities of the development of practical thinking in the professional activity of future law enforcement officers, as one of the types of thinking that regulates activity, ensuring its adequacy. Such thinking achieves its goals due to the fact that, along with the properties and nature of the object, as well as the peculiarities of the action situation, its conditions, as well as the means of implementation available in this case, are taken as the conditions of the task. The following psychological features are characteristic of practical thinking: observation, the ability to quickly move from thinking to action and back, the ability to see a problem, since the very formulation of a problem is an act of thinking that often requires a lot of hard work. Practical thinking is determined by such psychodynamic determinants as motivation - a set of psychological processes that direct human behavior (at high levels of development, future law enforcement officers are motivated to succeed); an attitude is an individual's tendency to a certain form of response, with the help of which this or that need can be satisfied; representative systems (auditory, visual, kinesthetic), the auditory sensory modality prevails in the subjects, which is expressed in the perception of information by ear and better memorization. All these psychodynamic determinants affect the development of practical thinking of future law enforcement officers. Key words: practical thinking, future law enforcement officers, professional activity, motivation for success, representative systems (auditory, visual, kinesthetic).",

Mindfulness skills are inherently related to top-down processes, such as awareness and reflection as well as bottom-up processes, such as emotional reappraisal, thus they can improve one’s cognitive and emotional regulation. Practitioners become more responsive, calm, and focused while experiencing less stress and distractions. Furthermore, mindfulness has been proven to foster stress resilience and create a great sense of interconnectedness so that it diminishes one’s possible involvement in impulsive behaviors. In addition, these techniques have multiple applications in modern medicine, working environments and school psychology, supported by ICTs to enhance practioners’ health status. Research can be focused on practioners’ mindfulness skills training and assessment through smartphones as a cost-effective and usable, every day treatment.&lt;/p&gt;",

The theory focuses on types, rather than just amount, of motivation, paying particular attention to autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation as predictors of performance, relational, and well-being outcomes. It also addresses the social conditions that enhance versus diminish these types of motivation, proposing and finding that the degrees to which basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported versus thwarted affect both the type and strength of motivation. SDT also examines people’s life goals or aspirations, showing differential relations of intrinsic versus extrinsic life goals to performance and psychological health. In this introduction we also briefly discuss recent developments within SDT concerning mindfulness and vitality, and highlight the applicability of SDT within applied domains, including work, relationships, parenting, education, virtual environments, sport, sustainability, health care, and psychotherapy.",

Initially described among healthcare professionals, burnout is now recognized in various fields, such as education and security. Its impact goes beyond the individual, compromising work quality and the functioning of organizations. This article reviews the main aspects of burnout, its impact on mental health, and the challenges of multidisciplinary care, emphasizing the importance of integrated strategies for effective prevention and treatment. This literature review was conducted using scientific publications found in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (VHL), PubMed, CAPES Journals Portal, and the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), with no time restrictions. Burnout is a syndrome that affects the mental health of workers, especially in high-demand professions such as healthcare, education, and security. It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low professional accomplishment, increasing the risk of disorders such as depression and anxiety. Early diagnosis is complex due to its similarity with other psychiatric conditions, which calls for better training of professionals. Effective treatment depends on a multidisciplinary approach involving different specialists. Furthermore, institutional policies that promote healthy work environments and preventive strategies are essential to reduce the impact of burnout and preserve workers’ well-being.",

The recognition and development of creative ideas requires mental effort, an open mind, searching seemingly unrelated fields and definition of the problem. Brainstorming is widely used to produce alternate ideas. Modifications of it are the Gordon Technique and Synectics. Morphological analysis and the examination of attributes are other aids to creativity. Recognition of a need, or of a new use of an old idea can be helpful. Management should encourage attempts at creativity. If the will exists, creativity can be developed by conscious effort instead of being left to chance.",

We also outline how organizational features and leadership factors can influence the ability to learn from failure. Finally, we examine how individual psychological characteristics, such as openness to new information, narcissism and paranoia can affect the ability of leaders to learn. All these factors combine to influence the extent to which individuals and the organizations in which they operate can learn from failure, or fail to do so.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Issue/Problem Obesity has grown into a global epidemic and represents a major challenge for public health, with rates of related comorbidities, healthcare, and societal costs continuing to rise. Current approaches to obesity prevention and management have had limited success, highlighting the need for new innovative strategies. Description The narrative surrounding obesity often assumes that a lack of individual's knowledge and willpower is at the root of the problem. However, behavioural insights suggest that the problem is more complex and that people's behaviour is often irrational and influenced by many factors, such as environment, habits, emotions, or social norms. These insights can be used to design interventions that nudge people towards healthier behaviours. Results Behavioural interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting healthier behaviours and reducing obesity rates in various settings. For example, digital weight loss programmes that incorporated behavioural strategies, such as goal-setting and self-monitoring, or GPS and physical activity trackers and video or exer-games can be used with success as vehicles for delivering such behavioural-informed interventions. Also, nudge interventions that include subtle changes either in our environment or in incentive-provision have proven to be effective. Lessons The use of behavioural insights in obesity prevention and management has the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public health policies. However, to ensure the success of these interventions, policymakers need to consider the context and target population, as well as the ethical implications of nudging people towards certain behaviours. More research is also needed to determine the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Overall, incorporating behavioural insights into public health policy can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions to the obesity epidemic.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p style=\"text-align: justify;\"&gt;&lt;span lang=\"EN-US\"&gt;The work is aimed at clarifying the concept of &amp;ldquo;soft skills&amp;rdquo;. The materials of the study of concepts, problems, and research of soft skills in a professional environment are presented. The topic of soft skills is extremely relevant, both Russian and foreign students do not exactly understand what soft skills are, which may be explained by the fact that there is currently no single approach to understanding them. The purpose of studying this problem is to review concepts, problems and research on the topic of soft skills in foreign and national scientific literature. The results obtained make it possible to say that soft skills is a broad concept, and does not include a strictly defined list of qualities or abilities. There is evidence that researchers attribute a different set of abilities to soft skills, while different abilities will be most significant for different professional fields. Separately, such abilities can be distinguished as: communication skills, leadership position, decision-making skills, responsibility, empathy, self-esteem, critical thinking, analytical thinking, emotional intelligence (often assessed as part of soft skills in foreign studies). The most effective methods for developing soft skills include: methods for early development, educational tasks related to information search and analysis, critical thinking development, self-management (including the formulation of action plans), teamwork skills, and the presence of social and humanitarian disciplines (&amp;ldquo;Philosophy\" and \"Sociology&amp;rdquo;), as well as specialized courses such as &amp;ldquo;Team Building&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Time Management&amp;rdquo;. It is also emphasized that the level of soft skills development among teachers is important for fostering soft skills in students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

In everyday life, people commit action slips that indicate losses of intentional control. Reason (1979) argues that \"central to the notion of error is the failure of 'planned actions' to achieve a desired outcome\" (p. 69). The key factor mediating action slips is the lack of close monitoring of ongoing activity by attentional control, even in a well-learned and familiar situation. In addition, these lapses also occur when exercising any well-learned behavior in daily life, particularly in states of reduced arousal and attention, such as during periods of extended wakefulness or sleep deprivation.

      "abstract": "Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Cognitive Processes Instruction in an Undergraduate Engineering Design Course Sequence I. Introduction Critical to effective and innovative design are the intentional thinking practices that go into the analysis and evaluation of a problem as well as the conception and development of a product or process. Using a variety of metacognitive processes promotes adaptive cognitive flexibility student designers need to design in a variety of contexts that address the inevitable problems the environment, human nature, and community needs precipitate. These skills are central to design instruction in sustainable societies in the new James Madison University School of Engineering. Our six-course, three-year developmental studio design sequence includes instruction in cognitive processes, that is, the intentional and directed intellectual processes and habits that foster effective thinking a designer employs to generate an idea or solve a problem. Learning to think well requires intentional changes: changes in thinking processes, and changes in everyday habits and routines. One does not employ new thinking skills in isolation; rather, it requires developing a lifestyle, behaviors, and attitudes that inspire and support the process of thinking and effective design problem solving. Design instruction in our six course undergraduate design sequence spans sophomore through senior years and focuses on sustainability in four contexts: environmental, socio- cultural, economic, and technical. Students learn to design (and re-design) for sustainability in all contexts and are required to build their designs. Throughout the program, students are required to design or re-design products and processes that are subject to sustainability criteria we developed for student projects. All our students are trained in the use of design tools, both electronic programs as well as hand tools and power tools. More specifically, following a general introduction to the foundations of cognitive processes found in psychology, and creative process found in two- and three-dimensional art instruction, we offer developmental instruction in the following areas: Metacognition and thinking processes—students engage in activities that require them to plan, reflect upon, and modify their own thinking processes and strategies, as well as adapt these methodologies to meet the needs of a specific design problem. Structured and unstructured thinking strategies—students practice and personalize (adapt to their own habits and lifestyle) such strategies as focused reflection, brainstorming, writing as thinking, systems thinking, drawing as thinking, visualization, listening, and non- argumentative conversation. Behavioral and lifestyle changes—students modify their daily habits and personal demeanors to more effectively conceptualize and utilize their time, as well as adjust their attitudes and learning style.",

Las teorizaciones sobre la reflexividad, si bien numerosas y heterogéneas, pueden agruparse en torno a conceptos clave de «conocimiento» y «sociedad». Para pasar de la teoría de la reflexividad a la práctica de la reflexividad es necesario estructurar el propio análisis identificando objetivo, niveles y herramientas propias de un «trabajador social reflexivo» capaz de conectar, en un ciclo sin fin, experiencia, reflexión y acción. Es útil focalizar tal actividad en específicos eventos particularmente significativos, es decir en «eventos críticos», como por ejemplo los propios errores profesionales. Esta reflexión se puede llevar a cabo como momento de meditación con uno mismo, especialmente cuando es articulada a través de la utilización de «estructuras» reflexivas (consistentes en baterías de preguntas), pero aún más provechoso resulta ser el beneficio obtenido de una de las numerosas formas disponibles (analíticas o creativas) de escritura reflexiva. Existe además una dimensión colectiva de la reflexión que permite también prevenir situaciones de burnout y ampliar el propio «campo visual» en la práctica cotidiana.",

      "abstract": "A l’heure actuelle, le role des emotions dans les apprentissages et les performances scolaires n’est plus a demontrer. Les mathematiques et, particulierement, certains contenus comme la resolution de problemes, sont affectes par la dimension emotionnelle. Effectivement, non seulement les eleves y experimentent des emotions negatives, mais il semblerait qu’ils eprouvent de la difficulte a reguler leurs emotions dans ce type de tâche. Ces constats ont conduit a une reconceptualisation de ce que requiert l’expertise en resolution de problemes. Cette derniere embrasse non seulement des connaissances et competences (meta)cognitives mais egalement emotionnelles. Cependant, ces connaissances et competences emotionnelles ne s’acquierent pas automatiquement, elles necessitent un apprentissage. Ce dernier, pour etre effectif, se doit d’etre situe au sein d’une discipline scolaire. Malgre un large consensus au sein des chercheurs sur l’importance de combiner les dimensions cognitives et emotionnelles, a notre connaissance, il n’existe pas, d’intervention disciplinairement situee qui vise le developpement conjoint de connaissances et competences (meta)cognitives et emotionnelles. Cette etude constitue une contribution en ce sens en ce qu’elle evalue, via un design qualitatif semi-experimental, les effets d’une intervention cognitive et emotionnelle sur les emotions, strategies de regulation emotionnelle et performances d’eleves de 9-12 ans. Trois conditions experimentales ont ete comparees (une intervention purement (meta)cognitive, une intervention purement emotionnelle et une intervention (meta)cognitive et emotionnelle combinee) avec une condition controle. Si, tant la condition « combinee » que la condition « cognition » apparaissent plus efficaces en termes d’utilisation correcte et flexible des strategies cognitives enseignees, la premiere se distingue, a son avantage, des conditions « cognition » et « controle » en termes de fierte et d’ennui, en promouvant l’utilisation de strategies de regulation emotionnelle fonctionnelles telles que le fait de relâcher son attention pendant quelques secondes ou de se convaincre de l’utilite de la tâche et, en decourageant le recours a des strategies de regulation dysfonctionnelles telles que le fait d’eviter la tâche.",

Coping strategies includes the totality of mechanisms of which one person has to cope with life situations, eventual problems or crisis. Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events. The optimization of these mechanisms through psychotherapy and/or counseling will allow the individuals to respond properly to the inner and external requirements and therefore to obtain a higher level of satisfaction in any domains of there life - personal, familial, social and professional. The optimization of coping strategies that would lead to efficiency, involves the mastering of such abilities like communication and team work that allow the correct assessment of the situation. Their social implication and the impact towards the others persons it facilitates the adequate requirement of help and obtaining the desired results. Of this aspect we can talk about the necessity of an assertive behaviour. Assertive behaviour implies the request of your own rights or the refusal of some duties in such simple, direct and open manner which has not the purpouse to deny, to attack or to manipulate the others. This attitude involving respect and consideration regarding your own person as well as others around you and it is well-known that an assertive behaviour is clear, open and direct communication. The goal of acting in an assertive way builds and improves people's ability to take charge in their own lives.",

Mental health represents a state of psychological, emotional, and social well-being leading individuals to enjoy life, cope with stress, work productively, realize their potential, and contribute to their community. An important construct at the heart of human functioning and performance is self-regulation. Self-awareness reflects the conscious knowledge that individuals have of their inner states and behaviors within a particular situation or context–it is thus essential for learning and performing. Self-awareness can be enhanced by multiple mental performance skills and strategies. One construct often linked to self-regulation and self-awareness is mindfulness. Self-awareness can be an outcome of self-regulation and mindfulness training. Self-regulation, self-awareness, and mindfulness are interrelated constructs that have been associated with favorable mental performance and mental health outcomes in sport.",

If the social loafing behaviour of the students persists then we cannot succeed in adopting collaborative strategies. One can achieve anything when one believes in one self. But one fails when one is having doubt in one self. The feeling of confidence is a positive state of vibration, where the subconscious mind is directed towards the success of the individuals. Self confident persons are ready to danger the condemnation of others since they usually belief their own ability. They have a tendency to acknowledge themselves; they don’t experience that they need to prove, to be acknowledged by others. Many researchers studied self confidence in relation to many variables like stress tolerance, managing work and task performance but not with social loafing. This study is an effort to going to social loafing tendency among senior secondary school students in relation to their self confidence.

Approaches from which its analysis has been addressed (e.g., sociological, health, legal, economic, psychological) even though they have enriched their knowledge, they have of course a disadvantage to agree on its definition and measurement.

      "title": "Leadership Dynamics: The Interplay of Cognition, Emotion, and Resilience",
      "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of modern organizations, effective leadership requires a blend of cognitive and emotional competencies that foster psychological safety, adaptability, and innovation (11,14). Psychological safety supports open communication, mutual trust, and inclusive dialogue, enabling teams to share ideas without fear of judgment or punishment (8). Emotional intelligence (EI) enhances leadership through increased self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, all of which contribute to a collaborative and high-performing work environment (15). Furthermore, resilience empowers leaders to overcome challenges, maintain motivation, and drive long-term organizational success (25).This article explores the interconnected roles of psychological safety, emotional intelligence, and resilience in leadership, drawing upon cognitive psychology, emotional intelligence theory, and organizational behavior research (12,9). A lack of these elements can reinforce cognitive biases, hinder innovation, and diminish team morale. Psychological safety helps reduce biases like groupthink, confirmation bias, and status quo bias by promoting diverse thinking and constructive dissent (20,28). Emotional intelligence reinforces psychological safety by fostering trust, emotional regulation, and effective interpersonal communication (3). Resilience supports leadership effectiveness by enabling recovery from setbacks and sustaining performance under pressure (7).To cultivate these essential traits, organizations can adopt strategies such as active listening, mindfulness practices, unconscious bias training, and nurturing a growth mindset (5,33). These approaches enhance team cohesion, promote adaptive thinking, and enable innovation. Ultimately, the integration of psychological safety, emotional intelligence, and resilience is not optional—it is vital to successful, sustainable leadership in the evolving workplace (11).",

Controversy exists around the conceptualization of EI , whether to consider EI an intelligence or a skill, and if the consideration of EI adds any unique predictive ability beyond general measures of personality and intelligence. Several scales of EI exist, each reflecting the variety of conceptualizations and definitions of the construct. Despite the academic debate surrounding EI , it has offered both theoretical and practical applications.",

      "title": "Creativity, Art and Learning: A Psycho‐Social Exploration of Uncertainty",
      "abstract": "Abstract What makes it possible for artists to stay with the anxieties and uncertainties of the creative process? This aspect of an artist's development is rarely theorised or addressed despite it being an essential aspect of creative practice. It is a capacity, similar to tacit knowing, that is gradually acquired and learnt, and cultivated over time as part of the process of practising art and being an artist. The role of tacit knowledge as a key aspect of fine art education is well documented and is a learning experience that artists are familiar with. However, what tends to get focused on in discussions about tacit knowing are the practical, usually physical and technical, aspects of learning from experience to the exclusion of a range of mental or psychological capacities that are also a fundamental part of the tacit knowing process and vital to the learning necessary to be an artist. These mental capacities, which include being able to tolerate high levels of excitability, periods of nothingness, chaos, uncertainty and not‐knowing, are also, I suggest, passed between tutor and student as a form of tacit knowledge. This article draws on the experience of one artist, both as a learner and as an emergent practising artist, in developing this ability. The role played by art tutors in supporting student artists to develop a capacity to stay with the anxieties of the creative process is also explored.",

      "title": "Disorders of Emotion",
      "abstract": "A general framework for the analysis of emotion is developed and applied to an understanding of emotional disorders. A normal emotional state is presumed to exist when a person is disposed to respond in a manner consistent with an appropriately constituted emotional role (syndrome) under conditions that legitimize involvement in the role. Enactment of an emotional role requires certain biosocial capacities, but the content of a role is determined primarily by social rules. Three kinds of rules may be distinguished, depending on whether they help create the emotional role in the first place (constitutive rules), specify the manner and circumstances under which the role may be enacted (regulative rules), and/or contribute to the strategic and skilled enactment of the role (procedural rules). Most common emotional disorders result when the rules of emotion are habitually misconstrued or misapplied, for example, due to physiological dysfunction, inadequate socialization, motivational distortion, and/or cognitive bias. Irrespective of the source, three levels of emotional disorders may be distinguished, depending on whether the rules affected are primarily constitutive (neuroticism), regulative (delinquency), or procedural (ineptitude). Anxiety represents a fourth kind of disorder, resulting from a breakdown in cognitive structures. Thus, anxiety is the antithesis of a rule-governed response, whether normal or abnormal. The threat of cognitive breakdown, and hence of anxiety, can contribute to the development of other, more highly structured disorders (e.g., a hysterical conversion reaction).",

In both situations, the individual or group becomes mentally bound by the parameters imposed by the other, constricting freedom to think and behave independently. I describe four subtypes: toxic, neurotic, communal, and presentational inveiglement, and provide clinical illustrations from group psychotherapy.",

Kemahiran ini akhirnya akan menjadi kekuatan yang berkekalan dan menjadi sebahagian daripada diri individu. Terdapat beberapa faktor yang menyumbang kepada daya tahan, sama ada faktor individu atau faktor persekitaran. Antara faktor yang menyumbang kepada daya tahan guru adalah seperti kecerdasan emosi, kecerdasan sosial dan kecerdasan spritual. Guru yang dikatakan kurang daya tahan tidak dapat menjalankan tugas dengan baik serta produktivitinya juga kurang dan ini seterusnya akan menjejaskan komitmen mereka.

      "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are recognized as key determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation for schizophrenia, which is intended to improve both cognition and functional outcome, has been shown to impact cognition regardless of quality of trial methodology used. However, the impact of cognitive remediation on functional outcomes is more variable. A number of recently published articles specifically address the issues impacting the effectiveness of cognitive remediation at improving psychosocial outcomes.In this review, studies published since 2011 have been summarized, with a particular focus on psychosocial outcomes. Cognitive remediation may include a focus on neurocognition and/or social cognition, but is increasingly integrative, targeting a range of cognitive skills. Psychosocial outcomes include quality of life, employment outcomes, academic functioning, and social functioning.The reviewed literature indicates that cognitive remediation is most likely to impact functional outcome when individuals are given opportunities to practice the cognitive skills in real-world settings. By integrating a cognitive remediation program with psychosocial rehabilitation programs, functional outcomes are enhanced. Cognitive remediation programs that do not solely rely on drill and practice, but instead incorporate strategy teaching and methods to address beliefs and motivation, are associated with better psychosocial outcomes.",

Studies that have examined resilience explore factors or characteristics that assist individuals to thrive from and in adversity. These protective factors are part of an individual’s general makeup. Some of these factors are considered genetic, such as a personality that is outgoing and social; however, many protective behaviors can be learned. Coping in the face of adversity involves emotional intelligence and resilience, both of which can be developed through support and education. In this context, fostering resilience and emotional intelligence has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for mental health consumers.",

      "abstract": "This work argues that cognitive development is experience driven, and processes entailed in acquiring information about the world are analyzed based on recent models of learning and induction. The way information is represented and accessed when performing cognitive tasks is considered paying particular attention to the implications of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models for cognitive development. The first half of the book contains analyses of human reasoning processes (drawing on PDP models of analogy), development of strategies, and task complexity -- all based on aspects of PDP representations. It is proposed that PDP representations become more differentiated with age, so more vectors can be processed in parallel, with the result that structures of greater complexity can be processed. This model gives an account of previously unexplained difficulties in children's reasoning, including some which were influential in stage theories. The second half of the book examines processes entailed in some representative cognitive developmental tasks, including transitive inference, deductive inference (categorical syllogisms), hypothesis testing, learning set acquisition, acquisition and transfer of relational structures, humor, hierarchical classification and inclusion, understanding of quantity, arithmetic word problems, algebra, conservation, mechanics, and the concept of mind. Process accounts of tasks are emphasized, based on applications of recent developments in cognitive science.",

      "title": "Subjectivity in a therapeutic process as a predictor of psychotherapeutic success",
      "abstract": "Reflections on the uniquely human dimensions of behavior over the last few decades have become a meeting space connecting different sciences. The holistic health model emphasizes the subjectivity of man. Humans are open and active, and remain in relationships with others; they relate to the world they live in and seek meaning. Subjectivity in the psychological perspective can be described in three ways: subjectivity as identity, individuality, specific experience of self; subjectivity as the ability to initiate, regulate, direct, and realize goal-oriented and autonomous activity; subjectivity as the application of one’s own system of values. Subjectivity or causality (core features agency) expresses itself in the ability to make choices and planning, but also to directing actions and the realization of plans. The motivation to begin psychotherapy is influenced by numerous motives and conditions. Internal motivation is the main subjective resource in therapy. People internally motivated function better in better areas of life. They are characterized by greater involvement, activity, trust in their own abilities, persistence, creativity, a feeling of self-worth and general well-being. They experience engagement and immersion in the activities they undertake. The experience of causality – understood as the experience of being the author of events, the experience of having influence over events – is the fundamental cause without which the feeling of self-causality will not appear during development. As noted by R. White, it is a fundamental experience for good functioning and coping with the challenges of life, including illness.",

      "title": "Examining of communication barriers of foreign students at the medical university of Karaganda",
      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of interethnic barriers of communication in the student sphere. It was studied how emotions prevent students from interacting with each other. The essence and classification of barriers are considered. The barrier is lived by a person as an insurmountable obstacle. As a result, he is not able to create and maintain communication links, during attempts he experiences strong negative experiences. This leads to low self-esteem, lack of ambition, dissatisfaction with yourself and your life, anxiety, guilt and the emergence of an inferiority complex. In psychology, the problem of communication barriers is given enough attention. Experts believe that the emergence of difficulties in communication contributes to individual experience. It affects the perception of information coming from the interlocutor, and does not allow you to look at the situation objectively. For most people, this process occurs unconsciously, so communication often becomes unproductive. Psychological causes are the result of personal aspects. These include differences in types of temperament, antipathy, secrecy, tightness, distrust.",

      "abstract": "Impairment in cognition is a prevalent and functionally significant symptom in people with serious and persistent mental illness who reside in rehabilitative residential settings. Difficulties in information processing may limit the extent to which an individual with serious and persistent mental illness will be able to meet their personal recovery goals, thus indicating a need for specialized intervention. Cognitive remediation (CR) is a behavioral treatment that directly targets the cognitive skills that have been empirically linked to functional skills and community outcomes. Residential programs offer a therapeutic milieu that is amenable to integrating CR using the treatment parameters that have been identified in empirical studies as contributing to CR efficacy. This article describes potential barriers to CR implementation and how those barriers can be overcome—optimally supporting residents’ ability to learn the skills critical for meeting functional goals and for supporting personal recovery.

In addition, the chapter presents theories of cognitive aging and addresses the ways in which changing goals (such as emotional goals) in old age can alter the processes and outcomes associated with cognitive operations. There is a wealth of research documenting age-related cognitive declines and impairments in areas such as decision making, reasoning, problem solving, category learning, and memory. However, in addition to addressing the potential difficulties older adults may experience when performing demanding cognitive operations, this chapter also examines certain situations and variables that have been shown to lessen or ameliorate age-related differences in performance. Lastly, the impact of training, expertise, and wisdom are discussed as they relate to successful cognitive aging.",

      "title": "Technological Assessment Methods: New Directions in the Assessment of Sexual Offending and Sexualised Violence",
      "abstract": "Accurate formulation of how psychological problems develop and are maintained is crucial in guiding clinical assessments and interventions. Genetic or biological vulnerabilities, activated by early life events can shape later difficulties, including those of emotional regulation, sexuality aggression, and interpersonal functioning. An incomplete, inaccurate, or inflexible formulation limits the identification of personal and situational risks markers, protective factors, and compromises the design of appropriate, collaborative interventions. Formulations should be comprehensive – integrating information from across the individual's lifespan – and multimodal – drawing from documented information, interviews, structured professional judgements, psychometric assessments, and technological methods that assess areas of functioning independently of the other methods. This chapter considers how the integration of such technological assessments can improve the accuracy of assessments, enhance the relevance of interventions, and remove biases, which are present in the development of psychometric measures (notably lack of diversity in norm groups), in the assessment process and in clinicians themselves. These assessments include analogues of impulsiveness, risky decision-making, reactive aggression, and sexual interests/paraphilias, by the use of virtual reality (VR), penile plethysmography, polygraphy, and implicit measures, such as time viewing, eye-tracking, and implicit association tests. The use and potential value of such methods are discussed throughout the chapter.",

      "abstract": "Research around the world has consistently shown that people with serious mental illness (SMI) are often subject to stronglyheld stigmatizing attitudes held by others in society (e.g., dangerousness, incompetence, inability to work). As a result, people with SMI often experience \"internalized stigma\" or \"self-stigma\" which reflects the process by which stigmatizing attitudes are internalized, leading to the loss of previously held or hoped for identities (e.g., self as student, self as worker, self as parent, etc.) and the adoption of identities based on stigmatizing views (e.g., self as dangerous, self as incompetent). In order to reduce the common devastating phenomenon of self-stigma, Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy (NECT) is a structured, groupbased treatment aimed to reduce self-stigma. It combines psychoeducation to help replace stigmatizing views about mental illness with empirical fndings, cognitive restructuring geared toward teaching skills to challenge negative beliefs about the self, and elements of narratology focused on enhancing one's ability to narrate one's life story. Since its development, nearly a decade ago, it has been implemented in fve different countries and fve languages and studied in three countries with results supporting its positive impact on decreasing self-stigma and improving other positive outcomes. In this paper we briefly review literature on stigma and self-stigma within the context of SMI, the need for treatment focused on decreasing self-stigma, the theoretical rational for the NECT, the format of the intervention and the existing published research.",

This article describes an alternative view that expert performance results from acquired cognitive and physiological adaptations due to extended deliberate practice. A review of evidence, such as historical increases in performance, the requirement of years of daily deliberate practice, and structural changes in the mediating mechanisms, questions the existence of individual differences that impose innate limits on performance attainable with deliberate practice. The proposed framework describes how the processes mediating normal development of ability and everyday skill acquisition differ from the extended acquisition of reproducibly superior (expert) performance and how perceived “giftedness” gives children access to superior training resources, resulting in developmental advantages.",

Some of the most important reasons for that are: that the people’s work is often described qualitatively, but not quantitatively; in most of the cases the action carried out by a human is part of a process shaped by the actions of other people involved in it; and in the complex of factors, physical and psychological, personality-related, qualifications, experience and knowledge, as well as the environment and the nature of work, which affect the human in the performance of his duties.",

Emotional Intelligence is an introduction to emotional intelligence in general but with reference to the workplace. In this work it discusses what emotional intelligence is and the importance of having self awareness, self management, awareness of others, and of relationship management. Emotions are one of the most important things and the most fundamental part of human experience. There is joy or pleasure when we do something and you lose, you are sad, or in the event that things do not appear the way it is supposed to we get envious or feel irritated. What is this emotion, what does it look like, what is contained within, how does it work on our thinking and other things in our life? Emotions are a difficult thing to define and come up with some sort of framework of how we can come to understand them. Complex concepts such as these lie somewhere at the intersection of philosophy, psychology and neuroscience.We define social and emotional learning (SEL) this way, which is important part of education and human development. SEL is the process by which all young people and adults acquire and apply knowledge and skills to become, based on their own needs and as members of acommunity develop healthy identities, manage emotions, set and accomplish personal and collective goals, define and resolve conflict, engage in responsible decision making, show empathy, and establish and maintain supportive relationships with eachother.",

This paper reviews research examining the physical substrates referred to as resource capacity, the role of sleep in protecting that capacity and the reaction of the system as it attempts to respond with effort to overcome the limitations on capacity caused by sleep loss. Effort is the extent to which an organism will exert itself beyond basic levels of functioning or attempt alternative strategies to maintain performance. The purpose of this review is to bring together research across sleep disciplines to clarify the substrates that constitute and influence capacity for performance, consider how the loss of sleep influences access to those resources, examine cortical, physiological, perceptual, behavioral and subjective effort responses and consider how these responses reflect a system reacting to changes in the resource environment. When sleep deprived, the ability to perform tasks that require additional energy is impaired and the ability of the system to overcome the deficiencies caused by sleep loss is limited. Taking on tasks that require effort including school work, meal preparation, pulling off the road to nap when driving drowsy appear to be more challenging during sleep loss. Sleep loss impacts the effort-related choices we make and those choices may influence our health and safety.",

      "title": "Development and Standardization of Mindfulness Qualities Scale for College Students",
      "abstract": "Mindfulness has found its rapid upsurge in varied fields of practical relevance. Starting from psychology it had percolated into medicine, neuroscience, education, business set-up and other societal organization. Mindfulness is the result of convergence of Religion (Buddhism) and Science. Mindfulness involves to the present moment addressed with certain qualities. Despite its beneficial impact, an authentic operational definition of mindfulness is yet to be unanimously accepted (Bishop, 2002). One way of conceptualizing mindfulness is to view it as an bestowed with specific qualities like acceptance, non striving nature etc., Attention with appropriate attitude constitutes mindfulness (Shapiro et al., 2006).The present scale under development focuses on the attitudinal components of mindfulness briefly known as mindfulness qualities. Operationally mindfulness is postulated as awareness to the present moment both internal and external with varied cognitive and affective qualitiesThe pioneer of this field Jon Kabat Zinn listed down 9 cognitive qualities- Non Striving, Non-Judgment, Acceptance, Patience, Trust, Openness to Experience, Letting go which are used as a basis to develop the tool. The 5 affective qualities listed by Jon Kabat Zinn, Shapiro, Schwartz, and Nhat Hanh are Gratitude, Gentleness, Generosity, Empathy, and Loving Kindness. By fostering these affective and cognitive qualities, we would be able to relate better with the present moment (Labbe, 2011). Most of the available scales of mindfulness focus on few of these qualities. The present study makes an effort to understand a holistic perspective of mindfulness qualities.Cognitive qualitiesNon-striving refers to being unattached to the results. It is the most misunderstood aspect of mindfulness. Present moment is the only available moment and thus by being in the present, desired future is automatically framed rather than being obsessed about the goal (Kabat-Zinn, 2012). Non Judgment enables maintaining a neutral attitude to the moment which enhances the experience of present moment (Labbe, 2011). Acceptance goes parallel with non judgment and provides an opportunity to accept all kinds of experiences. Acceptance reduces the denial of reality (Huxter, 2016). Patience enables experiencing the moment as it is without rushing their course. Patience is graceful waiting (Jamie Marich & Foreword by Christine Valters Paintner, 2015). Trust is the belief in one's own stance and natural course of happening. It takes time to essentially reap the benefits of mindfulness and a trustful stance is pivotal to stick on to the course of mindfulness (Alidina, 2014). Openness to experience initiates a beginner's perspective- one that is not colored by judgments, expectations. Indulgence in this quality of mindfulness opens up creative achievement (Kaufman & Gregoire, 2015). Letting go is the capacity to relieve oneself from thoughts, feelings, and experience after acknowledging them. Most of these qualities are entwined and has very minuscule difference.Affective qualitiesGratitude refers to appreciating moments in life. However human brain is wired in such a way that curses and banes are remembered to enable survival (Halliwell, 2015). Gratitude grows about the present moment (Fralich, 2013). Gentleness refers to the calm composure with which one handles oneselfas well as the environment. This quality fosters the possibility of and acceptance (Halliwell, 2015). Generosity is the capacity to offer others time, service, etc., without expecting returns (Labbe, 2011). Empathy refers to being able to understand what others are feeling without sympathizing or infantilizing the person. It is a quality that enables mindfully dealing with interpersonal relationship. Loving Kindness is the essence of affective quality that spreads a sense of compassion for all beings. It is compassion without discrimination (Didonna, 2008). …",

      "title": "Annual Research Review: Transdiagnostic neuroscience of child and adolescent mental disorders – differentiating decision making in attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety",
      "abstract": "Background Ineffective decision making is a major source of everyday functional impairment and reduced quality of life for young people with mental disorders. However, very little is known about what distinguishes decision making by individuals with different disorders or the neuropsychological processes or brain systems underlying these. This is the focus of the current review. Scope and methodology We first propose a neuroeconomic model of the decision‐making process with separate stages for the prechoice evaluation of expected utility of future options; choice execution and postchoice management; the appraisal of outcome against expectation; and the updating of value estimates to guide future decisions. According to the proposed model, decision making is mediated by neuropsychological processes operating within three domains: (a) self‐referential processes involved in autobiographical reflection on past, and prospection about future, experiences; (b) executive functions, such as working memory, inhibition, and planning, that regulate the implementation of decisions; and (c) processes involved in value estimation and outcome appraisal and learning. These processes are underpinned by the interplay of multiple brain networks, especially medial and lateralized cortical components of the default mode network, dorsal corticostriatal circuits underpinning higher order cognitive and behavioral control, and ventral frontostriatal circuits, connecting to brain regions implicated in emotion processing, that control valuation and learning processes. Findings and conclusion Based on clinical insights and considering each of the decision‐making stages in turn, we outline disorder‐specific hypotheses about impaired decision making in four childhood disorders: attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), conduct disorder ( CD ), depression, and anxiety. We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD , it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk‐averse, and self‐deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder‐specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders. The final section highlights a number of important additional general themes that need to be considered in future research.",

      "abstract": "The concept of competence generally refers to the knowledge, experiences, skills, attitudes, abilities and behavior that enable effective action in a work environment. Since knowledge is linked to action, the part of an individual's knowledge used and put to work every day, mixed with the organization's knowledge, characterizes the competencies that allow a group of people to make complex tasks. The knowledge resides primarily in the heads of beings. Interactions between these persons allow to observe their knowledge through different media as documents, meetings, telephone conversations, or computer communication networks. Many works focusing on the analyse of mediated interactions to different purposes exist. So, we use these works to propose a methodology of identifying competence in professional mediated communications exchanges.",

      "title": "The psychological assessment of reading",
      "abstract": "Why do we need to assess literacy? Often because we, as professionals (either psychologists or specialist teachers), are called upon to do so. Usually it is because a child is experiencing (or is perceived by parents and/or teachers to be experiencing) some difficulties in learning to read, write or spell. We have to establish: (1) whether there really is a difficulty (not just an imagined problem); (2) the extent of the difficulty, should it exist; (3) the most likely cause, or causes, of the difficulty, and finally, (4) we are usually asked to recommend ways of putting things right. Causes are important, because they affect the recommendations one would make regarding appropriate help or support for the child. Many children with poor literacy skills are referred for assessment (whether privately or within the state system) on suspicion of dyslexia. Some are indeed found to have dyslexia, while others are often found to have been deprived of appropriate teaching (most commonly phonics tuition) or to lack the practice which is essential for basic literacy skills to become fluent. If the cause seems to be lack of appropriate teaching, simply recommending certain educational input may not be a sufficient remedy if the child's teacher does not have the appropriate skills or the child's school does not have the appropriate resources.",

      "title": "Employing the intellectual virtues to better understand argumentation interventions in education",
      "abstract": "Argumentation-based classroom interventions are a growing alternative for stimulating conceptual learning, thinking, and communicative skills. However, not all classroom argumentation is desired, nor does every argumentation design lead students to develop their abilities and understanding. In the educational literature, productive argumentation has been associated particularly with deliberation due to the design properties that deliberative practices demand from students, such as collaborating towards a goal, revising one’s own opinion, listening to others, and changing their minds when it is necessary to arrive at a collective decision or problem resolution. We contend that what makes deliberation productive is not argumentation in itself, but how a certain type of design scaffolds students into virtuous-like behavior, which can be the enabling condition for productive argumentation in classroom activities. Through the exploration of three cases of classroom argumentation and discussion experiences, we hypothesize that virtuous-like behavior may serve as an enabling condition for each intervention. In particular, intellectually humble behaviors could be scaffolded within these interventions because all three create the proper environment for students to revise their own positions, listen carefully to others, and change their minds in light of appropriate reasoning or new evidence. Employing an intellectual virtues framework, advances our understanding of how to design classroom environments for productive argumentation. This paper thus presents a novel and pioneering approach to understanding argumentation in the classroom by incorporating the concept of intellectual virtues, bridging the gap between virtues and traditional research, and offering fresh perspectives on the field.",

Self-esteem, self-efficacy and adjustment, make the person grow higher and higher and achieve success at the fastest rate. Most of the successful people do possess these abilities at high level, whereas weak and mostly unsuccessful lack these abilities in them. If one want to  improve and enhance one’s self-esteem, either a person have to develop of its own , or either gain through every day experiences or gain by undergoing training  for gaining life skills which may help to improve  and  enhance it. Every common man , students, professionals in day to day life come across situations/ and varied experience , in their personal and professional life , where they are unable to cope  with stress , emotions  especially anger, empathise , make decisions, solve problems, effectively communicate and listen , form strong interpersonal bonds, manage time . Due to lack of  these life skills  they are unable to  grow , prosper , achieve success  , which if they would have had would  have helped to improve and enhance their self-esteem, self-efficacy and adjustment and make them successful . Life skills for improving self-esteem, self-efficacy and adjustment include self-awareness, effective communication skills, interpersonal relationships, time management, coping stress, managing emotions, creative thinking, critical thinking, empathy and few others. These skills are very important skills essential for effective functioning of the life. There are many life skills, if developed by providing ‘life skill training’ can help the person to achieve success in his life. Researcher has designed a ‘training program’ especially for pre-service teacher trainees. Researcher have conducted a pilot study and have attempted to study effectiveness of  the life skill training of the developed ‘ training programme’  on self-esteem of teacher trainees at B.Ed. level , further performed  analysis to measure the effect of the developed ‘training program’ on self-esteem and  have presented the findings of the study conducted . The findings of the pilot study revealed that life skill training of ‘training programme’ developed by the researcher was effective on self-esteem of teacher trainees at B.Ed. level.",

      "abstract": "Technological advances and the way young people interact with them means children are thinking and processing information in an increasingly visual manner. Visualising Literacy and How to Teach It recognises that many, if not most, children are attracted to visual images and uses this as a basis for introducing and developing a range of thinking skills and strategies for learning. This practical resource offers a selection of visuals, each accompanied by activities that give children practice in using their imaginations in different ways. Visualising Literacy and How to Teach It not only explores creative and critical thinking skills but also pays close attention to the overarching thinking skill that we call imagination. The book contains around 150 practical activities that develop children's imaginations, focussing on a range of thinking skills, including but not limited to the following: developing observational/attentional skills noticing details (focussing of attention) assimilating visual information increasing experience of inferential thinking, speculation, dealing with generalisations boosting vocabulary empowering one's attitude towards exploring ideas learning different questioning techniques increasing the ability to empathise becoming comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity Many of the visualisation techniques can be applied to developing different aspects of emotional resourcefulness, including empathy, positive self-image, anchoring positive thoughts and modifying negative thoughts and feelings. This is, therefore, an essential resource for any teacher or education professional who is keen on developing children's ability to think and express their own ideas.",

      "abstract": "Because of psychological or physical impairments, older adults form a vulnerable group regarding\r\nresidential fire. This results in the fact that older adults are more often a victim of fire than other age\r\ngroups. Because older adults live independently longer, they are expected to prepare for residential fire\r\nthemselves. The research question is: ‘How self-reliant are older adults regarding residential fire and\r\nwhat influences the degree of self-reliance?’ Based on the Protection Motivation Theory and other\r\nliterature several factors are identified and analyzed that are possibly related with self-reliant behavior\r\nregarding residential fire. Via a survey, adults of 65 years and older are asked about their opinions and\r\ntheir actual behavior regarding fire prevention and preparation. Results indicate that the perception of\r\ntheir own abilities predict whether older adults take preventive measures and prepare for residential\r\nfire. Other results indicate that perceived knowledge, perceived response-efficacy and perceived selfefficacy\r\nare positively related to self-reliant behavior, which means that with a high perception of\r\nknowledge, response efficacy and self-efficacy, highly self-reliant behavior can be expected. There are\r\nseveral reasons why older adults might not prepare for fire, for example protective response costs,\r\nwhich are negatively related to self-reliant behavior. More research is needed to use these results for\r\neffective risk communication toward older adults. Future research could also focus on the influence of\r\nother factors, such as previous experiences with residential fire or the influence of family and friends.",

Four different kinds of category-learning tasks are currently popular-rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks, prototype distortion tasks, and the weather prediction task. The cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging results obtained using these four tasks are qualitatively different. Success in rule-based (explicit reasoning) tasks depends on frontal-striatal circuits and requires working memory and executive attention. Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback. Prototype distortion tasks induce perceptual (visual cortical) learning. A variety of different strategies can lead to success in the weather prediction task. Collectively, results from these four tasks provide strong evidence that human category learning is mediated by multiple, qualitatively distinct systems.",

      "title": "The Contribution of Pragmatic Skills to Cognition and Its Development",
      "abstract": "Abstract From both an evolutionary and a developmental perspective, sensorimotor skills precede “higher” cognitive abilities. According to traditional cognitive theories, abilities such as thinking, planning, and mindreading are not action-dependent. Action-based theories, however, do not view action and cognition as separate domains; they argue that pragmatic skills (or a “mastery of sensorimotor contingencies”) are integral components of higher cognitive abilities, essential for their development. For example, pragmatic skills might afford (active) perception, (active) learning, and the acquisition of conceptual knowledge as well as “intellectual” skills (e.g., thinking or calculating). Despite accumulating empirical support for action-based theories, it is unclear to which extent pragmatic skills contribute to cognition and its development, with contrasting proposals in the field. This chapter reviews three (not mutually exclusive) perspectives: (a) the coordinated self-organization of behavior and cognition; (b) the role of “cognitive mediators” across sensorimotor and higher cognitive domains; and (c) the action-based construction of abstract and amodal cognitive domains. Common perspectives and disagreements between these views are discussed and open issues, opportunities for theoretical debates, and empirical tests are highlighted, all of which might be contribute to a research agenda for the emerging “pragmatic” view of cognition.",

      "title": "Believing is seeing: how people's beliefs influence goals, emotions and behaviour",
      "abstract": "Introduction Health care professionals work and learn in complex environments. Some are able to continue learning from their practice and the challenges it presents, whereas others refrain from investing more effort when faced with setbacks. This paper discusses a social cognitive model of motivation that helps to explain the different kinds of behaviour that emerge when individuals are confronted with challenges. Self-theories Self-theories (people's theories on what competence is and means for the self) play a major role in establishing the goals people set for themselves, the emotions they experience and the meanings they attach to situations. These self-views are often not explicitly articulated and are therefore called 'implicit' ('self-') theories. Social cognitive research suggests there are two distinct ways of thinking about one's personal attributes: entity theorists view a trait as a fixed, concrete internal entity, whereas incremental theorists instead believe a trait to be something malleable that can be developed or cultivated through effort. Holding an entity theory leads one to set performance goals and to harbour concerns about performing well and making a good impression. Holding an incremental theory tends to lead one to set learning goals, and to focus less on performance and more on spending time and effort in determining which strategies work. Discussion The current literature on self-theories is used to explore the relevance of these theories in medical education in three contexts: (i) it is argued that, in order to support lifelong learning, both individual and organisational efforts fit best with an incremental outlook on professional development; (ii) if it is to move forward in the domain of feedback-seeking behaviour, medical education might benefit from a better understanding of the interactions among self-theories, feedback behaviour, and the pervading role of organisational culture, and (iii) the impact of self-theories on assessors' evaluations of performance.",

It can be implicitly felt through behavioral patterns or can be directly brought into play by way of verbal communication and removal of membership from an organization. No matter what kind of observed low relational evaluation takes place, this scenario still leads to depression, sadness, jealousy, isolation, envy, guilt, embarrassment, and anxiety. Emotions associated with this circumstance vary in terms of cognitive judgments, previous experiences, and consequential acts. In contrast, people who accept high regard exhibit delightful reactions and acquire an increased level of confidence and competence. The effects of either social approval or elimination are regulated when feelings are used to attain survival, reproduction, and adaptation. Although this chapter illustrates two sides of relational evaluation, much attention should be given to the further examination of positive interpersonal undertakings and outcomes, as well as to the understanding of resolutions to the negative social scenarios.",

This article aims to examine the concept of self-efficacy from Bandura's perspective, analyze its influence on individual performance, and present practical implications for the world of education and work. The results of the study show that individuals with high levels of self-efficacy tend to be more motivated, able to manage stress, and show better performance. Understanding the factors that shape self-efficacy, such as success experiences, modeling, verbal persuasion, and physiological conditions, is important for sustainable self-capacity development.",

      "abstract": "The power of psychologically based interventions has garnered much interest in the general public and in the social sciences, especially in social psychology. Among the lessons that such social-psychological interventions provide are two of special importance for educational practice and social policy. The first is that different students can perceive the same classroom differently and that these perceptions can lead to substantial differences in outcomes. The second is that timely and well-placed interventions, almost irrespective of their duration, can change students’ perceptions of school and the classroom for the better. Randomized double-blind experiments show that such change is possible and can trigger lasting improvements in students’ academic trajectories. In the context of closing achievement gaps, these insights offer practical solutions and a better understanding of motivation. This article focuses on how wise interventions and insights from social psychology can further apply to improve human affairs, both inside and outside the classroom.",

It functions as a multilevel and multifaceted set of beliefs that influence how people feel, think, motivate themselves, and behave. Self-efficacy beliefs are informed by enactive attainment, vicarious experience, imaginal experiences, social persuasion, as well as physical and emotional states. These beliefs are mediated by cognitive, motivational, affective, and selection processes to generate actual performance. Self-efficacy development is closely intertwined with a person's experiences, competencies, and developmental tasks in different domains at different life stages.

Without self-awareness, people could not take the perspectives of others, exercise self-control, produce creative accomplishments, or experience pride and high self-esteem. Research suggests that the positive and negative facets of self-awareness are reconciled when people have reasonable self-standards and when they are optimistic about meeting their standards.",

Simulation is suited to a constructivist approach as it is highly experiential, requiring mental and physical activity and affords the opportunity for reflection. SCT is primarily Albert Bandura's work and is congruent with constructivism. Two key concepts in SCT are ‘self-efficacy’ and ‘self-regulation’, both of which Bandura suggests are essential to learning. Situated learning theory reinforces the need for educators and learners to highlight and manage the ways in which the ‘real’ practice environment will vary from the simulated learning environment. Change of practice or learning can occur where there are serious contradictions within the activity system - in the example, the doctor may never provide advice and the practised division of labour may be in conflict with the actual rules.",

The broad cultural, social and professional environment, or 'macro-system', in which the person with an intellectual disability exists has many individual and interrelated components within multiple layers of complexity. Even taking the relatively straightforward context of a person with an intellectual disability who lives with his or her family, there are a range of systemic and professional issues with which the psychologist should be familiar and which must be taken into account in arriving at clinical decisions. This chapter will orientate the reader to some of these systemic variables and provide guidance on consultation and other models for working within complex systems, whilst maintaining the client or service user at the centre of the decision-making process.",

The assessment must consider the individual's physical deficits and strengths, cognitive status, sensory status, functional status, environment, the tasks the person performs or would like to participate in, caregivers, and others living in the person's environment. Common motor deficits resultant from neurologic conditions include impairments in balance, gait, gross and fine motor coordination, and unilateral weakness or paralysis.

To solve the problem, we review evidence suggesting that the human brain generates its concepts using a relatively limited set of rules and mechanisms. This suggests that it might be feasible to build AI systems that use similar criteria for generating their own concepts, and could thus learn similar concepts as humans do. Major challenges to this approach include the embodied nature of human thought, evolutionary vestiges in cognition, the social nature of concepts, and the need to compare conceptual representations between humans and AI systems.",

Researchers have long debated the role of individual differences in predicting precognitive performance, focusing on cognitive abilities, personality traits, and belief systems. While intelligence may contribute to the cognitive resources required to engage with precognitive tasks, evidence suggests it is not a decisive predictor. Personality traits, particularly openness to experience and extraversion, appear to influence susceptibility to anomalous perceptions, while belief in the paranormal consistently predicts enhanced performance in precognition tasks. This article synthesizes empirical studies on these psychological correlates, proposes an integrative model in which cognitive, dispositional, and attitudinal factors interact, and critically examines methodological challenges that have complicated the field.",

During the empirical study it has been established that along with a sensitive type (where all components of sensitivity appear at a high level), more often than others, students of psychological and pedagogical areas of training have an emotional-altruistic type, which indicates an insufficient development of interest in another and understanding a person, as well as an intuitive type that is associated with difficulties in understanding the inner world of another. In addition, an insensitive type often manifests itself, representatives of which demonstrate an insufficient level of formation of all components of sensitivity to humans. The results obtained can be used in organizing educational work at the university, as well as in the process of developing special programs to form sensitivity to another person among future teachers and psychologists.",

In any case of manifestation of stress, it affects all components of our individuality (individuality itself), such as memory, thinking, language, emotional and volitional sphere. However, this does not mean that stress is only evil, trouble, it is also the most important tool for training and hardening a person, since stress helps to increase the resistance of the psyche and the body in general, training its adaptive mechanisms. Stress is our faithful ally in continuous adaptation to any changes in the environment. For some students, student life is associated with student societies, communication with interesting people, various activities and fun. For others, it is a serious test, a life change, a difficult life situation to which it is necessary to adapt. Students are young and face various problems, new learning conditions require more independence, responsibility, self-organization, and not all students are ready to solve numerous problems and tasks. Which gives life. In any case, studying at a higher educational institution is stressful for many students. The student needs to overcome difficulties, master new roles and modify old ones, adapt to new life conditions.&#x0D; There is a lot of evidence that chronic stress is a companion of student life. Researchers note that the causes of stress in students are related to problems of finances, housing, security, etc. The stress experienced by students can affect learning (acquiring, applying, and processing knowledge), which hinders academic performance. Problems with academic performance also create discomfort, as a result of which general stress increases.",

Interventions are categories under the headings of explicit skills training, embodied/relational interventions, and relational approaches. The assessment and treatment of social neuropsychological impairments have received comparably less attention and development than other domains of cognition. These include difficulties in representing the intentions and perspectives of others (mentalising), recognising emotions, inferring nuanced social communications such as sarcasm and deceit, accessing social knowledge, and emotion-based decision-making. Founded on distributed neuroanatomical substrates, impairments of these functions have been found to be present and enduring across major sub-groups of acquired brain injury (for review see [1]). The theoretical richness of the social neuroscience revolution has not been matched by the translation of concepts and findings into rehabilitation practice. This article will review the embryonic field of social cognition rehabilitation, categorised into three intervention clusters: a) explicit skills training, b) embodied and affective interventions and c) relational approaches.",

      "abstract": "A theoretical analysis of the hardiness of higher education students in the conditions of modern realities was carried out. The priority vectors in modern science are singled out and the basic concepts of \"resilience\", \"resiliency\", \"hardiness\" are characterized. The peculiarities of the terminological apparatus of the research are clarified based on the research of scientific works of domestic and foreign authors. It defines \"resilience\" as the process of harmonious adaptation to adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress, such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or work or financial factors. It is noted that the definition of \"resiliency\" can be considered as the ability of the human psyche to revitalize after being in adverse life circumstances, recovery, acquisition of positive mental adaptation even after disasters, consolidation and recovery after complex traumatic events. It is proposed to define the term \"hardiness\" as the degree of formation of the ability to withstand a situation of acute or chronic stress to maintain internal balance without reducing the success of the activity. Sustainability is characterized as the foundation of a person's personal traits, one of the key properties of his individual ability to mature forms of self-regulation.It was found that resilience is manifested as a person's attitude towards himself, the surrounding world and the nature of interaction with it, it gives strength for self-actualization and self-realization, leadership, self-respect and self-acceptance, a healthy way of thinking and behavior, and makes it possible to feel significant and valuable enough to fully get involved in solving life tasks without being distracted by the presence of adverse factors and changes. Theoretical methods were used: analysis of philosophical, psychological-pedagogical, socio-pedagogical and sociological literature to outline the main theoretical principles of the researched problem; comparison and generalization for the systematization of scientific positions of domestic and foreign scientists; assessment of the resources of the innovative educational environment to determine the priority value orientations of those higher education students in the conditions of modern socialization challenges. The role of hardiness in building the trajectory of professional growth of higher education students in the conditions of modern realities is updated.",

Men endnu et aspekt kan gøre det nødvendigt at undersøge de studerendes ureflekterede motiver; menneskefagsstuderende indenfor fx psyko- logi, pædagogik, sociologi motiveres og drages ofte mod at undersøge faglige problemstillinger eller tematikker, som rummer aspekter af det, som de endnu ikke har forstået i deres eget liv. Dette er undringens baggrund, og den skaber et engagement, som er helt afgørende for, at studerende kan tilegne sig en faglig habitus. For at støtte de studerende i deres videnskabelige arbejde kan det dog blive nødvendigt som vejleder også at interessere sig for de studerendes motivation og faglige problemer ud fra et processuelt og psykologisk perspektiv. Dette kan opfattes som en overvågning af de studerendes adfærd og sproglige udtryk på et niveau, som er privat og ofte ukendt af personen selv. Denne praksis må derfor underkastes en kritisk undersøgelse og diskussion som led i at vise problemstillingerne, og hvordan de kan imødegås. Med disse forbehold argumenteres der for, at en selvrefleksiv opmærksomhed fra vejlederens side er et vigtigt uddannelsesgreb, når studerende skal tilegne sig et selvrefleksivt beredskab til at undersøge deres egen praksis. Selvrefleksion er nødvendig, hvis kandidaterne fra vores uddannelser skal rustes til at opretholde en professionalisme og videnskabelighed i forhold til de problemstillinger de arbejder med, efter uddannelsen.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;",

      "title": "Setting Impossible Standards: The Model of Ethical Decision-Making Associated with the New Zealand Psychologists' Code of Ethics",
      "abstract": "Ethical decisions are usually made with incomplete information, insufficient resources, and limited time. While some ethical decisions are about unusual and high-risk situations and draw on considerable resources, the majority are largely routine and these are often made with little or no explicit deliberation. The model of ethical decision-making offered with the recently published New Zealand Psychologists' Code of Ethics is like many other such models in that it demands cognitively explicit, linear, rational decision-making. This paper brings together literature from various sources to challenge this as the only view of how ethical decisions are made or how they should be made, and offers a range of solutions based on current psychological knowledge of how decisions, including ethical decisions, can be effectively made using both rational and non-rational explanations. ********** Decision-making in general has been a subject of research in psychology for many years and it has been found to be a complex process. Ethical decision-making has been less researched but, when it has been, it has been found to be highly complex and influenced by a range of internal factors, such as emotion and mood, and personal values, and it is also influenced by external factors such as interpersonal factors in the work place, organisational structure, and the ethical standards demonstrated by the employing company (Hollander, 1995; Singer, 1997; Singer, 1999; Trevino, 1986; Williams 2002). Many models of ethical decision-making have the goal of assured, optimal decisions but the reality is that such decisions are usually marked by complexity and uncertainty. Historically ethical decision making has been taught as a logical, linear and cognitively explicit process, typically based on methods from moral philosophy and classical decision theory. In the event of formal complaints or legal action, this same construct of the process of decision-making is used as the test to adjudicate on the quality of a practitioner's ethical behaviour. In such legalistic processes it is presumed that the practitioner had an explicit intent of which they were aware and which they had deliberated on for each action they have taken. A practitioner who cannot give an apparently deliberated and apparently a priori logical explanation will have trouble defending their actions. In what is a significant work on decision-making, Janis and Mann (1977 cited in Lipshitz, 2000, p757), prescribed the following as an outline of the ideal decision-making process: 1. Thoroughly canvass a wide range of courses of action; 2. Survey a full range of objectives and values; 3. Carefully weigh all known positive and negative consequences; 4. Search for new information intensively; 5. Re-examine all alternatives and considerations before making the decision; 6. Make detailed implementation plans, and prepare for potential contingencies. This style of thinking has been put forward for ethical decision-making by health professionals in a diverse range of literature, typical examples of which are shown in Table 1. Either implied, or explicitly stated, in these models is the goal of an optimal or 'best' decision being made. Simon (1991) illustrated the possible negative consequences of seeking the optimum when he wrote that searching for the best can only dissipate scarce cognitive resources; the best is the enemy of the good (p361). Beach and Lipshitz (1993) describe the historical origins of classical decision theories within utlitarian philosophy and Jeremy Bentham's philosphical model of the ideal 'Economic Man'. They suggest that, as a philosophical model, it had validity in the era in which it was developed as there was no attempt to attribute real world explanatory or predictive power to it. Such a frankly theoretical perspective allowed the 'Economic Man' to be both omniscient and 'computationally omnipotent'. …",

      "title": "[Can intuition in surgery by learned?].",
      "abstract": "Intuition, even at the end of the 20th century, has decisive significance in the field of medicine. Intuition within the medical field is understood to be a type of thinking based on experience, but without conscious recourse to its situations and thought processes; rather, it represents an act without reflection and one determining our medical actions to some extent. It is a cognitive process, an intuitive gain in recognition on the basis of experiential values called up from memory. Intuition is a combination of knowledge, ability, endurance, intellectual abilities, and discoursive methods of recognition, in short, the abilities of an expert. To become an expert, one must go through the stations of surgical training. In these the knowledge is imparted, which leads via decision-making to diagnosis and therapy. Intuition in the sense of the definition as experiential thinking cannot be learnt, but it can be schooled. The prerequisites for this are analytic thinking, expert knowledge, and metacognitive knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive development occurs throughout childhood, and it is marked by advances in perceptual abilities, short- and long-term memory, ability to focus attention selectively, and reasoning abilities. Such advances continue in adolescence, generally but also in specific ways, notably: metacognition (being able to think about your own thinking processes), abstract reasoning, and hypothesis testing (as in scientific reasoning). Following from this are the possibility of higher levels of moral reasoning; so-called adolescent egocentrism; and a quest for identity—reflecting on who you are and what you want to be. ‘Formal operational thought, moral development, and identity’ considers the three major theorists in these domains: Jean Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg, and Erik Erikson.",

      "abstract": "A variety of tasks was employed to train the child to use self-instructions to control his nonverbal behavior. The tasks varied along a dimension from simple sensorimotor abilities to more complex problem-solving abilities. The difficulty level of the training tasks was increased over the four training sessions requiring more cognitively demanding activities. One can imagine a similar training sequence in the learning of a new motor skill such as driving a car. Initially the driver actively goes through a mental checklist, sometimes aloud, which includes verbal rehearsal, self-guidance, and sometimes appropriate self-reinforcement, especially when driving a stick-shift car. Three different psychometric tests were used to assess changes in behavioral and cognitive impulsivity during the pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up periods. The impulsive child was exposed to a model which demonstrated the strategy to search for differences that would allow him successively to eliminate as incorrect all variants but one.",

      "title": "精神障礙者就業模式建構之國際比較研究-以台灣、美國、日本及德國為例",
      "abstract": "工作能提昇一個人的自尊，對一般人很重要，對精障個案更是重要，不能因病而喪失其工作權。同樣地，這也是人權的一部份，其實精障朋友經過積極治療，症狀穩定，康復之後仍有復健潛能，進入職場。當然，影響精障者社會/職業功能之因素，包括社會烙印、個案認知功能障礙，症狀干擾、人際關係與社會技巧，故較之其他障別而言，精障者之就業率低,且涵蓋就業安置及就業前職能評量與轉介等問題，更值得做進一步的研究分析,也更引人關注。但考慮完整之服務模式，包含就醫、就學、就業與就養之資源安排與分配，以就業一方面層次相當高，故更需階梯式之就業服務模式,由職能治療、活動治療、產業治療、工作訓練、職前訓練、職業復健、職業輔導評量、職業訓練，就業服務、職務再設計、訓用合一，甚至就業追蹤才能穩定持續就業，雇主與家庭支持網絡緊密結合,才能成功。\n從內政部資料顯示,慢性精神病患者已每年１０％以上之成長,佔身心障礙者人口數為９．２４％,但勞動力人口僅佔４．９％, 且其年齡分布在15歲至64歲之間的精障者，佔同年齡之身心障礙者(除了植物人與失智症)為14.29 %,而精障者中適合就業之年齡佔其92.44%,更凸顯精障者就業困境之嚴重性。\n而建構一個適宜且合乎時代潮流之精神障礙者,個案就業準備與安置,已是不可不重視的議題。本研究目的在於探討台灣、美國、日本、德國之精神障礙者就業模式之異同及那些國家政策可供本國參考,尤其針對身心障礙者權益保障與政策推動部份。參考其對精神障礙者就業模式之經驗,檢視本國現階段之就業服務型態與內容,提供一個延續性、完整性與本土化之就業模式。\n研究方法採文獻研究法(Archival Research),以較宏觀的角度收集,本研究選擇日本、美國及德國之觀點，因日本為我國社會文化相近的鄰近國家，福利體制與民情、文化相近；而美國推動殘障福利及身心障礙者就業體制，一直是本國在政策制訂上之追隨者，而美國的民間團體（NAMI）具有相當高的政策參與之影響力，家屬團結的力量可謂不小，是值得參考。而德國就業模式偏向於庇護工廠之經營及與企業間的結合，而社會福利政策相當鮮明，提供經費支援豐厚，由聯邦政府及地方政府共同合作，尚且其東、西德合併組成新政府，達成「融合」、「平等」之原則，值得學習。\n研究結果顯示:從歷史發展四個國家的發展都與醫療發展至社區相關;與種族、\n文化、社會、經濟息息相關;民間力量的參與是不可或缺的力量。從立法精神與相關法案得知這些法案之共通點：精障者均為後來才加入, 台灣法案均比其他國家起步為晚，但有急起直追之趨勢; 定額雇用比率較日本及德國低。在各種模式內容之成效評估,國內較缺乏實證研究,可能推動就業模式上,還須跨部會之整合,在主管機構與預算分配上,資源不均。\n綜合言之,擬訂國家精障者就業政策,建構本土化之就業模式與流程,來提升就業成功率及維持就業穩定性,且落實精障者之社會復歸,如此,不止可以嘉惠個案及家屬,更可以倡導請雇主在國家政策的鼓勵下,能真正停止排斥、勇於接納,以民間企業的力量,雇用症狀穩定,功能不錯的康復之友,提供適性之就業機會,整合國家與民間之資源,如此一來,更可以減少有些不須長期住院,給予出院準備服務及整體復健系統後,可以適合轉變為生產者之角色。",

We suggest that degree of context-dependency depends on cognitive control processes (attentional focus on focal or task-relevant information; inhibition of contextual or task-irrelevant information; task-management).

      "title": "Personal Intelligences",
      "abstract": "Historically, most intelligence theories include the personal intelligences that encompass apprehension of one's own experience, the ability to understand and manage people, and insight into the states of other people. Intrapersonal intelligence enables an individual to cultivate self-awareness, which operates during transitions at three progressive levels. Self-knowledge is produced by reflective thinking and is the basis for growth and development. The capacity for self-assessment follows and evaluates strengths and weaknesses during a transition. This supports self-development, which turns awareness into action. Interpersonal intelligence enables an individual to empathize with others, manage relationships in mutually beneficial ways, give and receive feedback, and build collaborative relationships that develop and ultimately lead others. The personal intelligences are investigated through retrospective interviews with twenty-four elite performers in three domains (business, sports, and music) who successfully and repeatedly transitioned to higher positions within their field.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning, problem solving, and decision-making represent different but overlapping aspects of human intelligence. The researchers following the cognitive psychological approach to the study of reasoning study the responses of a small number of participants to logical tasks such as syllogisms or formal logic tasks. The theories dominating psychological theorizing about reasoning are: mental rules and mental models. Both theories were first applied to the study of deductive reasoning tasks such as syllogisms and then applied to a broader range of reasoning tasks. Human reasoning occurs at different levels of awareness. Most cognitive scientists distinguish between tacit and intentional (or explicit) reasoning processes. One of the important controversies about reasoning abilities is the extent to which individual differences in reasoning abilities overlap with individual differences in working memory capacity. Traditionally, tests such as the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) or the SAT have been used to provide a measure of cognitive development.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes the professional reflection in the structure of professional competence, as a result of the training of future psychologists, that includes the readiness of the psychologists to evaluate and self-assess professional activity and the results obtained, to make timely adjustments to professional activities, to carry out analysis and forecasts. It is determined that in the professional activity of the psychologist’s intellectual, cooperative, social-perceptual, personal and communicative types of reflection are presented. Reflection carries out design, organizational, communicative, semantic, motivational, corrective functions. Reflexive skills that are characterized by generalization, possessing the property of transfer, and promote the development of other types of skills, provide self-regulation activities and interaction, self-improvement and self-development of the psychologist’s personality. In the process of reflection the self-knowledge, self-development and self-regulation of personality are provided. Reflection involves self-control, consciousness of action. The professional reflection of a qualified specialist in the field of practical psychology is multidirectional, coregent and multi-level, is considered as an ability that ensures the formation of the skill of systematic analysis with further creative activation of one’s professional activity and therefore requires purposeful formation. In the concept of professional development of the psychologists, reflection is seen as a means of solving intrapersonal contradictions, the cause of which is inconsistency between “I-real”, “I-ideal” and “I-reflexive”. The result of personal reflection is the “image of me” of the psychologist as a generalized system of representations of the subject about itself, formed as a result of the processes of awareness of itself in three complementary systems: in the system of professional activity, in the system of professional communication and in the system of personal development. The systematic exercise of reflexive activity by the psychologist helps to establish its professional competence. That is why future psychologists need the formation of professional reflection of already while studying in a higher educational institution, in order to develop and improve them during their professional activities.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a triarchic theory of human intelligence, according to which intelligence comprises three aspects : analytical ability, creative-synthetic ability, and practical ability. People strong in analytical ability do well in traditional schooling and testing, although they are not necessarily the best equipped for the tasks of life after schooling ends. People strong in creative ability do not necessarily do well in school, and sometimes are regarded by teachers as uncooperative. These same problems can plague them in later life if they are in environments that demand conformity. People strong in practical ability adapt well to the demands of life, although they may not be the best students in traditional schools. Ideally, a person balances some of each of these abilities in order to meet the various challenges of the environment. According to the theory, intelligence is therefore multifaceted. Intelligence involves purposive adaptation to, shaping of, and selection of real-world environments, and is best expressed when a person knows his or her strengths and weaknesses, and capitalizes on the strengths at the same time he or she compensates for or remediates weaknesses.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of human thoughts, feelings, and the associated processes, including learning. In the past 50 years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding how people learn. These principles can be used to make theological education more effective in the majority world. Missionaries and other educators can make theological education more effective by being familiar with the concepts of automatic and effortful processing, the spacing effect, and the testing effect. Since the use of technology is rapidly evolving in many parts of the world, cognitive science also provides insights into some of the educational pitfalls associated with technology. Technology-based distraction in the classroom prevents effortful processing from occurring. Outside of the classroom, technology may make time-management more difficult, leading to poor study habits. An inappropriate use of multimedia in the classroom may impede learning rather than enhance it. Increasing use of technology in the majority world is often accompanied by economic growth which may also impact theological education. Although incredible diversity exists among humans, there is sufficient similarity in human minds across cultures to scientifically study how a person’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior influence each other. Cognitive science is the broad, interdisciplinary field that examines the psychological and biological phenomena associated with the mind. Because the human mind is so complex, progress in the field is often painstakingly slow, especially when compared to the progress that has been made in the physical sciences. Although we can predict with a good deal of accuracy what a molecule or a nearby star will do in a year or in a century from now, we have a very difficult time predicting what our next-door neighbor will do tomorrow. Nevertheless, cognitive science has enabled us to discover general trends that describe how humans are likely to behave in various circumstances, although we will never be able to predict exactly how a specific individual would act in those circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Finding answers to the questions pertaining to life such as making predictions, taking decisions and solving problems require mental / intellectual activities. The mental activities displayed by an individual e.g to think, to perceive, to comprehend, to recognize the changes in the conditions of the environment and to adjust to them, to overcome instant issues, to regulate and to structure the conditions which the psychological science conceptualize as cognition, are called cognitive flexibility. Before and after getting a job, individuals form a certain cognitive process in their minds related to the job’s requirements and the responsibilities which are normally not accounted for by the formal, legalistic employment contract. Such perceptional contracts which affect the work life are called Psychological Contracts. Review of the literature has shown that no such research was directed towards the relation between the Cognitive Flexibility Level and the Psychological Contract of the employees as of date. The present paper aims the research of Cognitive Flexibility Level of the public servants in terms of their Psychological Contract Roles The research was carried out at the Bakirkoy Courthouse under the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice with the participation of 299 public servants comprising chief clerks, court clerks, janitors, court criers, debt enforcement clerks employed at courts, prosecution offices and debt enforcement offices between 2016 and 2017. In order to measure the Cognitive Flexibility levels, The Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) developed by Dennis JP and Vander Wal JS (2010) which was adapted to Turkish by Volkan Gulum and Ihsan Dag (2012) under the title Bilissel Esneklik Envanteri (BEE) has been used as the Dependent Variable.. And for measuring the roles of psychological contracts, the Psychological Contract developed by Millward, L.J. & Hopkins, L.J. (1998), the reliability and the validity of which was made by N. Oyku Iyigun and Canan Cetin (2012) was used as the Independent Variable of the research. The demographical data of the public servants were generated by the researcher with the use of Personal Data Questionnaire. Furthermore regression technique and Mann Whitney, Kruskal Wallis tests and Spearman correlation tests were drawn upon for the analysis of the research. Findings have shown that, the Psychological Contract Roles of the public servants have positive impact on their Cognitive Flexibility levels. Findings have also shown that the public servants who have participated in the research can display high alternative solutions perception skills which enable them to solve the problems which may arise in the organization. Furthermore it has appeared that the participants’ Relational Contract perception level which is a sub dimension of Psychological Contract, is higher than those of Job Dissatisfaction and Transactional Contract.. Consequently, it can be said that the public servants do care about the organization they work for and the people they are in contact with.",

A multi-factor account is presented in which neuropsychological disability on any occasion is attributed to some combination of neuropsychological deficits plus one or more of four personal factors (negative thinking, tension-arousal, fatigue, physical symptoms) and three situational factors (demands for complex attention, demands for rapid processing, external distractions). Citing pertinent research the paper discusses the development of, and possible mechanisms of influence by, these seven factors. It then broadly prescribes clinical interventions that might assist clients to reduce their adverse effects. It is suggested that the scope of brain injury rehabilitation be extended to include training clients to identify and manage non-organic conditions that may combine with direct brain injury effects to compromise productive work, complicate social relationships, or render the affected person less able to cope with stress.",

      "abstract": "Health is complex, multidimensional and hard to define. Health is a separate concept from health status since health is dynamic and health status suggests the ability to measure. Some of the dimensions of health appear in definitions and literature. The inability to define health may lead to some problems in measuring health status as a statistical variable, a perspective that underlines the importance of a clear definition, as complete as possible, appropriate to the context for which the analysis is made. Current definitions do not address all dimensions of health. More broad definitions that capture more dimensions of health are essential to support health policy decision-making and researchers. Several analyses use some variables related to dimensions of health (e.g. extracted from WHO definition - social, mental and physical). A clearer definition makes it easier monitor and meet the objectives. In this study, the health and health status are defined first, and then some dimensions from definitions of health and from literature are debated. The results consist in this collection of dimensions: physical, mental, social, functional, subjective, religious, environmental, emotional, intellectual. Definition created is as follows: \"Health is a complex, multidimensional concept that can be affected by a multitude of factors such as physical, social, mental, religious, intellectual, subjective, environmental, and broadly it links to the idea of pain or suffering in any way, but also the well-being and happiness, i.e. holiness for those who have it.\". It is important to have a complex definition to support health policy decision-making, which leads towards improving the health status of the population.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the lived experiences of misjudgment by sports umpires from a phenomenological perspective, and to investigate the structure and meaning of failure learning experiences encountered by adults in their everyday lives. Data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 12 umpires and referees and analyzed using Giorgi’s phenomenological approach. The findings revealed that the experiences of failure learning were categorized into 5 main components, 20 sub-components, and 74 meaning units. The components of failure learning-failure learning triggers, failure learning activities, failure learning strategies, failure learning outcomes, and the dissemination of failure learning-along with their sub-components, were mapped out in a structural diagram to illustrate the framework of umpires' failure learning experiences. A key feature of failure learning is the utilization of various emotion regulation strategies, including physical concentration, motivational shifts, cognitive interpretation, emotional acceptance, and emotional refreshing, to confront, resolve, or transform negative emotions into positive ones. The outcomes of failure learning not only enhance professional performance and expand positive emotions, leading to personal growth, but also have a broader impact on the community. This study emphasizes the value of learning through failure that adults experience in the workplace, reaffirming its importance in lifelong learning.",

      "title": "Introducing Actor–Network Theory via the Engineering Sophomore Year",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introducing Actor-Network Theory Via the Engineering Sophomore YearMotivation & Background:Research in engineering education typically requires identifying a unit of analysis, drawing aboundary to define and separate a system under study from other systems of lesser interest. Forexample, assessments of course interventions or extracurricular programs are inherentlybounded, as analyses necessarily focus on the efficacy of the specific approach beingimplemented. Similarly, studies have isolated individual cognitive factors like engagement,confidence, and belonging to facilitate the measurement and reporting of results as well asnarrow the scope for targeted interventions.In contrast, consider what happens if no system boundary is drawn, if no unit of analysis isidentified at the outset of an educational study. Instead of purposely isolating a set of factors oran individual course, what if these items are analyzed in terms of how they connect to others, tounderstand patterns of linkages and the resulting networks? Moving from isolation to connectionin educational research is one means of examining the social complexity of our everyday lives, tounearth the elements that are not accounted for when looking at the impact of a singleintervention on a designated class or program. This provides for a nuanced, exploratory study ofthe individually, socially, and culturally complex intersecting phenomena which constituteengineering education and its adherents. We initiate a new paradigm in engineering education,departing from the intervention-assessment model to conduct innovative research investigatingsociocultural relationships across environments, events, and effects on students.Actor-Network Theory, a novel social theory originating from the field of Science andTechnology Studies, advocates precisely this connected view of sociocultural phenomena, andthis approach of tracing out connections made between different types of elements: people,things, courses, cognitive constructs, and more. We adopt this conceptual framework toinvestigate the core engineering sophomore year – not in isolation, but in connection with theelements that flow in, out, and around this transitional time in engineering education. While theheavily-studied first or freshman year is characterized by the transition from high school tocollege environments, the understudied second year remains a pivotal time as passing or failinggrades determine which disciplinary networks, or majors, students come to call their own. Thesecond year features gateway courses that eventually lead to the practice of engineering, coursesthat initiate students into greater levels of abstraction and analytical engineering problem solvinglike Calculus 3 and Differential Equations. These two courses, chosen as initial sites for ournetwork study, also serve as prerequisite requirements for subsequent technical courses inengineering degree programs. In the language of Actor-Network Theory (ANT), we wish to askhow students become enrolled in the actor-networks of engineering sophomore year and to whatconsequence.Methodology (including Assessment Methods)We utilize an ethnographic method of qualitative data collection. A slogan of ANT is to “followthe actors themselves” as they establish varied and dynamic connections in the social terrainbeing investigated. An actor can be human or non-human, as objects like curricula and textbookscan be connected as meaningfully to other elements in a network as a student to an instructor.Following the heterogeneous actors in this sense means tracing the associations made betweenall actors and artifacts in a given system, adding new elements as new connections are made andletting go of elements whose connections fade. By starting with the students, teachers, andartifacts involved in sophomore-level required mathematics courses, we have a foundational setof elements from which to expand the network and analyze which conditions are conducive tonetwork formation vs. dissolution. We record observations of course events both official andinformal; conduct semi-structured interviews with human actors that can speak for themselves;and gather artifacts and documentation that assist in tracing the connections made by non-humanobjects. This method is intended to trace out connections and map student actor-networks in theuniversity setting.Research/Assessment ResultsIn addition to introducing Actor-Network Theory and its applications to engineering education,this paper will present sample data from our study – a glimpse of salient actor-networks insophomore engineering. As an example: consider the actor-network of a mathematics lecture,including the students present on a given day, the content being presented, the instructor doingthe presenting, the notebooks students take notes in (or not), and the devices students use duringa lecture period to keep themselves entertained: pencils, crossword puzzles, and the new, moderndistraction of Internet-enabled Smartphones. Tracing out these activities during a contemporarymath lecture includes not just the public questions and answers voiced by students and teachers,but also the quieter online actions of students on their phones. As students text their friends orutilize social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, they are accessing alternateactor-networks as resources. We further analyze the consequences of accessing these onlineactor-networks in comparison to participating with the institutionally sanctioned actor-networkenacted by the lecturer at the chalkboard. Listening to students explain why they prefer to readtheir phones and text friends instead of paying attention and asking questions in lecture is aprocess of following the actors and realizing which actor-networks students utilize moreprominently than others. By pursuing student words and explanations to trace connections toadditional actors in the network, we begin to see how these dynamic actor-networks flowthrough the space and time of engineering sophomore year, ultimately rendering acomprehensive description of these lesser known happenings in engineering education.Conclusions & SignificanceActor-Network Theory offers a unique way of conceptualizing the social environment duringcritical phases of undergraduate engineering. Looking at sophomore engineering from an actor-network perspective illuminates connections between objects/constructs and people that may beintentional or unintentional, chained to consequences like retention in engineering or thedevelopment of some skills at the expense of others. We utilize the ANT approach to look atsocial interactions and complexity that cannot be accounted for with an analysis of isolatedfactors. Moving from studying isolated interventions to heterogeneous connections in sophomoreengineering gives us a lens through which we can investigate how new technologies (includingnonstop online connectivity) are changing the organization of space and time for our studentsand their networks. Simultaneously, we search for cracks in ossified educational practices thathave endured unexamined for “years and years.” Taken as a whole, we seek to uncover theconsequences of different actor-network formation and dissolution on the trajectories ofsophomore engineers and provide informed recommendations for educating engineers.",

Since its rapid evolution in the 1960s, cognitive psychology has sought to improve scientific understanding of the fundamental properties of the human information processing mechanism. Its primary emphases have been upon developing and testing theories concerning the ways in which that mechanism constructs, manipulates, and acts upon mental representations. Individual theories cover perception, language understanding and production, memory, problem solving, consciousness, intention and the control of action and many more. These areas of concern are all potentially relevant to the ways in which users will behave in the course of interacting with a computer. Applied cognitive psychology attempts to bridge the gap between the properties of cognition as studied in the more abstract laboratory tasks and those phenomena that are characteristic of cognition in the tasks of everyday life.",

      "title": "EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE - A POSSIBLE PREDICTOR OF PERFORMANCE OR SUCCESS AT ORGANIZATIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL?!",
      "abstract": "Considered in the past as being solely a rational being, nowadays, following specialist researches, man is also perceived as an emotional being, triggering emotions which, if appropriately educated, allow us to obtain countless benefits, both professionally, and personally. Thus, the concept of emotional intelligence redefines the image about man and about the world. At organizational level, performance achievement depends both on the manager’s or team success, and on the success of every individual employee, such success being influenced by how the members relate and interact with each other. Furthermore, an important role is played by the team vision on performance and on achieving it, this being based on psychological and social factors making their reaching their goals easier or harder, since such factors are related to the emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence cannot be, by itself, a predictor of career success, satisfactory career or effective leadership. It is only one of several important components. It increases the chances of success, however it does not guarantee success in the absence or required knowledge. Some studies describe the role emotional intelligence plays in career planning, and even analyse the levels of emotional intelligence required for every single stage in someone’s career. In time, within organizations, a new type of management has slowly, but surely, outlined itself, namely, the emotional intelligence management. This paper aims at approaching this topic both theoretically, and practically, through applications. The micro-research was performed in a Romanian private company, the subjects interviewed in parallel being both Department Managers (the tool being the EQ test), and their subordinates (the tool being the questionnaire), and it aims at identifying a correlation between the Manager’s EQ level and the organizational climate of the subordinated team.",

Three ways cognitive psychology can apply to the study of performance discrepancies are discussed. These applications include (a) explaining the variance in test performance, (b) focusing on competence, and (c) revealing processing discrepancies when the overt preformances of LD and nonlearning disabled (NLD) children are similar. The article concludes that current approaches to understanding performance discrepancies are insensitive to how LD children represent and access knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The paramedic role requires countless sound, logical and sensible decisions to be made. Sometimes paramedics may be faced with decisions that they feel less confident about making. This paper will discuss the types of clinical decision-making approaches. The majority of everyday decisions are made intuitively. The brain uses its experience to match decisions that it has made, observed or contributed. This may not be a reliable method of decision making, especially if you have been unable to gather sufficient information. Pattern recognition is a skill-based activity. Unlike intuition, which can support near-instant decision making, it is done when time permits and there is no need to rush. Under the hypothetico-deductive model of clinical decision making, the clinician sorts the clues and findings into logical groups using previous knowledge of symptoms and anatomical locations and landmarks. Then a hypothesis is formulated based on experience and knowledge of pathological, physiological and psychological conditions. Generally, clinicians need to improve their awareness of clinical decision making: using intuition might well have a role to play coupled with heuristics and bias, but it has its limitations and risks. However, hypothetico-deductive reasoning has a prominent place and should be embedded into education and everyday use.",

Social workers are people who work with people. Most social workers will be uncomfortable with the term ‘abnormal’ psychology and may prefer to use the operational term ‘clinical’ psychology. Psychology has developed five main theoretical approaches to the study of behaviour: biological, behaviourist, cognitive, psychodynamic and humanist. Social psychology can help provide insight into these questions that relate to the underlying factors impinging upon the process of social work. Much clinical psychology is underpinned by advances in drug treatments for mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. The behaviourist approach is based upon the assumption that behaviour is learnt and shaped as a result of environmental circumstances. This approach attempts to explain behaviour by studying observable responses rather than by looking for internal processes.",

Individual differences in self-control have been found to be stable over time, and to be correlated with measures of success and social adjustment. Research on self-control conducted by developmental psychologists can be integrated in an evolutionary framework. The ability to exert self-control pays off biologically by enabling animals to delay gratification and to constrain selfish urges such as those that define the Seven Deadly Sins (gluttony, avarice, sloth, pride, wrath, envy, and lust).",

      "title": "Building on Diversity: A Moment-to-Moment Analysis of Students Collaboratively Solving Mathematics Problems.",
      "abstract": "Differences among students can yield rich benefits as well as pose difficult problems during collaborative learning. Students can draw on diverse individual experiences to exchange information, to understand different expressions of shared commonalities, and to construct new possibilities jointly. However, they also face the potential pitfalls of entrenching themselves in opposition to different views, dismissing other perspectives as less important or valid, and misinterpreting others. To examine how individual actions create these benefits and problems, a three-dimensional space is defined, created from the dimensions of evaluation of the previous action (supportive, critical, or unresponsive), problem knowledge content (contribution, repetition, and null), and interactive form (command, question, and statement). Analysis of particular patterns of individual actions indicates how they create beneficial or harmful interactions. Three examples of conversations taking place during collaborative problem solving in an algebra class show how particular individual actions can facilitate or hinder students' collaborative learning. Educators can use a framework developed through this analysis as a collaboration and assessment tool to help students benefit from their individual experiences.

      "abstract": "Mathematical problem solving is a process involving metacognitive (e.g., judging progress), cognitive (e.g., working memory), and affective (e.g., math anxiety) factors. Recent research encourages researchers who study math cognition to consider the role that the interaction between metacognition and math anxiety plays in mathematical problem solving. Problem solvers can make many metacognitive judgments during a math problem, ranging from global judgments such as, \"Do I care to solve this problem?\" to minor cue-based judgments such as, \"Is my current strategy successful in making progress toward the correct solution?\" Metacognitive monitoring can hinder accurate mathematical problem solving when the monitoring is task-irrelevant; however, task-relevant metacognitive experiences can lead to helpful control decisions in mathematical problem solving such as checking work, considering plausibility of an answer, and considering alternate strategies. Worry and negative thoughts (i.e., math anxiety) can both interfere with the accuracy of metacognitive experiences as cues in mathematical problem solving and lead to avoidance of metacognitive control decisions that could otherwise improve performance. The current paper briefly reviews and incorporates prior literature with current qualitative reports (n = 673) to establish a novel framework of regulated attention in mathematical problem solving (RAMPS).",

We propose that accountability to others for fulfilling relational responsibilities facilitates flourishing mental health. Conversely, difficulties in appropriately responding to others with answerability or impairments in self-regulation to carry out relational commitments pose challenges for flourishing. We begin by considering the personality, neurobiological, and developmental aspects of accountability. We then consider the importance of the virtue for clinical practice, professionalism, and growth. Flourishing is likely to emerge not only when people become more autonomous, but also when they develop the capacity of accountability—to seek out and respond well to feedback in order to fulfill responsibilities in relationships.",

Social-cognitive theories dominate the field and have provided many insights, but have been criticised for relying on a traditional methodological base and lacking contextualisation and embeddedness in individual experience. In the current 'learning age', sustaining motivation for (often formal/academic) learning across the life span is increasingly expected, but understanding the persistence of such learning across life is not well understood. Much of the work on motivation for learning is quantitative, employing questionnaires, brief interviews or experimental manipulations. Longitudinal, qualitative research is sparse, though a necessary counterpoint that can provide contextualised and alternative accounts of motivation through time and across culture. This paper presents a case study applying self-efficacy research, the lifespan theory of control and transitions theory to an individual's learning trajectory.",

Their frequency, typical for the modern world, carries threats to life and personal dangers. The negative thing is that emergency situations occur suddenly and at night, are accompanied by disruption of communications, and in cases of natural disasters, a sharp deterioration in weather conditions occurs. It has been proven that 12-15% of persons in emergency situations retain self-control, the ability to rationally assess the situation, to act clearly and decisively even in the most difficult conditions. The basis for this is the level of psychological protection that is formed in everyday activities. The reaction (passive, active) of people to emergencies is revealed. In some, the sense of danger turns into feelings of doom and inevitability, they become completely helpless, confused, incapable of purposeful actions (for example, to protect). Others – under the influence of a threatening situation, they feel the rise of spiritual and physical strength, they can begin to act more persistently and tirelessly. In some people, the instinct of self-preservation causes a desire to escape, to avoid threatening circumstances, in others it mobilizes and tunes in to active actions. Speaking about assessing the negative impact of certain adverse factors that arise during emergencies, one should distinguish between normal and pathological reactions of people. In the first case, the psychological clarity of the reaction becomes important, its occurrence, as a result of an emergency, and mainly a short duration. The working capacity of a person is preserved (albeit reduced), there is contact with people around him, and a critical assessment of his actions remains. Six stages of behavior of people caught in an emergency situation are identified, the behavior of each stage is characterized. Under the influence of stress factors, there is a risk of pathological changes in the structure of the personality, which are the basis for the development of personal disharmony. To reveal individual and collective methods of protecting people in emergency situations (a person's desire to go beyond the influence of harmful factors (to avoid danger, to protect himself, etc.). Panic was revealed as the most dangerous and negative factor caused by real or perceived danger, which may involve one or more people.",

It is based on the allocation of families of psychological properties of independent volitional qualities. In total, seven such families are distinguished. These include: the family of endurance, initiative, organization, perseverance, decisiveness, independence and courage. Each of them consists of 5 elements that are necessary and sufficient to build a metric scale for assessing the strength of manifestation of independent volitional qualities of a person. There is a test-questionnaire designed to measure the strength of each volitional quality in adolescence, including: content, instruction, keys, and an example of calculating a number of indicators. The psychometric substantiation of the diagnostic tool based on the description of content validity, as well as on the calculation of prognostic validity, retest and one-time reliability is carried out.",

Computational models of cognitive development are formal systems that track the changes in information processing taking place as a behavior is acquired. Models are generally implemented as psychologically constrained computer simulations that learn tasks such as reasoning, categorization, and language. Their principal use is as tools for exploring mechanisms of transition (development) from one level of competence to the next during the course of cognitive development. They have been used to probe questions such as the extent of 'pre-programmed' or innate knowledge that exists in the infant mind, and how the sophistication of reasoning can increase with age and experience",

Caring is “presence”: according to Heidegger, it is “being-in-the-world-with-the-others”. Caring endows situations experienced in healthcare contexts with unique qualities, e.g. when we accompany the dying, or when we allow people who live in existential distress to experiment different opportunities to be themselves. Being a caring presence “is at issue for it”: the practitionerslive an inextricable and problematic intertwining between personal and professional dimensions. The article questions how to support this presence from a pedagogical point of view. Self-care, understood as an educational, professional and self-learning practice, could be considered as an answer that allows us to go beyond the individual empowerment. Indeed, self-caring could be an essential condition to take care of the whole existential experience in the healthcare contexts.

      "title": "8.6 Ergonomics and public health",
      "abstract": "Abstract Ergonomics is the application of scientific knowledge about human physical and psychological capacities and limitations to the design of products, systems, and environments for comfort, safety, and ease of use. Ergonomic principles can—and should—be applied to the workplace, transportation vehicles and throughways, consumer products, and complex systems ranging from healthcare delivery to nuclear power plants to international aviation. Tools and other items for use at work and at home should be designed to fit the full range of the population in body size, strength, and aerobic capacity. Task and system design should further take account of human requirements in sensory perception (vision, hearing, and touch), cognition and memory, and psychosocial environment. All human characteristics display variability from person to person that is only partly explained by gender, age, ethnicity, and training or experience. Occupational ergonomics receives special attention in many countries because of the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, such as back pain and tendonitis, associated with job demands such as heavy lifting, repetitive motions, and vibration exposure. Work stations, equipment (operating controls and display devices), and tools can accommodate the human body so that they are easy to use without error, fatigue, or injury. Jobs that permit variations in motion patterns and work routines, offer sufficient rest and recovery, encourage learning and using new skills, and facilitate rather than impede positive interactions among co-workers will promote both physical and mental health. The physical environment should be optimized in terms of temperature, lighting, and background noise to achieve workplace safety, optimized physiological endurance, and mental concentration. Work schedules other than a standard 40-h, 5-day work week are increasingly common in the global 24/7 economy. The health consequences include sleep disruption, digestive disorders, loss of mental concentration and risk of injury, and elevated risk of obesity and heart disease. Flexibility in selecting one’s own work schedule mitigates some of these hazards, but overtime work is often not voluntary and economic competition pressures many professionals to maintain electronic communication with the workplace even during supposed leisure time. In fact, productivity suffers when individuals do not have sufficient recovery time; more broadly, the application of ergonomics principles to the workplace often—but not always—improves efficiency and reduces costs, both directly and as a result of improved employee health. Developing countries tend to have fewer resources for occupational health and safety in general, including for risk analysis, standard-setting, and enforcement. However, ergonomics measures are not always expensive and can promote both worker protection and enhanced productivity and sustainability of the national enterprise.",

The process of coping describes the emotional, cognitive, biological, and behavioral efforts that an individual exerts to manage their stress. Stress is often categorized by timescale (i.e., acute stressors, daily hassles, life events, or chronic stressors), whereas coping strategies are often distinguished as emotion- vs. problem-focused or, more recently, approach- vs. avoidant-focused. A wealth of measures captures the various conceptualizations of stress and coping (e.g., the Brief COPE). Several theories describe stress and coping, most prominently the transactional theory and the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. Stress and one's ability or inability to effectively cope with stress can lead to problems with sleep, physical health, and mental health, although some people show resilience and post-traumatic growth following stressful events. Notable areas for continued research include continued innovation of creative yet valid measurement techniques and the assimilation of the stress and coping literature with similar concepts such emotion regulation.",

It is suggested that these narratives may be seen as attributing failure to either the occurrence of particular events, or to the deliberate actions of specific groups or individuals. These are characterized as narratives of inevitability and conspiracy. Some possible reasons for the promotion of these alternative narratives are discussed.",

In interpreting these comments and accounts, the authors posit a gap between many psychologists' contemplation of their work and their actual research practices. The authors also suggest that such a gap may be related to psychologists' educational experiences and their scholarly and professional socialization, as well as to their subdisciplinary attachments and contexts.",

      "title": "Enabling a motivated workforce: exploring the sources of motivation",
      "abstract": "Purpose This paper recognizes self determination theory (SDT) as a model to successfully motivate an organization's workforce and recommends SDT as a more encompassing theory of motivation. Consequently, motivation assumes a different dimension and it therefore becomes necessary to consider issues associated with autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and motivation as a predictor of performance. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach The paper initially identifies the underlying assumptions of motivation that include: people having the capacity for responsible actions, a natural aspiration to learning and understanding things, and the desire to do good at work and play. The paper then proceeds to addresses several basic issues associated with SDT, namely, cognitive, affective and psycho‐motor development. Finally, it considers perception of the self, one's psychological and emotional needs, life goals and aspirations, individual dynamism, culture and the impact of social environments as key issues that determine one's ability to self‐actualize. Findings The study shows SDT's relevance to discussions in organizational behavior. The findings suggest that extrinsic motivation can be deleterious to intrinsic motivation. Work‐related happiness is acquired when individuals use their personality as a motivation determinant to fulfill a mission that is meaningful to themselves too. Individuals are most resourceful and innovative when they feel motivated largely as a result of their interest, their inner satisfaction, and challenges of the work itself and not by external pressures or incentives. Practical implications In this regard it is recommended that human resources professionals and/or managers need to consider issues associated with autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and motivation as a predictor of performance. Different attitudinal relationships towards work‐play necessitate distinct types of motivation. Should work and play become homogeneous, the defining role of human resources management in relation to motivation needs revisiting in particular SDT Originality/value This paper adds to the academic literature on motivation in a somewhat different vein by presenting autonomy, competence, and relatedness in SDT as vitally essential for psychological growth, optimal functioning, and well‐being in any fields of endeavor. The study identifies extrinsic rewards as undermining intrinsic motivation in most circumstances.",

This study aims to present definitions to allow academics to establish a point of reference when designing accounting curricula to encompass such skills. Design/methodology/approach The skill classification of explicit curriculum content is straightforward, and is undertaken by using content analysis to record objectives and/or tasks that are clearly stated in the curriculum documents. The classification of implicit skills was developed by setting, as clearly as possible, internal criteria that are used to determine whether a task embodied a particular behavioural skill. Findings The results show that not all 22 personal and interpersonal skills which should be developed during an accounting degree, according to the Australian professional accounting bodies, are in fact developed. The higher order and difficult skills of: think creatively and innovatively; handle conflict; handle challenges; handle change and empathy are not present in either the explicit or implicit curricula. Originality/value Concepts and understandings of many of the behavioural skills are abstract and a range of interpretations exists. Although the definition of each skill presented in this study is not as extensive or exhaustive as a lexicographer's compilation, this study is unique in that it offers clearer and more acceptable definitions for accounting educators to use than has previously been available.",

The onset of physical disability occurs due to trauma or disease, either of which can mean a reduction in function (e.g., activities of daily living) or the literal loss of a body part (e.g., limb amputation). Restricted mobility, activity, or physical loss can have psychological consequences, so that some individuals report a variety of depressive symptoms and problem behaviors following disability onset. Yet many people with disabilities do not suffer from depression or behavioral difficulties; rather, they adjust to their circumstances reasonably well. Following the onset of disability and subsequent rehabilitation, then, many individuals report relatively favorable levels of subjective well-being (SWB) and happiness, and that they take pleasure in daily life, including work, play, and interactions with family and friends. The focus of this chapter is those individuals who exhibit positive reactions to living with disability. We hope that products and insights from their positive responses can develop new or revised existing therapies to promote the health and well-being of others, the goal of rehabilitation psychology. Our discussion is grounded in the theoretical and empirical perspectives of positive psychology; the constructive, person-situation focus of rehabilitation psychology; and the approaches emerging from the synergy of both research areas. Positive psychology emphasizes three complementary foci: subjective states, individual processes, and the creation and maintenance of positive social institutions. Against the backdrop of acquired physical disability, we consider the first two foci by examining happiness and then resiliency and positive growth. We then consider the implications of our review for future research and therapy.",

      "abstract": "This chapter's shows that human error is inevitable and largely predictable because of a combination of the natural limitations of human performance and inadequate design of many healthcare systems. Errors can be divided into two main groups: active and latent. Active errors are committed by front-line staff and tend to have direct patient consequences. Latent errors create the conditions, context and potential for active errors. Non-technical skills are the cognitive, social and personal resource skills that complement a professional's technical skills. Team leadership involves directing and coordinating the activities of team members. Skills in this regard include encouraging team members to work together, delegating tasks, developing knowledge, skills and abilities as well as motivating, planning, organising and fostering a positive team atmosphere. Human factors is concerned with work-related behaviour, performance and well-being as a result of the interactions and interfaces between professionals, equipment and technology, tasks and systems, and the wider organisational environment.",

      "abstract": "Being financially literate is an important life skill that is equally important for one's own sake as well as for society. Findings indicate that individuals are financially illiterate while interventions to increase the level of financial literacy are ineffective. The effect of financial literacy on financial behavior reported in correlation studies may be driven by some unknown third variable, such as individual cognitive ability. The current study investigated the role of cognitive and emotional factors in attaining financial literacy. In a representative sample of the general population, our regression models indicate that a central component of financial literacy can be traced to numeracy and the emotional attitude towards numbers (i.e. mathematics anxiety). Thus, a driving force behind becoming financially literate resides in the ability to understand numbers and having an emotional attitude towards numbers that does not interfere with an individual's daily engagement in activities involving mathematics and financial decisions.",

It is argued that when basic methodological issues intrinsic to psychophysiological and paced/self-paced studies in general are considered, along with an analysis in terms of both short-(trial-by-trial as well as trial components) term and long-term (entire task) psychophysiological and behavioral responses, the task of locating and evaluating stress within the paced/self-paced work environment becomes less elusive.

Ten conceivable states of affairs are described, which if proved to contribute to or be indicated by measured intelligence would legitimize the assertion that a statement about someone's intelligence can help to explain their degree of success at mental tasks. These are that level of intelligence is reliably related to (1) observable physiological variables, (2) variability in basic mental processing mechanisms, (3) the capacity to learn or remember, (4) fundamental thinking skills, (5) the ability to reason abstractly, (6) the complexity of a person's cognitive functioning, (7) adaptability or mental flexibility, (8) executive controlling functions, or (9) unspecified biological mechanisms, or (10) that indications of measured intelligence level precisely identify intellectual qualities that an individual possesses. The evidence fails to provide firm confirmation of the existence of any of these 10 states of affairs, indicating that measures of intelligence level have little or no explanatory value.",

      "abstract": "There are as least three powerful insights from recent studies of the brain that support cognitive science research findings: First, our brains learn and process two very different types of knowledge; non conscious, automated knowledge and conscious, controllable, declarative knowledge. Evidence also suggests that we believe we control our own learning by conscious choice when in fact nearly all mental operations are highly automated, including learning and problem solving; Second, human beings have a very limited capacity to think during learning and problem solving and when that capacity is exceeded, thinking and learning stop without us being aware. Thus instruction and self managed learning must strive to avoid cognitive overload; and Third, nearly all of our instructional design and cyber learning theories and models fail to account for the influence of non-conscious cognitive processes and therefore are inadequate to deal with complex learning and performance. Evidence for these points will be described and their implications for instruction and the learning of problem solving and higher order thinking skills will be discussed. Models of learning and instruction that appear to help overcome some of these biological and cognitive barriers will be described. In addition, suggestions for new research questions on interactive learning environments that take account of the three insights will also be described.",

Problems are those situations for which an immediate and easily recognisable solution is not apparent. The impact of these problems upon an individual’s psychological functioning depends on their particular circumstances. An individual’s personal coping skills form a link between problems and whether psychological symptoms develop. These coping skills are the result not only of personality and previous experience, but also may fluctuate depending on whether the individual is suffering from a psychological illness. The appraisal of problems as challenging or threatening, and the individual’s self-perception as possessing robust or fragile coping skills, will also play a part in whether problems lead to the development of psychological symptoms.",

      "abstract": "This paper is an introduction to a topic that most health professionals are likely to encounter at some time in their career. It has been derived from a review of the relevant literature and from work with people with cerebral palsy who challenge services. Challenging behaviour is relatively common among people with learning disabilities, particularly when the learning disability is severe in nature. It also occurs, although less frequently, in other groups where there may be severe physical disability involving deficits in social and expressive language skills or additional sensory impairment. There are potentially serious consequences for the person who displays challenging behaviour, not least of which are the possibilities of limited learning experiences and social isolation. Unless the behaviour of people displaying challenging behaviour is properly understood and addressed, it will be difficult to involve them in structured activities. Their quality of life will, as a consequence, be seriously impaired. For those who self-abuse causing repeated physical injury to themselves, there may be permanent physical damage and disfigurement. Understanding challenging behaviour is the first step to a recognition that all people, regardless of disability, have a right to be included in the structure of mainstream society.",

The aim of this paper is to present an update of Executive Function (EF) Rehabilitation Techniques. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature review using the following keywords: executive function, mental disorders and rehabilitation in the PubMed, specific journals and books. Results: There is evidence of improvement of EF using some rehabilitation techniques, such as goal planning, goal management training, problem solving training, verbalization, drill and practice approach, metacognitive strategy instruction, computer-assisted training and neurofeedback. However, impact of rehabilitation on daily life remains poorly understood. Conclusion: Executive Dysfunction (ED) may be remediated and/or compensated at a certain degree by neuropsychological rehabilitation, but there is still a great challenge in this area based on how to measure effectiveness of EF interventions on daily life. There is a need for the development of new and/or combined techniques (i.e., pharmacological treatment, deep-brain stimulation) for a broader impact on quality of life for patients.",

      "abstract": "Today, one of the most important indicators of a country's development level is the reading rate of that country. Studies show that the reading rate is quite low in our country. This situation has many reasons such as social, psychological and traditional ones. One of the most important reasons is the lack of reading education. &#x0D; Reading is a rich activity combining vision, recognition, comprehension, inquiry, comprehension, speaking, writing and production. Completing the process with all these actions makes the reader active reader. The effective reading of individuals who have acquired basic reading skills depends on the enrichment of activities with comprehension, speaking, writing and production activities during reading process. Effective one is a reader who likes reading, spends time with reading, questions what he reads, makes written and oral text, and can use his readings for himself and his community and makes inferences from the readings. Effective reading makes the reading activity of the person pleasant. The individual discovers something new like an exploration at every stage after basic reading through seeing, recognizing and understanding. These discoveries trigger creativity that includes imagination as well as past experiences. The easiest and shortest way of reaching the pleasure of producing something is experienced with effective reading.&#x0D; Giving importance to reading education in schools, teaching effective reading methods to students and providing them with feasible and sustainable reading projects will make a significant contribution to educating a generation who read, write, speak and produce in our country.&#x0D; In this study, the reading group activity, which is applied with a group of secondary school (high school) students, was introduced and the practicing results of the activity were evaluated.The target group of the students is 9th, 10th and 11th grade students. The target audience was firstly informed about effective-critical reading and reading group activity was introduced. The application based on voluntary participation was started with a reading group consisting of six people. In the following times, participation increased and fifteen reading groups, each consisting of six and seven individuals, were formed in the three months. During the reading process, groups were guided and process evaluations were made. In order for the groups participating in the event to share their reading experiences with other students, it was provided to make presentations in the Z-library and arrange a book interview. Moreover, the reading activities of the groups within the scope of the Libraries Week were presented to the visitors through posters and presentations. Presentations were recorded with photographs and videos. It has been observed that reading group activity, which became widespread in school in a short time, increased the interest of students in reading and library. Students have learned the effective-critical reading of the role-tasks offered by the group readings, and have gained other skills such as orienting their readings, making reading preferences, and distinguishing qualified works. Reading group activity is an effective reading method which can be applied in all schools under the guidance of Turkish and literature teachers and supports active-critical reading, reading habits and culture.",

      "abstract": "What expert intuition is and isn'tThis chapter concerns expert intuition, the coping skill that develops in a domain after an individual with innate talent has considerable learning experience accompanied by an awareness of the quality of each performance.Commonly, but not exclusively, such skill involves a sequence of behaviors.Examples of the sort of skillful coping that I have in mind include driving a car on an empty road, reading and understanding the nuances of social situations, a chess master making moves during a game of fast chess, and the actions of an experienced firefighting-team commander.These particular examples are designated as expert intuition and are listed among examples of fast thinking in the recent best-selling book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman (2011, p. 11, 21,22).Three of these examples are of conventionally recognized skills, but the one involving social behavior is also typical of what I have in mind.Acting or reacting in familiar sorts of situations such as in the examples above, I shall argue, should not be regarded as decision-making, thinking, or mental activity in the conventional usage of these terms.In fact, most of our adult life is spent exhibiting learned intuitive forms of expertise that are so effortless that they are taken for granted.They are cases of individuals knowing automatically, quickly, and effortlessly, how to proceed in situations without being able to explain their performance.For an example of a firefighter taking for granted what Kahneman and most cognitive psychologists would call decision-making see Klein (2011, p 88, 89).Intuitive experts generally will be able to recall various helpful rules and principles that they learned as beginners that might help a novice but not an expert, and some also may, if interrogated, invent various rules and principles that they believe that they now use, but I shall argue that these will not be the correct explanation of their behavior.I am not concerned here with individuals behaving in situations of a type that have not often been encountered previously or that have been encountered but without feedback on quality of performance.These situations involve some conscious thinking, and while deciding may be fast compared to employing effortful reasoning and deliberation, the subjects' responses are generally not as rapid and effortless as are the behaviors exhibited by experienced intuitive experts in situations such as those cited in paragraph one above.",

This deficit, which probably originated prior to AH's birth or in the early years of her life, affects high-level vision and causes distinctive location and orientation errors in a wide range of visual tasks. The deficit may also affect AH's ability to acquire knowledge in circumstances where processing of visual location and/or orientation information is implicated in the learning process (e.g., learning to spell).",

      "abstract": "In this paper tThe author analyzes the methodology of coaching seen as a method of practical developmental practical domain and as a profession. It emerged as an independent instrument of help in the development and realization of human potential, and today coaching is viewed as a self-sufficient, fully formed discipline and profession. Meanwhile, there is a range of methodological and theoretical issues that remain open as they don’t find understandingremain unresolved in the numerous works on the topic and in training programs. These issues became are the focus of consideration in the presentis paper. Among the issues discussed are the general state of things in coaching, its foundations, sources, and interventions, as well as its associations with psychology, psychotherapy, and contemporary research. The notion is substantiated that coaching has to be considered as a form of psychological practice because the objects of work in coaching work are primarily psychological characteristics (motivation, goals, emotions, images, subjective time, psychological resources, achievements, limiting attitudes, talents, strengths, planning, development, education, optimal functioning, strategies of life, choice, decision-making, obligations, action, self-regulation, relationships in organization, management tasks, effectiveness in officiating, dedication, well-being, and leadership). Interpretations are given to some popular notions and models of coaching, and key flaws in the basis of its methodology are providedsuggested, such as: grounds in the outdated psychological models and theories, ; selective use of the modern ideas, ; appellation to pseudopsychological notions, ; use of concepts about the brain as an explanatory model for behavior; and dynamics of changes in the a person. As an alternative, a range of original, deep and explanatory theories and models are given, created in the framework of the psychology of motivation, the psychology of personality, and the psychology of behavior. The value of the idea of evidence-based practices and research on effectiveness of coaching interventions is shown. The phenomenon of hope rising as an effect of coaching -sessions is discussed. The cCentral place is given to the analysis and development of one basic approach, the positive psychology coaching. Its specific aspects and thematic areas referred to within the coach-client work activity are presented, including positivity, flow, strengths and virtues, time perspective, pleasure, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy.",

      "abstract": "On average, psychological variables are often statistically different in people living in poverty compared with people living in affluence. The default academic response to this pattern is often the deficit model: Poverty damages or impairs brain function, which leads to poor performance that only exacerbates the poverty. Deficits and damage are real phenomena. However, there are also other processes: People living in poverty may have made reasonable psychological responses to their circumstances or may have developed strengths that enhance their ability to cope with challenges in their lives. We illustrate these points by discussing the linked examples of time preference, early reproduction, and hidden talents. We argue for a balanced approach to the psychology of poverty that integrates deficit and strengths-based models. Future research could focus on the ways in which impairment and adaptation interact.",

This paper is a culmination of various studies in EI which indicate that Emotional Intelligence can add essence to life. To provide greater focus and direction to the readers, the studies have been divided into the following sub-topics: Concept of EI, Models of EI, Skills in EI, Contribution of EI to enhance quality of life. Emotional Intelligence forms the foundation for enhanced learning, optimal relationships and effective decision-making.EI, according to Nancy Gibbs (1995) of TIME magazine “may be the best predictor of success in life.” Believing that cognitive ability plays a rather limited role in accounting for why some people are more successful than others, Daniel Goleman (1995) agreed with Salovey and Mayer's work in the early 1990's. Displaced anger, violence and aggression, failed relationships, crimes, abuses, well, the list seems endless! All these have one thing in common…..emotions.Words uttered in haste, out of place actions, reactions instead of responses, no signs of forgiving and letting go add to the woes. The missing piece in this beautiful puzzle of life seems to be unattended, ignored and repressed emotions. Inspite of theories and models, it can be concluded that EI with regard to application in everyday life has not been researched enough.“Nurturing Values and Strengths in Individuals and Society: Role of Psychology” being the theme for the conference, it is of utmost importance that we at this juncture in life, take a step back and evaluate why are there so many crimes in this world of fast track technology?

      "title": "Exploring the Relationship between Empathy and Innovation among Engineering Students",
      "abstract": "Abstract Exploring the Relationship between Empathy and Innovation within Engineering Within engineering education research there seems to be a consensus that innovation isan important and even essential component of succeeding as a practicing engineer. Innovationmay be described as the creative act of generating novel concepts, processes, or designs. It maybe described as incremental, leading to small changes, or radical, leading to a completerethinking of existing practices or designs or entirely new concepts altogether. Further,innovation may be broken up of its constituent components by identifying what skills or traits arenecessary for being innovative. The Innovator’s DNA, for example, identified questioning, ideanetworking, experimenting, and observation as the key traits exemplified by innovativeexecutives. The Innovator’s DNA has even developed a self-report instrument to measure eachof these behaviors (see attachment). This paper explores whether another specific trait may be connected to innovation:empathy. Using a model developed out of social psychology, we define empathy as a multi-faceted phenomenon built upon four distinct sub-constructs; (a) fantasy or the tendency toimagine yourself in another person’s situation, (b) perspective-taking or the tendency to thinkabout how others are thinking or feeling, (c) empathic concern or the tendency to demonstratecare and concern for others, and (d) personal distress or the tendency to become anxious in tensesituations. What we put into question is whether any or all of these components of empathy arerelated to any or all of the components of innovation depicted by the Innovator’s DNA. Our guiding research question for this study is, “From the perspective of engineeringstudents, what is the relationship between empathy and innovation?” As a data collectionstrategy, we invited students at a large Mid-Western University to complete each of the twosurveys. Upon completion of the surveys students had the opportunity to volunteer in a follow-upinterview. More than one-hundred survey responses were collected along with nine semi-structured interviews ranging from one hour to one and a half hours in length. The data wasanalyzed using two distinct phases of research analysis. In the first research phase, wequantitatively explore whether the four distinct sub-constructs of empathy (perspective-taking,empathic concern, personal distress, and fantasy) have a correlated relationship to these fourinnovative behavior traits (questioning, idea networking, experimenting, or observation). Second,we qualitatively explore the same nine students’ perceptions of the correlations reported betweenthe empathy and innovation scales. Results from this study will inform the body of engineering education knowledge bygenerating the first concerted discourse around empathy, innovation, and engineering. Namely,this study will indicate whether specific components of empathy catalyze or inhibit innovativeengineering, and in turn, which components engineering educators should focus on whenteaching for innovation.Innovator’s DNA Survey Items (Labeled Constructs) Dimension # Survey Item Questioning – Asking 1 I often ask questions that challenge the status quo. questions in order to challenge I am constantly asking questions to understand why products and 7 projects underperform. inherent assumptions and 10 I am constantly asking questions to get at the root of the problem. increase understanding of a 13 I am always asking questions. topic or context. 14 Others are frustrated by the frequency of my questions.

      "title": "Learning from Multiple Representations",
      "abstract": "Learning from multiple representations (MRs) is not an easy task for most people, despite how easy it is for experts. Different combinations of representations (e.g., text + photograph, graph + formula, map + diagram) pose different challenges for learners, but across the literature researchers find these to be challenging learning tasks. Each representation typically includes some unique information, as well as some information shared with the other representation(s). Finding one piece of information is only somewhat challenging, but linking information across representations and especially making inferences are very challenging and important parts of using multiple representations for learning. Coordination of multiple representations skills are rarely taught in classrooms, despite the fact that learners are frequently tested on them. Learning from MRs depends on the specific learning tasks posed, learner characteristics, the specifics of which representation(s) are used, and the design of each representation. These various factors act separately and in combination (which can be compensatory, additive, or interactive). Learning tasks can be differentially effective depending on learner characteristics, especially prior knowledge, self-regulation, and age/grade. Learning tasks should be designed keeping this differential effectiveness in mind, and researchers should test for such interactions.",

Thus, they become an exercise in social science theorizing and a research tool to examine the implications of hypothesized relationships and conflict dynamics in a variety of forms (abstract plays or role-playing activities). By emphasizing needs, interpretations, stereotypes and resources of all participants, simulation plays facilitate strategies for resilience and reconciliation.",

Seen as a biomedical entity, psychologists' inputs focus on the emotional consequences of disability and on facilitating coping with the condition. By contrast, when disability is seen as behavioural, psychology's capacity to describe, measure, explain, and intervene to change behaviour become more pertinent. Disability is therefore a challenging topic for psychology and many branches have important things to contribute to our understanding of this subject. Whereas educational, occupational, clinical, and social psychology deal mainly with the context and consequences of disability, the focus in health psychology is on disability per se.",

The psychiatric clinician reduces complex mental states and behaviors into diagnosis and formulation before considering the need for and the modality of treatment. The psychiatric researcher explains human behavior with mechanistic models of disease progression and outcome. The resulting psychiatric discourse is confusing, with competing explanatory models, terminologies, and treatment philosophies. Here I will develop the idea that hypothesis testing in psychiatry is shaped by two questions: 1) How strongly can we reduce mental states and behavior? and 2) How much does the person seek and require treatment? If answers to these questions are aligned, it facilitates research and preserves autonomy. Misalignment impedes scientific progress and leads to wasteful debates. Psychiatry needs to balance scientific reductionism with respect of agency and self-efficacy.",

      "title": "Minding and mending the gap: Social psychological interventions to reduce educational disparities",
      "abstract": "Background Achievement gaps continue to garner a great deal of attention both in academic and in popular circles. Many students continue to struggle despite broad educational reforms aimed at narrowing these gaps in learning and performance. Aims In this article, we review a number of social psychological interventions that show promise in reducing gaps in achievement, not by addressing structural barriers to achievement, but by helping students cope with threats to their identity that impair intellectual functioning and motivation. For example, interventions involving meditation, role models, emotional reappraisal, growth mindsets, imagining possible selves, self-affirmations, belongingness and cooperative learning have been shown to ameliorate threats to identity and raise achievement. We describe and evaluate these social psychological interventions. Arguments Many achievement gaps involve a psychological predicament: a threat to one's social identity or to one's sense of belonging. Students' implicit theories – how they mind the gap – can act as barriers to their success. By helping students cope with these threats, these theory-based interventions represent a genuine advance in the way schools may reduce gaps in achievement. Conclusion These interventions show how students' educational success depends partly on fluid aspects of context – how tasks are framed, who else is in the room, or what they believe about intelligence. Because of this fluidity, these interventions may not work in all settings. Achievement gaps are ultimately caused by a variety of factors, both objective and subjective that produce inequality. The research reviewed here suggests that even without changes in objective barriers to success, brief psychological interventions can narrow what many see as intractable gaps in academic achievement.",

El estres puede ser producido por diferentes circunstancias, las cuales son diferentes para cada persona y estas se presentan en diferentes aspectos de la vida del individuo, es decir, se puede presentar a nivel familiar, educativo, profesional, entre otros dependiendo el individuo que se desee analizar. “… Recibir una calificacion reprobatoria en un examen de fisica, llegar considerablemente tarde a una junta importante, o jugar tiempos extra a muerte subita en un partido de hockey”. (Hughes, Ginnett, & Curphy, 2007, p. 456)\r\nEl presente trabajo se enfoca en el estres laboral, ya que es fundamental para la toma de decisiones, actividad de alta importancia en la gestion directiva, por lo cual se estudiara el efecto que tiene el estres en la toma de decisiones a niveles empresariales. El estres laboral ha sido estudiado desde hace mas de tres decadas por lo que es posible encontrar definiciones al respecto; McGrath, en 1970 definio el estres laboral como “el desequilibrio sustancial (percibido) entre la demanda y la capacidad de respuesta del individuo bajo condiciones en las que el fracaso ante esta demanda posee importantes consecuencias (percibidas)”. (Navarro, 2009, p. 86) A partir de esta definicion se podria asumir que el estres laboral tiene un efecto sobre la toma de decisiones sin importar el cargo que el individuo desempene. \r\nCon el fin de entender y aportar a la administracion como disciplina un recurso mas para comprender este concepto de la psicologia que tiene implicaciones en las organizaciones y en la forma en que los directivos toman decisiones, y asi puedan apropiarlas a su diario vivir dentro de las organizaciones, se realizara una monografia que estara basada principalmente en articulos y libros que han introducido este tema anteriormente, pero que no han dado a conocer estos avances a la linea administrativa. \r\nFinalmente, con los resultados esperados en esta investigacion, aparte de dar a conocer a los administradores los avances de aquellas ciencias sociales existentes anteriormente a la administracion y que permiten que el desarrollo administrativo sea mejor, aportando al desarrollo de las capacidades profesionales de los gerentes y empresarios, se espera describir los factores externos que afectan al estres e identificar como este afecta la toma de decisiones en la direccion.",

      "title": "Investigating Feature Set Decisions for Mental State Decoding in Virtual Reality based Learning Environments",
      "abstract": "In modern workplaces with rapidly changing skill requirements, suitable training and learning environments play a key role for companies to remain competitive, effective and ensure job satisfaction. To provide an immersive, interactive, and engaging learning experience, Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a revolutionary technology. Especially when erroneous behaviour is associated with severe consequences or great resources, VR offers the opportunity to explore actions and visualize consequences in safely and at affordable costs. In addition, it provides an easy way to personalize educational content, learning speed, and/or format to the individual to guarantee a good fit with skills and needs. This is decisive, since insufficient or excessive workload during training sessions results in demotivation and reduced performance. In the latter case, persistent professional exhaustion, pressure to succeed and stress can lead to long-term psychological consequences for employees. Besides skill and ability, current physical conditions (e.g., illness or fatigue) and psychological states (e.g., motivation) also affect the learning performance. To identify and monitor individual mental states, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) measuring neurophysiological activation patterns, e.g., with an electroencephalography (EEG), or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be integrated in a VR-learning environment. Recently, fNIRS, a mobile optical brain imaging technique, has become popular for real-world applications due to its good usability, portability, and ease of use. For the reliable online decoding of mental states, informative neuronal patterns, suitable methods for pre-processing and artefact removal, as well as efficient machine learning algorithms for the classification need to be explored. We, therefore, investigated and decoded different working memory states in a free moving fNIRS experiment presented in VR. different working memory states in a free moving fNIRS VR experiment and the possibility of decoding these states properly. 11 volunteers (four female, right-handed, mean age of 23.73, SD = 1.42, range = 21−26 years) participated in the study. The experimental task was a colour-based visuo-spatial n-back paradigm adapted from Lühmann and colleagues (2019) with a low (1-back) and high working memory load condition (3-back) and a 0-back condition as active baseline. Brain activity was recorded using the mobile NIRx NIRSport2. To capture brain activation patterns associated with working memory load, optode montage was designed to optimally cover the prefrontal cortex (PFC; in particular, dorso- and ventrolateral parts of the PFC) with some lateral restriction by the VR head-mounted display (HMD). fNIRS signals were processed using the python-toolbox mne and mne-nirs. For the decoding of working memory load, we extracted statistical features, that are peak, minimum, average, slope, peak-to-peak, and time-to-peak, from epochs of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration per channel. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting classifier (XGBoost) were explored and compared to a Dummy classifier (empirical chance level). We also investigated which cortical regions contributed to the decoding when choosing single features and which feature combination was suggested to optimize performance. With this study, we aim to provide empirically supported decision recommendations to reach the next step towards future online decoding pipelines in real-world VR-based learning applications.",

Wellbeing literacy is a capability, rather than a positive psychology intervention (PPI) per se.

The five necessary conditions for wellbeing literacy are outlined to stimulate discussion of ways to operationalise and measure this construct to enable better PPI implementation and evaluation. In the context of PPIs, the empirical question remains: Is wellbeing literacy a mediator or moderator of wellbeing outcomes?",

      "abstract": "Philosophical training within a psychiatric context has been traditionally seen as an out- or metapsychiatric activity, not directly associated with the outcomes of psychiatric therapeutic interventions, whether they belong to the realm of psychoanalysis/psychotherapy or to that of biological psychiatry. Yet, psychiatry's subject matter (personal psychopathology), current status of scientific knowledge and research, as well as marked inefficiency of many psychiatric treatments suggest that we might consider novel ontological, epistemological/epistemic, and ethical parameters that could both enrich psychiatric philosophical thought and enhance psychiatric therapeutic practice by rendering it more efficient. Within a realistic empiricist context, in view of revising currently used diagnostic manuals (DSM-IV and ICD-10), related discourses are proposed to focus upon doctor-patient relationship. This raises ontological (diagnostic, nosographical), epistemological (related to contexts, boundaries, and methods of psychiatric knowledge), and ethical questions (as per moral significance of both quality and fullness of doctor-patient relationship regarding outcomes of treatment administered), which, in their turn till now are either ignored or superficially dealt with by traditional biomedical -psychiatric in particular- philosophy. Within this context, certain suggestions are offered towards a renewal of psychiatric philosophical thought by indicating novel research orientations for scrutiny, with the aim to optimize psychiatric practice.",

      "title": "Cognitive remediation for severe mental illness: state of the field and future directions",
      "abstract": "After more than 20 years of studies examining the methods, efficacy and effectiveness of cognitive remediation for severe mental illness, this therapy is recognized as evidence-based for schizophrenia and is emerging in clinical practice. As with all behavioral interventions, this period of development has not been without its criticisms, trial failures, and practical concerns about implementation. Recent innovations in cognitive remediation have focused on refining treatment techniques, broadening its application from schizophrenia to other severe mental illnesses, personalizing treatment, and increasing the likelihood of transfer to everyday functioning. The Cognitive Remediation Expert Working Group defines cognitive remediation as a \"behavioral training intervention targeting cognitive deficit (attention, memory, executive function, social cognition, or metacognition), using scientific principles of learning, with the ultimate goal of improving functional outcomes. Its effectiveness is enhanced when provided in a context (formal or informal) that provides support and opportunity for extending to everyday functioning\" . There are several different approaches to cognitive remediation. Core features include using cognitive training techniques, typically computerized to enhance neuroplasticity; therapist-guided development and refinement of problem-solving strategies that can be used during cognitive training and in daily life; and facilitating the transfer of cognitive gains and new strategies to daily life. Effect sizes have been reliably demonstrated to be medium for cognitive improvements1. When including therapists and a context for developing living skills (such as vocational rehabilitation or social skills training), effects on functioning are medium to large1. Allied approaches that are generally not considered cognitive remediation therapy are cognitive training (often using only independent computer-based training) and compensatory techniques that do not focus on enhancing cognition but instead modify the environment so that the persistent cognitive deficits produce less disability. Although the evidence for cognitive remediation is clear, there are several factors within and across diagnoses that might help guide the continued development of this therapy. Transdiagnostic issues such as anhedonia, negative attributions about cognitive abilities, and reduced access to a cognitively enriching ecosystem, are likely to interfere with the efficacy and effectiveness of the therapy, yet are not often explicitly woven into treatment procedures. These features also help us understand that cognitive remediation is not simply brain training delivered by a computer, but a therapy that will be most successful when therapists bring knowledge of neurocognitive dysfunction and skills from cognitive and behavioral treatment techniques. Low motivation is a cardinal feature across severe mental illnesses and a robust predictor of engagement with psychotherapies2. Examination of recruitment and retention statistics in cognitive remediation studies reveals a pattern of difficulty with engagement that is similar to issues faced in other psychotherapies, with attrition rates as high as 50% and low adherence to homework. Addressing the effects of anhedonia will be critical to the successful implementation of cognitive remediation. Recent work has found that patient-determined scheduling3 and motivational interviewing4 can improve outcomes and engagement. In addition to motivational issues, core negative beliefs about cognitive ability are likely to manifest within the cognitive remediation environment and may serve to suppress treatment effects. Those with severe mental illness tend to underestimate their cognitive and functional abilities, leading them to avoid cognitively challenging activities during treatment and in daily life. In the cognitive remediation treatment environment, a therapist is thus needed to play a key role in refocusing the patient on the goal of approaching cognitive challenges. Ongoing work is examining, in both experimental and treatment trial studies, the ideal techniques for addressing negative beliefs about cognitive abilities, attributions of how these abilities can be useful in daily life, and motivating patients to approach cognitive challenges. The ultimate goal of having cognitive improvements transfer to daily life skills and outcomes is challenging for many people with mental illness who have lived for long periods of time in a cognitively understimulating ecosystem. This represents a measurement and treatment issue, since behavior change often lags behind more proximal treatment effects, and the patient's social, vocational and home environment might not present ideal opportunities for cognitive enrichment. It will thus be critical for cognitive remediation studies to measure change in functioning outcomes that is contextualized within the patient's environment and to continue to examine behavior change in the long term. From a treatment perspective, future enhancements to cognitive remediation might examine how to bridge cognitive changes to daily life functioning. For patients with difficulties with memory and abstraction, it might be insufficient to rely only on discussion of how to bridge what is learned during treatment and recall it in a novel future environment. Taken together, these findings point toward the potential of incorporating principles from more traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies into cognitive remediation. One such program, Action-Based Cognitive Remediation, uses goal setting, behavioral activation (with a focus on approaching cognitive challenges that the patient typically avoids), and role-plays to show how new cognitive strategies are used with real life tasks. Incorporating these techniques led to better retention and functioning outcomes5. In addition to adding to our treatment procedures, a critical area for more work in both research and clinical environments is to examine how supplemental, continued or intermittent treatment techniques affect the durability of effects. More than sustaining immediate effects, many recent cognitive remediation studies have reported a \"sleeper effect\", with larger improvements in everyday functioning in the months following treatment endpoint5, 6. As is typical with clinical trials, however, these follow-up periods are relatively brief with respect to what we often view as lifelong issues with functioning in these disorders. As the field continues to grow, with several treatment programs available, health care decision makers who wish to bring cognitive remediation to the clinic should be encouraged that, although this treatment requires training and staff time, the cost-benefit analysis is favorable. Studies of cognitive remediation have systematically reported on how this trade-off affects quality of life and financial burden associated with cognitive impairment, with evidence supporting higher rates of employment7, reduced job stress5, and lower institutional treatment demands8, 9. The trade-off will be particularly important to examine as even brief, low-intensity cognitive remediation demonstrates positive effects on cognition and functioning6, but most trials showing larger effects on functioning that are durable include a substantial role for therapists in a more treatment intensive environment1, 5. The state of cognitive remediation has moved from \"does it work\" to \"what works best for whom\" across severe mental illnesses. Personalizing the treatment in everyday clinical use will continue to benefit from more experimental studies to explore the role of mechanisms mentioned herein as well as the analysis of larger datasets, including repositories of existing data and prospective multi-site projects, to examine mediating and moderating effects. Uptake in clinical settings should be encouraged by the cost-benefit analysis of cognitive remediation, the only treatment in our armamentarium that reliably enhances the strongest predictor of functional disability – cognitive impairment.",

Psychotherapy may be provided in individual, couple, dyadic, family, group or multiple family group modalities—though this bibliography will focus only on psychotherapy with adults using an individual modality. Psychotherapy is provided by a qualified mental health professional, typically a clinical social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist or other licensed professional. Depending on the issue being addressed, psychotherapy may be provided alone or in combination with medications or other related support and service programs. Psychotherapy is a term that encompasses a wide variety of theories, methods, and techniques. Its great variety makes it difficult to define and describe succinctly. Psychotherapy has deep and longstanding roots in medicine, traditional healing, psychology, social work, nursing, and education. Various psychotherapies may draw upon single or combined theoretical foundations, may use unique or widely shared methods and techniques. The evidence base for different psychotherapies varies widely, and may take on different forms to address appropriately the theoretical premises, specific objectives, and methods employed. There are many types of psychotherapy: Wikipedia lists 150 named types; GoodTherapy.org lists 148 of the “most common” types of psychotherapy. The American Psychological Association identifies five broad approaches to psychotherapy: psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, and integrative. This bibliography will focus mainly on these five widely practiced forms of psychotherapy as well as trauma theory and therapy. This bibliography will also address the research evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychotherapy in this era of evidence-based practice.",

We first address confusion over terminology, including the descriptor noncognitive. We conclude that debate over the optimal name for this broad category of personal qualities obscures substantial agreement about the specific attributes worth measuring. Next, we discuss advantages and limitations of different measures. In particular, we compare self-report questionnaires, teacher-report questionnaires, and performance tasks, using self-control as an illustrative case study to make the general point that each approach is imperfect in its own way. Finally, we discuss how each measure’s imperfections can affect its suitability for program evaluation, accountability, individual diagnosis, and practice improvement. For example, we do not believe any available measure is suitable for between-school accountability judgments. In addition to urging caution among policymakers and practitioners, we highlight medium-term innovations that may make measures of these personal qualities more suitable for educational purposes.",

Studies show that improving Spiritual intelligence (SI) can improve everyone’s mental health. Problem-solving, meaning and purpose in life, overall well-being, resilience, and good intrapersonal and interpersonal relationships are all areas where spiritual intelligence can be employed. As Spiritual Intelligence is a key part of every human being, it focuses on numerous good results. SI is sometimes known as a spiritual quotient. Spiritual intelligence has an inevitable role in the life of every individual. It influences all stages of existence and increases mental health for one’s personal and professional progress. SI is also a helpful tool for a healthy lifestyle since it helps people to cope with stressful situations and recover from traumatic events. This article concludes that students, employees, and professionals need spiritual intelligence training to deal with challenging situations. Self-awareness and spiritual intelligence can be nurtured through mindfulness, psychotherapy, yoga, meditation, and psychoeducation. The necessities of psychological interventions are unavoidable in this present pandemic situation. Many research studies stress the importance of mental health and the need for appropriate mental health interventions.",

      "abstract": "Evidence-based recommendations for lifestyles to promote healthy cognitive aging (exercise, education, non-smoking, balanced diet, etc.) root in reductionistic studies of mostly physical measurable factors with large effect sizes. In contrast, most people consider factors like autonomy, purpose, social participation and engagement, etc. as central to a high quality of life in old age. Evidence for a direct causal impact of these factors on healthy cognitive aging is still limited, albeit not absent. Ultimately, however, individual lifestyle is a complex composite of variables relating to both body and mind as well as to receiving input and generating output. The physical interventions are tied to the more subjective and mind-related aspects of lifestyle and wellbeing in the idea of the \"embodied mind,\" which states that the mind is shaped by and requires the body. The causality is reciprocal and the process is dynamic, critically requiring movement: the \"embodied mind\" is a \"embodied mind in motion.\" Hiking, playing musical instruments, dancing and yoga are examples of body-mind activities that assign depth, purpose, meaning, social embedding, etc. to long-term beneficial physical \"activities\" and increase quality of life not only as delayed gratification. The present motivational power of embodied activities allows benefiting from the side-effects of late-life resilience. The concept offers an access point for unraveling the mechanistic complexity of lifestyle-based prevention, including their neurobiological foundations.",

      "title": "Unconditional personal self-acceptance as a humanistic trait of a psychologist",
      "abstract": "Becoming a future psychologist in a university environment is a complex and multifaceted process. This process includes the formation of professional skills, as well as the psychological enrichment of the inner world of the future psychologist. Personal and professional development of a psychologist are interconnected and combined in the process of self-development. The discovery of self-actualization horizons requires a psychologist to have a number of humanistic qualities, such as a positive attitude toward oneself and others, empathy, congruent self-expression, and confidence. Unconditional true self-acceptance is the basis of the training of an effective psychologist. Undoubted self-acceptance reflects internal recognition and respect for oneself as an individual capable of independent choices and awareness of one’s feelings, thoughts, intentions, and motives. This includes accepting yourself as a whole and benevolent-demanding attitude towards yourself. Conditional self-acceptance, on the other hand, implies a mistrustful and critical attitude towards oneself, which can violate the integrity of the individual, negate one’s own self-concept. The structure of conditional self-acceptance of future psychologists consists of three interrelated components: the inability to consciously perceive and understand one’s own emotional and sensory states, the inability to overcome protective mechanisms that prevent the acceptance of one’s own experiences and emotions, and the rejection of real inner desires and motives, which can lead to personal destructiveness. The functional structure of unconditional self-acceptance contains at least four interdependent components: awareness of one’s own emotions, body states and feelings, a positive attitude towards oneself as an individual that ensures integrity and self-development, empathy for others and their psychological support, existential openness to the world and a tendency to self-actualization. For future psychologists, unconditional self-acceptance is the basis for the formation of professional self-awareness and the ability to provide qualified assistance to clients with the psycho-existential resources of one’s own personality. It is argued that self-acceptance affects the development of such humanistic qualities as unconditional acceptance of others, empathy in relationships, the ability to be internally open to communication, the ability to establish and maintain contacts with others, as well as the ability to tolerate, dialogue, and find a compromise. The listed characteristics are the basic qualification traits-qualities of a psychologist, which effectively determine his professional success in interaction with clients. The model of the development of unconditional self-acceptance of future psychologists proposed in the article reflects a constant progressive change in the orientation of the components of the structure of self-acceptance (from conditional to unconditional), and also reveals the psychological conditions and mechanisms for the development of productive unconditional self-acceptance of an individual. To actualize and implement the latter, psychological training is presented as an integral means of developing unconditional psycho-existential self-acceptance of the personality of future psychologists.As a result, the hypothesis was confirmed that unconditional self-acceptance positively causes the development of such humanistic personality traits of future psychologists as unconditional acceptance of others, empathy, tolerance, congruence, openness.",

      "abstract": "Counselling psychology’s Professional Practice Guidelines state that psychologists will consider at all times their responsibilities to the wider (Division of Counselling Psychology, 2005, p.7). It is suggested that the way in which counselling psychologists construct their relationship with the wider world could impact on practice, training, research and counselling psychology professional identity. A critique of the extant literature found that this issue has not previously been researched. Five counselling psychologists were asked in semi-structured interviews about their responsibilities to the wider world. Foucauldian Discourse Analysis was applied to the transcript of the interviews. Different constructions of the relationship between counselling psychology and the wider world were identified in the transcript and located in four wider discourses: professionalism, scientific, social activism and guru. Common themes across responsibilities constructed by participants utilising the different discourses included: the wider world being outside of the consulting room; difficulties defining responsibilities; and responsibilities being weighty. Responsibilities to communicate knowledge were constructed using three of the discourses. Both the guru and scientific discourses were mobilised to construct responsibilities to engage with technologies of the self (Foucault, 1988). In contrast the professionalism discourse was used to construct a responsibility to perform to others in order to appear professional. The implications of these constructions for counselling psychology, and the discourses mobilised by participants, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Decision-making capacity for treatment and research raises complex conceptual issues. Given the fact that both considerations of respect for patient autonomy and beneficence/harm prevention have moral relevance in many cases, in the practice of health care the need exists to balance both in a moral responsible way. The moral concept of (mental) capacity or decisional capacity has a role to play in this balancing process. The current dominant approach towards the conceptualization and assessment of decision-making capacity, which focuses on cognition and rationality, has some serious shortcomings. In order to compensate for these shortcomings of the dominant approach, a number of alternative approaches may be promising. A first alternative focuses on issues of emotion and narrative; a second on identity and identification, and a third on dialogue and deliberation. By paying attention to the way in which people interprete their world (not only by cognition, but also by emotion), and how they shape their lives by processes of identification and communication, a broader perspective on capacity assessment in health care can be developed. Above that, these alternative approaches are less focused on the assessment of (in)capacity and more on enabling a person to become more competent through a process of empowerment, participation, and shared decision-making.",

In this manner, the cognitive approach will be more logical than empirical. Cognitive psychology alone is not able to answer the question \"Why is it that some people have difficulty following some of the cognitive norms or rules?\" Behaviorism and connectionism can make more important contributions here. In the treatment of dyslexia, emphasis must be placed on the fact that reading is a skill that requires both automatization and awareness. To have a flexible and functional combination of these, we must borrow from cognitive psychology, connectionism, and behaviorism.",

The major approaches to cognitive development stem from the work of Piaget, from the information-processing theorists of cognitive science, and from Vygotsky. Piagetian theory emphasizes the individual child as the virtually independent constructor of his or her own development, an emphasis that undervalues the contribution of other people to cognitive development and excludes teaching and cultural influences. The development of Parallel Distributed Processing or Connectionism promises progress with some of the cognitive areas that are less logical and sequential, such as the structure and acquisition of concepts. Cognitive development is the individual construction of an internal mental model of external reality. Becoming literate is a central part of cognitive development for several reasons: literacy involves many linguistic, perceptual, attentional, memory, and cognitive skills.",

      "abstract": "ions rather than real experience. Spitze maintains that lectures, reading, and class discussions are only 7% as ef fective as real experiences, such as field trips or volunteer activities. Many young people are almost completely disassoci ated from real physical challenges or emo tional risks, which are a factor in the ap peal of crime to many students. A real ex perience is needed, real contact with one's environment. Initiative activities are an acceptable outlet for the need to be active ly involved in challenging activities that penetrate the fog of abstractions and get the adrenalin flowing. Initiative activities are readily adaptable to almost ny classroom subject. The Electric Fence could be used to illuminate a history lesson dealing with World War II, or to demonstrate social psychology in action, or to give a creative writing class an exciting first-person escape story to write. Techniques in problem solving are practiced, and these may help a math class: After one or two successful experi ences, the students become sharper at analyzing and thinking through problems. Initiative activities can complement com petitive team sports for physical educa tion classes. Environmental awareness is heightened when the activities are con ducted outside, especially in a wilderness setting. For any experience to make an impres sion, there must be ego involvement on the part of the participant. The do-I-dare try-it element makes initiative activities highly attractive as the students decide to see how they measure up to the tests, both physically and mentally. Emotions run high, from self-doubt and fear to triumph at climbing over the 12-foot wall and perhaps becoming something of a hero by helping someone who was even less confi dent. Turning uncertainties to triumphs is a great boost to the self-esteem. In our modern society much of the risk and un certainty has been eliminated, leaving crime as the last frontier for the ad venturous. Risk is a genuine need for peo ple of all ages. Accepting the challenge is the first step to a healthy self-concept, and initiative activities are a valuable tool for making that step. Anything that represents an obstacle can become an initiative activity ? a wall, a beam lashed between two trees, a giant pipeline, an overhead catwalk or balcony. A river or a swamp can easily be estab lished with strings or pegs, in the absence of the real commodity. To increase the difficulty of the challenge, have the group haul along a cumbersome object, such as old tires, a heavy ammunition box full of bricks, or an empty 55-gallon drum. The instructor's role is to make certain all objectives, rules, and penalties are clearly understood. He must preserve the freedom and spontaneity of the activity by allowing participants to solve the problem in their own way. Nothing is accom plished if the instructor gives away the solution. If the group is hopelessly stumped, however, he may offer a few clues or move on to the next activity and return later. Safety is the first consideration in all activities. Knots and ropework must be supervised, and the instructor should ex plain and demonstrate spotting tech niques. Hanging upside down, overstrain ing, or any other unsafe procedure must be stopped immediately. Group size should be no more than 15 or less than about eight. Smaller groups are best for younger children, and mixed groups of males and females are pre ferred. All school-age children respond well to initiative activities, but children in grades 4-12 seem to have the best experi ences. Whatever the subject the teacher is re inforcing with initiative activities, the most vital part of the activity is the follow up discussion. Open-ended questions can be used, or a group discussion with the in structor playing only as large a part as necessary. Identify the symbolism of the activity and explain the students' feelings and reactions. Analyze the cause and ef fect of the outcome of the games and discuss possible alternatives. Finally, draw some conclusions that will help the par ticipants to cope with similar situations that may arise in the real world, such as dealing with fears in themselves and others. Leadership and followership situa tions can be the subject of discussion. For further information on initiative activities, write to Brigham Young Uni versity Press, Provo, UT 84602. D Alternative Education at Syosset High School by William T. Plunkett The Syosset (New York) High School provides a unique opportunity for its stu dents to pursue specialized academic topics or gain firsthand experience in a possible career choice. Over 130 students were involved last year in our Alternative Education Program, pursuing educational goals above and beyond the classroom. The program is divided into on campus and off-campus segments. Appli cation for either division is open to all students. Each student submits a proposal in contract form. All projects are for one term but can be renewed. In this sense, the students are self-selected, but the final decision on the validity of the project pro posal is made by the director of the pro gram. The on-campus program empha sizes research, and the more traditional academic disciplines are approached on a tutorial basis. The off-campus projects provide hands-on career experiences in a professional atmosphere on a volunteer basis. Teachers serve as project advisors for the in-school program. No formal recruit ment exists; usually the student asks a teacher to oversee his project, or one is selected by the director. The final decision regarding project advisement is always the teacher's. These selective methods have proven very effective, because the pro gram can call on the expertise of the entire professional staff. Project flexibility is en anced dramatically with this total faculty po ential. The program is funded entirely by the Syosset Public School District. Currently it costs the school district $9,000 a year, plus 80% of the director's salary. The director retains a one-fifth guidance re sponsibility for professional reasons. The guidance department provides valuable assistance in many ways. The overall dropout rate is small. Dur ing the 1978-79 school year a total of 132 students were accepted for the program. Only six were dropped for failure to fulfill their contract. This is a retention rate of 95.5%. The lowest retention rate in the 15-year history of the program was 92.1%. Evalu tion of such a highly individual program is a difficult task and is ac complished in several ways. An effort is made to match the evaluation procedure to the purpose of the student's project. In the case of the research program within the school, the project advisors submit monthly progress reports to the director. Interim conversations are held with advisors and students as the situation dictates. Final evaluation comes, of course, with the finished project. Where appropriate, the project is bound, cata logued, and placed in the school library. The off-campus program demands a peripatetic director and a more specific evaluation procedure. The director visits each student on his project site at least once per term. He also visits cooperating WILLIAM T. PL UNKETT is director of al ternative education, Syosset (N Y.)

      "abstract": "This work is a longitudinal study of preadolescent and adolescent pupils' scholastic and vocational preferences and career options. The affective and motivational mechanisms and the cognitive processes of this evolution were studied in real time, using a clinical method of interviewes repeated each year for each subject of the sample population. A model was developped, both as pattern for the interviewes and decoding system for utterances. The vocational development is a progressive en between self assessment, professional representations and the self. Once identified the connections, and i mean by connections comparative reflexion, probabilistic reflexion and implicative reflexion dominated by two metadiscursive categories, implicit of and metareflexion - they undergo content analysis. The vocational development is essentially affective and cognitive decentration. Vocational thought ranges from the syncretic to the operatory, from magic to probabilistic thought, from identification to objectivation. Various processes such as sublimating desire or rationalising mourning lead the subject to the project within a time perspective consistant and signposted and through the insertion in scholastic and social reality. Career orientation is considered here as a fundamental aspect of the adolescent's socialisation. \nCette these est une etude longitudinale des preferences et des choix d'orientation, scolaires ou professionnels, de l'adolescent de college. J ai etudie les mecanismes affectivo-motivationnels et cognitifs de cette evolution, dans sa duree reelle, par une methode clinique d'entretiens repetes chaque annee aupres de chaque sujet de la population de recherche. J ai construit un modele, a la fois canevas de l'entretien et systeme de dechiffrage des enonces : le developpement vocationnel est une mise en tension progressive entre le moi, les representations professionnelles et l'auto-evaluation. Les connexions ainsi reperees - reflexion comparative, probabiliste, et implicative, surplombees par deux categories meta- discursives, les theories implicites de l'orientation et la metareflexion - sont soumises a l'analyse de contenu : la trame du developpement vocationnel est un processus essentiel de decentration affective et cognitive. La pensee vocationnelle va du syncretique vers l'operatoire, de la pensee magique vers la pensee probabiliste, de l'identification vers l'objectivation. Les processus conduisent le sujet vers le projet - sublimation du desir ou rationalisation du deuil - par une inscription dans une perspective temporelle consistante et jalonnee, et par l'insertion dans une realite scolaire et sociale. L'orientation est ici consideree comme un aspect fondamental de la socialisation de l'adolescent.",

      "title": "Theory for Practice",
      "abstract": "In social work there has always been a tension between practice and theory. At times students and practitioners have protested that it was necessary to forget theory once in practice placements, that it reduced spontaneity in caring for people. Theory implied distance and objectivity which contrasted with feelings and the living reality of social work encounters. As such it was seen to be a stumbling-block to developing individual style, and the most that could be hoped for was that students would admit that they might subconsciously be using theory which they had absorbed during training. In recent years students have become less antagonistic to theoretical ideas, naming and trying to integrate what can at first glance appear to be a smorgasbord of apparently contradictory explanations of behaviour. There is an irony that this acceptance occurs at a time when changes introduced are based on assumptions that social work is a set of functions, and that practitioners need to be trained merely to perform these functions. Education in theories which might underpin decision-making, or which might inform what action to take, is seen as unnecessary. This approach, known as the competence-based approach, was heralded by the introduction of requirements for social work education and training in the Diploma in Social Work Studies, but is reflected in policy implementation which is now controlling much social work activity.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the hidden nature of mental illness in the workplace and the resulting inequities. We examine inequities that may occur when mental illness is known to others and when it is concealed in the workplace. When mental illness is known to others, assumptions about capabilities, dangerousness, validity of mental illness, and the health consequences of work can drive a variety of employment inequities, including unfair or inaccurate hiring decisions, underemployment, inaccurate performance appraisals and judgments about potential, social shunning resulting in weak social networks, fewer resources to deal with discrimination, bullying, and difficulty in obtaining accommodations. When mental illness is concealed, misattributions about behavior and performance, self-stigma, and identity management dynamics can lead to similar inequities. Research in other fields has mainly examined inequities occurring when others know about the mental illness. Furthermore, this research conducted outside the management field does not usually address the more proximal causes and workplace dynamics behind inequities. The purpose of this article is to uncover the multiple routes to workplace inequities facing employees with mental illness and to spur management researchers to devote more research attention to these issues to promote the full inclusion of people with mental illness into the workforce.",

      "title": "Special teams for medical/psychological intervention in disaster victims.",
      "abstract": "A disaster is defined not only by material, but also by psychosocial criteria: a) it causes psychic suffering, b) it brings unhappiness, c) it causes perturbations in the human environment, and d) it strikes the society's functions, such as production-distribution-use of energy and water, circulation of persons and merchandises, etc. Thus, in a disaster, each victim, witness or rescuer, is wounded not only in his/her personal ego, but also in his/her communal ego. Therefore, we must take in consideration not only the individual but also the collective reactions and behaviours. The mental health intervention must be adapted to these distinctions and to the three phases of the disaster psychology: a) the immediate phase (first hours), b) the post-immediate phase (first days, first weeks), and c) the chronic phase (after one month).\r\n\r\nThe immediate reaction to disasters is usually the normal adaptive biophysio- psychological reaction of stress. It is useful, life-saving, focusing attention, mobilizing the mental and physiological capacities and prompting to decision making. But, it is accompanied by disturbing neurovegetative symptoms and, if it is too intense, too long or too repeated, it exhausts the energetic reserves and becomes overwhelming stress, in one of its four modalities: stuporous inhibition, uncontrolled agitation, individual panic flight, and automatic behaviour (acting by reflex or blind imitation, without consciousness or recall of the action). In predisposed individuals, we can also observe neurotic (anxious or hysterical) or psychotic (confusional, manic, delusional or schizophreniclike) reactions (1).\r\n\r\nThe post-immediate reaction can be the progressive extinction of stress symptoms, or a short-delayed emotional or neurovegetative reaction, or the variable persistence of neurotic or psychotic states. But it can be also the beginning (latency period) of a durable or chronic psychotraumatic syndrome, the so-called 'post-traumatic stress disorder' (PTSD). The latency period is not completely silent clinically: we can observe perplexity, sadness, abnormal euphoria, and insomnia.\r\n\r\nThe psychotraumatic syndrome is well known to clinicians. It covers a large range of cases, more or less severe and durable, corresponding to complete PTSD or elements of PTSD, and associate anxious, depressive, psychosomatic or personality pathology. Its main symptoms are the reviviscences of the event, the increased arousal and alertness, with insomnia, the avoidance of everything that recalls the trauma, and withdrawal from the world and from others (2). The ICD-10 has introduced the category of 'modifications of personality after an experience of catastrophe', emphasizing the marked change of the whole victim's personality.\r\n\r\nCollective behaviour is different from the arithmetic sum of the individual behaviours which seem to compose it. It depends on the collective mind of the people, and eventually on the collective soul of the crowd, and it has its own psychological characteristics. Collective behaviours can be adjusted or maladjusted (1). Adjusted behaviours accomplish learned adaptive actions: evacuating in order, helping others, etc. They are characterized by three aspects: a) group structure is maintained, b) leadership is maintained, and c) mutual help is offered. Maladjusted behaviours include collective stupor (people remain without initiative or evacuate the damaged zone in a slow centrifugal stuporous exodus), collective panic (distracted flight, pitilessly overthrowing and trampling all that obstructs it) (3), discharge of violence, identifying scapegoats, and regressive desire of being perpetually assisted (4). Maladjusted behaviours are characterized by three elements: a) group structure is destroyed, b) leadership disappears, and c) crowd mentality prevails, without solidarity.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate phase (first hours), the early, immediate, mental health intervention is a moral obligation. Experience shows that victims who receive an early medical/psychological help have less severe sequelae. The mental health intervention must include: a) medical/psychological care provided by medical specialized teams, and b) psychological support provided by psychologists and mental health personnel (helped by para-professional workers). In France, the official network of the 'medico-psychological emergency cells' provides immediate intervention on the ground, with teams (psychiatrists, psychologists and nurses) integrated into the network of the medical emergency teams. Their mission is: a) to give care to mentally wounded people and to treat the disturbing symptoms of stress, b) to ensure the triage and the evacuation of the above people (5). They work in close collaboration with teams of psychosocial support, who provide help to the other victims. In this immediate phase, care includes not only the administration of anxiolytic or antidepressant medication, but mainly listening to the victims expressing their stress or trauma experience, and providing information about the reactions, the symptoms and their evolution. This early medical/psychological care and support is called 'defusing'.\r\n\r\nIn the post-immediate period, not only the medical/psychological follow- up of the hospitalized victims must be assured, but 'debriefing' (individual or in groups) must be proposed to victims and rescuers who need it. Experience shows that debriefing for rescuers must be conducted according to cognitive and narrative principles, while debriefing for victims must be based on the expression of emotions (cathartic method) (2).\r\n\r\nIn the chronic phase, the treatment of PTSD (complete or incomplete) and associated pathology (often misdiagnosed) must be ensured as soon as possible, because any delay facilitates the development of the morbid process. This treatment must be provided in a special setting (different from the ordinary psychiatric settings, because the victim of disaster does not consider himself/herself as a psychiatric patient), by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists specially trained in PTSD and disaster psychiatry.\r\n\r\nCollective panic is difficult to deal with, and requires public order measures taken by the authorities. Other collective maladjusted behaviours (collective inhibition, collective dependence, scapegoating phenomena) require the intervention of mental health personnel. The help of paramedical personnel and institutions will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nPrevention can be provided in the warning phase (giving exact information on the upcoming disaster and instructions on the appropriate reactions), but it is better to ensure longterm prevention. Long-term prevention, in countries frequently struck by natural disasters, includes four phases: a) information (on the risks and dangers), b) moral education (mutual help and solidarity), c) instructions (about means of protection and rescue) and d) training in exercises. Education of rescuers and leaders must be made available, dealing not only with the stress of the victims and its effects, but also with the stress of rescuers: how to recognize it and cope with it.",

A social cognitive perspective on self-regulation is presented. In this view students' academic competence develops initially from social sources of academic skills and subsequently shifts to self-sources in a series of four levels: observational, imitative, self-controlled, and self-regulated. The effects of models on observers depend in part on perceptions of self-efficacy, or personal beliefs about one's capabilities to learn or perform behaviors at designated levels. Research is reviewed on cognitive modeling, coping and mastery models, and self-modeling. Implications for educational practice are discussed. Contains 31 references. (Contains 31 references.)

The current paper seeks to provide a theoretical and clinical understanding of procrastination by reviewing prior research. Based on previous studies, here, the present review interprets effects of personality traits (like conscientiousness and neuroticism), aversiveness of tasks and negative emotions on procrastination. Furthermore, we suggest that making proper plan and emotion regulation strategies could attenuate procrastination. For investigating psychological mechanism of procrastination further, specific experiment design and neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and fNIRs, should be engaged in future research.",

      "abstract": "Activities in the learning require students to communicate, collaborate, create material, and review each other´s work in their group. Working in a group can be very challenging for some people because of dominant behavior disruption group dynamics. In this study, social dominance and particularly “the know-it-all” who acts knowledgeable and who dismisses the opinions, comments, or suggestions of others, is discussed and how resulting problems effects the group dynamic. A case study about a dominant “know-it-all” student in a laboratory practical class group work is described in the report. Different groups were compared and the general disruptive effects were indicated on know-it-all in group dynamics. Results show that dominant individuals consistently attained high levels of influence to other group members, and controlled the group with a low tolerance for correction and contradiction. The other group members’ work can be misinterpreted as free-riders if agreeing to everything with the know-it-all’s suggestions without proper discussion and participation. The achievement of the intended learning outcomes when the group dynamics are disrupted can be severely affected, diminishing the knowledge transfer between teacher-student. The cultural background, learning environment and first experiences in the career can have a huge impact on the way that that each individual deal with group dynamics. The report presents solutions from a teacher’s perspective to the two different categories of the know-it-all: The true know-it-all and the think-they-know-it-all. In the former example the teacher can talk individually with the person acknowledging the student´s deep knowledge but explaining how the other students are effected. In the latter example the teacher´s role is monitoring the students learning by asking questions and if students feels oppressed or personally offended by the know-it-all engage in a circular response discussion.",

      "abstract": "The study is dedicated to identifying the impact of uncertainty stress on the psychological health and subjective well-being of an individual. The concept of “psychological health” is interpreted by the authors as a certain type of well-being, in which a person perceives his life as full of meaning, has enough mental strength and desire for moving forward, personal growth and carries out purposeful activities in accordance with his(her) goals and values. Psychological well-being is considered as a key element of mental and psychological health of a person, as well as a criterion of the life quality. The situation of uncertainty which is becoming more and more inherent in modern society occurs due to the rapid growth of the variety of changes taking place in it. Social instability is reflected in a person’s consciousness and leads to a feeling of uncertainty about the future, fears and anxieties. The situation of uncertainty places increased demands on a person’s activity and can potentially affect his(her) normal functioning, acting as a powerful stressor that negatively affects physical, mental and psychological health. The research hypothesis was put forward that experiencing the stress of uncertainty has a negative effect on the psychological health indicators of the individual and the level of his subjective well-being. An empirical study was conducted with the participation of 316 respondents – students and cadets. Three psychological tests were used: 1. E. Diner’s Satisfaction With Life Scale; 2. Test “Individual model of psychological health” by O.V. Kozlov; 3. USS-10 (10-item Chinese Uncertainty Stress Scale). The results of the conducted empirical research showed the negative impact of the situation of uncertainty on the level of subjective well-being of the individual, as well as such components of his(her) psychological health as goal setting, self-confidence, the desire for intellectual development, orientation towards social interaction, which testifies to the confirmation of the proposed hypothesis. Key words: psychological health, psychological well-being, uncertainty, uncertainty stress, life satisfaction.",

Modern conceptions of the mind make a distinction between deliberate, intentional, or explicit thoughts and feelings, and automatic, unintentional or implicit thoughts and feelings [2]. The theoretical distinction is advanced with a proliferation of measurement methods that assess social constructs (attitudes, stereotypes, and identity) without requiring an act of introspection or self-knowledge. The Implicit Association Test [4, 10] is a popular method, in part, because it is adaptable for many research applications, relatively reliable as a measure of associative strength, elicits strong effects, reveals evaluations that are distinct but related to self-report [11], and shows predictive validity of judgment and behavior across a variety of topics [5].

This measure is computed from performance speeds at two classification tasks in which association strengths influence performance. The apparent usefulness of the IAT may be due to its combination of apparent resistance to self-presentation artifact, its lack of dependence on introspective access to the association strengths being measured [6], and its ease of adaptation to assess a broad variety of socially significant associations. A computer-based measure, the IAT requires that users rapidly categorize two target concepts with an attribute (e.g. the concepts male and female with the attribute logical), such that easier pairings (faster responses) are interpreted as more strongly associated in memory than more difficult pairings (slower responses) [7]. The IAT is thought to measure implicit attitudes: introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects [5]. In research, the IAT has been used to develop theories to understand implicit cognition (i.e. cognitive processes of which a person has no conscious awareness). These processes may include memory, perception, attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes. Because the IAT requires that users make a series of rapid judgments, researchers believe that IAT scores may also reflect attitudes which people are unwilling to reveal publicly [7].The IAT may allow researchers to get around the difficult problem of social desirability bias and for that reason it has been used extensively to assess people's attitudes towards commonly stigmatized groups [3]. The IAT’s measure, often referred to as the IAT effect, is based on latencies for two tasks that differ in instructions for using two response keys to classify four categories of stimuli. Table 1 describes the seven steps (blocks) of a typical IAT procedure. THE INFLUENCE OF MOOD ON THE IMPLICIT SELF-APPRAISAL",

However, when a facilitator or participant practices stopping the action and calling out these behaviors, there is a danger that they will go beyond productive tension into a level that causes casualties.

Creative thinking is interpreted as a profes-sionally-oriented thinking characterized by the ability to generate a lot of original ideas in unregu-lated conditions of activity, developed verbal creativity and insight, a high level of reflection, in-quisitiveness, imagination, self-control of emotional states. We consider it as the most important factor influencing personal and professional self-change of students – future psychologists. We re-veal the indicators of creative thinking development and the diagnostic tools for their evaluation are substantiated, identify and analyze the main problem areas in the development of creative thinking of students (low level of verbal activity, lack of curiosity, lack of understanding of the need for further work on the development of imagination). Using diagnosis we reveal the relation-ship between the individual psychological characteristics of the personality of students-psychologists and their predominant types of thinking: subject, symbolic, symbolic and imagina-tive. We obtain the analysis results using a five-factor personal questionnaire by R. McCrae and P. Costa which allows to make a personal portrait of the subjects by many factors: extra – version – introversion, attachment – isolation, self-control – impulsiveness, emotional stability-instability, expressiveness-practicality. We reveal the difficulties in the development of creative thinking, which meet students with a focus on the prevalence of one of the indicators in a particular pair. We present the factor analysis results of the obtained data carried out by principal component analysis with the construction of the correlation matrix and subsequent orthogonal rotation. Correlation analysis showed that the students' scale of creativity correlates with such indicators as imagination, creative thinking, activity – passivity, domination – submission, manifestation – avoidance of guilt, extroversion – introversion, credulity – suspicion, curiosity – conservatism, curiosity – realism, activity component. The results of the study can be used in the educational programs development aimed at the students’ creativity development and personal and professional competencies formation of future psychologists in high school.",

      "abstract": "Informed consent has problems with readability, length, complexity, and so on. On the one hand, rigid requirements related to informed consent discourage subjects to participate experiment. On the other hand, it distracts from more serious ethical problems in clinical research such as decision-making capacity. Recently, there is increasing evidence that some proportion of the population has difficulties with decision-making capacity. Therefore, the neuropsychological tests associated with decision making are needed before giving valid informed consent. The decision making related to informed consent can be described by the interplay between emotional and cognitive functions. How can we investigate this empirically? An appropriate scale measuring neuropsychological function in informed consent should include both cognitive and emotional abilities. Nowadays, the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool(MacCAT) was widely used. But it relies predominantly on cognitive abilities such as understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expression of choice. Considering recent empirical studies, the inclusion of emotional abilities in relation to decision-making seems to be essential. Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) requires emotional function as well as cognitive function to perform proper decision-making. Thus, it would be necessary to administer both the MacCAT and the IGT in people who have deficits in decision making and in giving valid or invalid informed consent.",

      "abstract": "In historical aspect, the skill is among the key categories in the realm of human practice, which are often an object of different researches – psychological, pedagogical, and last but not least methodological. This is a fact, because the skill is a vital term for the description of productivity of learning experience at least in two dimensions – personally fundamental, guaranteeing its effective functioning in different situations and personally pragmatic, as a multi-level transformation of the cognitive experience, for the completion of certain social roles and the necessary qualities of the subject for this. The skill is a blend between those two dimensions of productivity both in higher education and in secondary school. The reflective skills are a structural and functional part of the transformation of the cognitive, affective, and psycho-motor experience and as such are included in the individual educational reality of the subject, and to a higher degree it defines it. This is the reason why the constructive-prognostic analysis of the reflective skill in the area of Methodology is pointing at the answer of the questions: What is this, what is its structure, how does it get integrated in the system of skills, how does it form and develop. The answers of those questions are basis of its methodological decoding in the process of training teachers and students in Biology. All of this describes the territory of the methodological context of analysing the reflective skill.",

An alternative approach is that there is some useful plasticity or ability to relearn at all ages even though they may differ quantitatively and/or qualitatively.",

      "abstract": "When making decisions, people typically gather information from both social and nonsocial sources, such as advice from others and direct experience. This research adapted a cognitive learning paradigm to examine the process by which people learn what sources of information are credible. When participants relied on advice alone to make decisions, their learning of source reliability proceeded in a manner analogous to traditional cue learning processes and replicated the established learning phenomena. However, when advice and nonsocial cues were encountered together as an established phenomenon, blocking (ignoring redundant information) did not occur. Our results suggest that extant cognitive learning models can accommodate either advice or nonsocial cues in isolation. However, the combination of advice and nonsocial cues (a context more typically encountered in daily life) leads to different patterns of learning, in which mutually supportive information from different types of sources is not regarded as redundant and may be particularly compelling. For these situations, cognitive learning models still constitute a promising explanatory tool but one that must be expanded. As such, these findings have important implications for social psychological theory and for cognitive models of learning.",

The theoretical analysis of the problem made it possible to determine that the activation of psychological protection is caused by a situation of conflict, trauma, stress, its purpose is to reduce emotional tension, prevent disorganization of behavior, consciousness, psyche. All defense mechanisms have two general characteristics: they operate at an unconscious level and are therefore means of self-deception; they distort, deny, transform, or falsify perceptions of reality to make the anxiety less threatening to the individual. Self-actualization is defined as the process of self-development of the individual, the transformation of a person into a subject of his own life activity. It is inseparable from the process of reflection, which accompanies all components of personal growth: self-understanding, self-sympathy, values, meanings, etc. The success of a specialist, in addition to special knowledge, abilities, skills, is related to personal characteristics, the desire for self-development, self-actualization. Establishing himself in the profession, the individual achieves self-actualization. The results of the study showed that the prevailing mechanisms of psychological protection among students of higher education are: projection, compensation and denial. Among the parameters of a self-actualizing personality, the following are expressed: contact, autosympathy, orientation in time; pronounced self-actualization tendencies: orientation in time, self-respect, self-acceptance, acceptance of aggression, contact. Among the types of psychological defenses that have the greatest influence on the process of self-actualization of the individual, substitution and projection are highlighted. Key words: psychological protection, self-actualization, student of higher education.",

      "abstract": "Background: Awareness can be defined as a reasonable or realistic perception or appraisal of a given aspect of one's situation, functioning or performance, or of the resulting implications, expressed explicitly or implicitly. Disturbances of awareness have significant implications for people with dementia and their caregivers. The construction of awareness has been extensively studied in dementia, but a lack of conceptual and methodological clarity in this area means that few clear findings have emerged. Aims: This article presents a framework for conceptualizing awareness in people with Alzheimer's disease and associated dementias that can guide research and influence practice. Overview: This article begins by considering the general concept of awareness and the ways in which neurological damage can place constraints on awareness. Within an integrative biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the influence of neurocognitive, psychological, and social variables on awareness, challenges for empirical research on awareness in dementia are addressed, and a 'levels of awareness' framework is presented within which awareness operates at four levels of increasing complexity, providing a means of differentiating among awareness phenomena. Approaches to mapping awareness phenomena are discussed, and directions for future research and clinical practice are outlined. Conclusions: The levels of awareness framework should act as a stimulus to further research in this area, resulting in a more coherent understanding of the nature of awareness deficits, the implications of these for people with dementia and their caregivers, and the possibilities for targeted and effective interventions.",

      "title": "To become or be made a psychoanalyst",
      "abstract": "Psychoanalysis is unique in that competence in the field can be achieved only through applying the method to oneself. Different psychoanalytic schools differ in their understanding of the unconscious, about how to approach it, or how to define the specificity of the psychoanalytic interaction. Consequently, there are differences in the criteria for the definition of the ‘good-enough analysis’. There are many different opinions about how to select candidates, organise the curriculum and length of training. To define psychoanalytic talent is difficult; the uncertainty in the definition of criteria to use for selection is great; the problematic overlap between personal analysis and training is constantly present; to achieve conditions in which learning and creativity can develop is complicated by trainee, supervisor and their relationship to the Institute. Confrontations about training are often heated and divergent, as well as repetitive. Systematic studies about psychoanalytic education are very few. After a short discussion of the different concerns about selection, personal versus training analysis and the ambiguities of the supervisory situation, the author gives a review of three studies on how psychoanalytic education—as viewed by trainers and trainees—is conducted and experienced at the Swedish Psychoanalytic Institute. Training is felt to be well grounded in theory and tradition; nonetheless most do not have a sufficiently clear picture of training as a whole. Both candidates and trainers see the development of a psychoanalytic identity as the goal of training, where the competencies to be acquired are equated with important personality qualities. The candidates have a feeling of “being chosen\"; they “wish to belong to a group who share an interest and fascination for psychoanalytic thinking and theory\". All praise the warm and open atmosphere, and the mutual and continuous evaluations and the deep involvement of all. The surge to be rooted in an overreaching psychoanalytic ethic, the culture of gratitude within the Institute and the devotion to the task to train psychoanalytic clinicians for the future may preserve an idealised image of psychoanalysis and the fantasy that psychoanalysts are exceptional persons and give a mystifying colour to the psychoanalytic profession. This might also stand in the way of a more radical change in the traditions of training—according to the rather drastically changing climate in which psychoanalysts of the future will have to work.",

      "title": "Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency.",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the centrality of the self-efficacy mechanism in human agency. Self-per- cepts of efficacy influence thought patterns, actions, and emotional arousal. In causal tests the higher the level of induced self-efficacy, the higher the perfor- mance accomplishments and the lower the emotional arousal. Different lines of research are reviewed, show- ing that the self-efficacy mechanism may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to ac- count for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pur- suits. The influential role of perceived collective effi- cacy in social change is analyzed, as are the social con- ditions conducive to development of collective inefficacy. Psychological theorizing and research tend to cen- ter on issues concerning either acquisition of knowledge or execution of response patterns. As a result the processes governing the interrelation- ship between knowledge and action have been largely neglected (Newell, 1978). Some of the re- cent efforts to bridge this gap have been directed at the biomechanics problem—how efferent com- mands of action plans guide the production of ap- propriate response patterns (Stelmach, 1976,1978). Others have approached the matter in terms of algorithmic knowledge, which furnishes guides for executing action sequences (Greeno, 1973; Newell, 1973). ,",

      "abstract": "The application of neuroscience to educational research remains an area of much debate. While some scholars have argued that such applications are not possible (and will never be possible), others have been more optimistic and suggest that these are possible, albeit under certain conditions, for example when one aims to understand very basic cognitive processes. Concrete examples of these applications are increasing in the emerging interdisciplinary field of mind, brain, and education or educational neuroscience, which posits itself at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and educational research. From a methodological point of view, cognitive neuroscience can be applied to (some types of) educational research, as it offers a toolbox to investigate specific types of educational research questions. Promising applications of cognitive neuroscience to educational research include comprehending the origins of atypical development, understanding the biological processes that play a role when learning school-relevant skills, predicting educational outcomes, generating predictions to be tested in educational research, and undertaking biological interventions. The challenges of applying cognitive neuroscience deal with ecological validity, the scope of a biological explanation, and the potential emergence of neuromyths.",

Modern society is characterized by a large number of emergencies or situations, under the influence of which a person activates special mechanisms that help not only adapt in society, but also adapt to any situation that has arisen, often a conflict-gene. One of the internal resources that allows a person to overcome difficult, stressful situations in modern society is the volitional sphere of the personality.&#x0D; It seems that the study of the volitional sphere of convicts can become the basis for psychological support of convicts to imprisonment at all stages of serving their sentences, contribute to the development and implementation of effective programs to prepare for parole.&#x0D; The purpose of the study was to study the features of the volitional sphere of convicts preparing for parole.&#x0D; According to the results of the study, it was possible to establish that convicts preparing for parole, serving sentences in a strict regime colony to a greater extent, are characterized by a superficial attitude to affairs, a tendency to take thoughtless risks, weak volitional processes, unwillingness to apply physical and mental efforts, emotional instability and severe anxiety, which probably increases the likelihood of committing repeated crimes.&#x0D; At the same time, convicts preparing for parole, serving sentences in a settlement colony, are largely characterized by the ability to control their emotions and show initiative and perseverance when making a responsible decision. It seems that, to a sufficient degree, self-confidence frees from the fear of the unknown, increases the readiness to accept the new, the unexpected, and, as a rule, is combined with freedom of opinion, a tendency to innovation.",

      "abstract": "In order to perform at the highest level in educational settings (e.g., students in testing situations), individuals often have to control their impulses or desires (e.g., to study for an upcoming test or to prepare a course instead of spending time with the peer group). Previous research suggests that the ability to exert self-control is an important predictor of performance and behavior in educational contexts. According to the strength model, all self-control acts are based on one global energy pool whose capacity is assumed to be limited. After having performed a first act of self-control, this resource can become temporarily depleted which negatively affects subsequent self-control. In such a state of ego depletion, individuals tend to display impaired concentration and academic performance, fail to meet academic deadlines, or even disengage from their duties. In this mini-review, we report recent studies on ego depletion which have focused on children as well as adults in educational settings, derive practical implications for how to improve self-control strength in the realm of education and instruction, and discuss limitations regarding the assumptions of the strength model of self-control.",

      "abstract": "Difficult life situations shift the emphasis from creativity to adaptation, create a threat of giftedness wasting. Gifted individuals struggle with these situations using personal resources conceptualized as psychological resilience, hardiness, ability to recover, ego strength, self-efficacy, coping strategies, assertiveness. The first three concepts are descriptive and partially overlapping, but they do not reveal the ultimate sources and mechanisms of gifted people’s adverse life situations surviving. Ego strength, self-efficacy, productive coping strategies, assertiveness are intrinsically connected with the giftedness psychological structure and personality dynamics what developed by such people to overcome obstacles in realizing their potential. There is complex relationship between assertiveness and giftedness. Communicative assertiveness can be considered as a tool for gifted people to promote their achievements, to ensure social recognition of the creative activity products. In other case insufficient assertiveness prevents recognition, does not allow a person to be considered as a realized gifted. It is possible what communicative assertiveness have unequal weight in giftedness different types. It may be that assertiveness is more deeply or somewhat in other forms integrated into the psychological structure of social and athletic giftedness. Another facet of assertiveness – life assertiveness what maintains one’s own value regulation of activity and social interaction in which giftedness and talent manifest, develop, and gain recognition. In this way, assertiveness allows not to mask giftedness, not to stop its development.",

      "abstract": "In a wide variety of cognitive tasks, people's expectations of what their own performance is, was, and will be are an overestimate of reality. After documenting a number of situations in which people exhibit such overconfidence, several reasons for it are discussed. It is suggested that in these situations, the optimistic bias is not attributable exclusively to self-deception or wishful thinking. Rather, the information yielded up by the cognitive system, in combination with the heuristics used for making judgments of future and past performance tailored to the specific questions asked of participants, produces a bias toward believing that one knows, knew, and will perform better than actual performance substantiates. Consequently, in the cognitive domain, the inflated beliefs that result in overconfidence also result in cessation of efforts before the correct solution of problems is ascertained, before accurate retrieval of memorial information is attained, or before adequate learning of new material has been accomplished. This effect seems in contrast to findings on people's moods and self-esteem in real-world or threatening situations that suggest that an optimistic bias in these domains be person protective and adaptive.",

      "title": "An Interactional Study of Locale, Gender and Defence Mechanism on Self Expression of High School Students",
      "abstract": "Mechanisms are learned responses, which develop unconsciously and also, are used unconsciously to meet a stressful situation. Usually during a period of stress, there is a threat to the ego or self concept of the individual. The Defence mechanism helps the individual to preserve his or her self concept and to protect him or herself from anxiety. Almost each one of us makes use of these mechanisms to a certain extent. The teacher should therefore try to understand the needs served by the use of defence mechanism and the precautions to be taken in case of their expressive use. Defence mechanisms are prevalent in our lives. They are generated by conflicts in our social or family relationships, by existential problems in our evolution towards maturity, and by academic or professional setbacks. Our worries, lack of self-confidence or confidence in others, and feelings of guilt and personal inadequacy are among the main indicators of the use of defence mechanisms. Identifying and measuring defence mechanisms are important elements in psychotherapy for dealing with personality disorders. The expression of defence mechanisms reflects the hypotheses that they obnubilate significant problems.Psychoanalysis (Freud, 1937) have tried to explain the several defence mechanism that form in the course of our development to deal with conflicting impulses and inner tensions. They are not pathological in themselves . They absolutely essential for normal living. In some cases, the use of these mechanisms may promote the mental health of the individual. Glaser and sacks ( 1973) reported that person tend to be fairly consistent in the specific use of defence mechanism. Though these mechanism may serum the purpose of alleviating anxietyand proceeding the self. They may usually in value some measure of self deception and reality distortion, and are thus maladaptive.In recent years there has been tremendous increase in researches on deprived children in India to find out the ways and means to ameliorate their lot. In a host of studies conducted in the field of deprivation. The consistent finding was that deprived child is likely to be deficient in the various aspect of his cognitive motivational and personality development. In an effort to search for the mechanism through which deprivation exerts its influence on the development of the child. Sangit tickoo(2004) studied the sense of deprivation and mental health among school students. The present investigation was undertaking to study the relationship between sense of deprivation and mental health were found significant relationship between sense of deprivation and mental health indicated that sense of deprivation deteriorates mental health. Cultural emphasis on an independent itself or an interdependent self can influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviors' (Cross & Markus, 1999).Self Expression is so called in order to mark out my subject matter from those phenomena in which words express ideas or concepts, and sentences express propositions. I take that relation to be a matter of human convention and thus no more in need of explanation than other ways in which we institute linguistic conventions. My focus is instead the various ways in which we express ourselves that may but need not depend on conventions.Objective of the studyTo find out the main andlnteractional effect of defence mechanism and background variables locale (2), gender (2) on self expression of high school students.Hypothesis of the studyH1-The scores on self expression will be no significantly interacted by locale, gender and defence mechanism for high school students.MethodPopulation- The population for the study was taken from all the high schools of Chhattisgarh coming district Raipur.ParticipantsThe sample for the study was drawn through simple random sampling technique.

      "title": "LEADERSHIP IN TIMES OF CRISIS",
      "abstract": "Leadership encircles the capability of an individual, group or organization to guide others (individuals, teams, or whole organizations). True leadership requires a personality that attracts other people, constant development of relationships with team members, possessing professional and practical knowledge and skills, experience, self-confidence, intuition and empathy. Strong leaders continuously empower other people, because they believe in their team members. Leadership skills are continuosly learned and improved not only during professional development, but throughout person’s life. Crises are inevitable events, that occur sooner or later in all the organizations. They can be triggered by different internal or external factors. Each crisis is specific and unique and requires different approaches for finding solutions. When a crisis occurs, ignoring or avoiding it, is one of the biggest mistakes for the organization. It should be accepted, resolved and used to initiate change, which is necessary for organzations’ survival and further development and growth. Having an organized, planned and structured approach to crisis management can help in damage reduction, restraing the company losses and discover inventive mechanisms to maintain the workforce’s productivity. Crisis leadership is a process that resolves the unforseeable events that happen unexpectedly and have the ability to diminish the organizational structure, to cease growth and development and lead to catastrophic outcomes. Whether the crisis will be successfully resolved, depends on how the leadership will deal with the situation. A positive approach to crisis is to accept it as an opportunity, to take responsibility, manifest confidence and implement changes which will streghtehen the organization and empower the employess to perform better and become stonger people in future. If leaders are bold and act, if they are decisive and willing to adapt their decision to the occurring conditions, they are going to have more success in resolving the crisis, compared to leaders that choose to wait and not take any action. Leadership is a vital process at all times, but when a crisis strikes, a strong leader has cardinal importance for the organization.",

      "abstract": "The term “executive function” includes a series of independent cognitive processes\r\nwhich work together to resolve new tasks. This requires complex cognitive processes. It's\r\nagreed that there is a relationship between these functions and the frontal lobe, especially\r\nthe prefrontal cortex. Studies about injuries in this part of the brain show consequences in\r\nthe control, organisation or coordination of cognitive functions, and disruptive emotional\r\nand social behaviour. These alterations of the frontal lobe, known as “Disexecutive\r\nSyndrome”can lead to disfunctional cognitve processes such as attention or memory,\r\nwhich are necessary for the executive functions of the brain. The executive development\r\nhas periods of growth throughout life. The ideal stage to require the above functions is\r\nbetween the ages of 7 and 11. The complexity of the term causes a failure of agreement\r\nabout its nature and function and there are a variety of different theories. The need to\r\nreach an agreement is important in the evaluation process and valid and efficient\r\nrehabilitation methods to guarantee a realistic transferible intervention. Nowadays in\r\nclasses, lots of pupils obtain low or moderate executive performance which effects\r\nlearning. Because of this, the following work presents an intervention programme to\r\nimprove the executive functions of 11 to 12 year old pupils. This concentrates on an\r\neducational context and follows a descriptive methodology, not experimental, with\r\nattention and executive functions as neurophsycological variables, and academic\r\nperfomance. This structure is based on results obtained in different tests such as Conners'\r\nscale, Caras -R test and the neurophsycological ENFEN group test, together with\r\nacademic results, so that in time this could be a practical tool for teachers and help in the\r\nlearning process.",

      "title": "Learning in and about complex systems",
      "abstract": "Abstract Change is accelerating, and as the complexity of the systems in which we live grows, so do the unanticipated side effects of human actions, further increasing complexity. Many scholars call for the development of systems thinking to improve our ability to manage wisely. But how do people learn in and about complex dynamic systems? Learning is a feedback process in which our decisions alter the real world, we receive information feedback about the world and revise the decisions we make and the mental models that motivate those decisions. Unfortunately, in the world of social action various impediments slow or prevent these learning feedbacks from functioning, allowing erroneous and harmful behaviors and beliefs to persist. The barriers to learning include the dynamic complexity of the systems themselves; inadequate and ambiguous outcome feedback; systematic mispercep‐tions of feedback; inability to simulate mentally the dynamics of our cognitive maps; poor interpersonal and organizational inquiry skills; and poor scientific reasoning skills. To be successful, methods to enhance learning about complex systems must address all these impediments. Effective methods for learning in and about complex dynamic systems must include (1) tools to elicit participant knowledge, articulate and reframe perceptions, and create maps of the feedback structure of a problem from those perceptions; (2) simulation tools and management flight simulators to assess the dynamics of those maps and test new policies; and (3) methods to improve scientific reasoning skills, strengthen group process, and overcome defensive routines for individuals and teams.",

      "abstract": "Organisational changes have created the need for continuous learning environments and facilitated experiential learning for complex skill acquisition. Experiential learning is the process of acquiring knowledge and skills from challenging situations through focused attention and reflection. For instance, many organisations place employees in challenging or developmental job assignments in the hope that the employee will learn something from the experience and transfer that learning to other situations. Unfortunately, there are many drawbacks to letting people learn complex skills 'in the wild.' Based on established theories of mindfulness and self-regulation, this article proposes an individualised learning approach called Guided Mindfulness to structure and guide experiential learning.",

Les troubles cognitifs et les symptômes cliniques en sont la cause principale. Cependant, la nature de leurs relations avec l’insertion professionnelle reste mal connue. Cet article présente les résultats d’une étude examinant l’influence des fonctions mnésiques et des symptômes négatifs sur 5 composantes du comportement au travail chez 39 personnes schizophrènes en réinsertion professionnelle. Un deuxième volet de l’étude présente une approche de remédiation cognitive « sur mesure » qui cible des objectifs en lien direct avec les difficultés professionnelles et/ou quotidiennes de la personne. Les programmes ont concerné les fonctions mnésiques et le contrôle attentionnel. Les analyses indiquent que la mémoire à long terme verbale exerce une influence sur les capacités de coopération, la qualité du travail et la présentation personnelle. La capacité d’apprentissage d’informations verbales joue un rôle dans les habitudes de travail. La mémoire de travail qui permet le traitement et le maintien de l’information à court terme ne semble pas exercer une influence sur le comportement au travail. Enfin, les symptômes négatifs déterminent en partie les habiletés sociales et la présentation personnelle. Les résultats des interventions cognitives montrent leur efficacité pour compenser les déficits cognitifs dans l’insertion professionnelle et sociale.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThis article presents a perspective on addiction that not only substantiates why group therapy is the treatment of choice for addiction, but also integrates diverse perspectives from 12-step abstinence-based models, self psychology, and attachment theory into a complementary integrative formula. Attachment theory, self psychology, and affect regulation theory characterize addiction as an attachment disorder induced by a person's misguided attempt at self-repair because of deficits in psychic structure. Vulnerability of the self is the consequence of developmental failures and early environmental deprivation leading to ineffective attachment styles. Substance abuse, as a reparative attempt, only exacerbates that condition because of physical dependence and further deterioration of existing physiological and psychological structures. Prolonged stress on existing structures leads to exaggerated difficulty in the regulation of affect, which leads to inadequate modulation of appropriate behavior and self-care and increased character pathology.",

Human behavior emerges from an individual's inherent qualities, encompassing a diverse spectrum of actions and behaviors, especially in their interactions with others. Emotional quotient (EQ) delves into a person's capacity to effectively respond and react within diverse situations involving people. Meanwhile, spiritual quotient (SQ) forms the foundational basis not only for intelligence quotient (IQ) but also for emotional quotient (EQ). The present narrative study delves into how the fusion of emotional and spiritual quotients can empower a leader to make informed and empathetic decisions, consequently propelling the organization towards elevated levels of success.

Mindfulness is developed and supported with a variety of formal and informal practices that foster the ability to sustain attention as well as qualities such as patience, trust, and acceptance which aim for the highest quality of life for helpers and clients alike. In line with this, the purpose of this article is to explore the potential role of mindfulness in helpers’ personal development, specifically toward becoming effective counselors.

One major issue in the continuing argument is the frequent confusion of labels and concepts in the visual field. It is important to view vision as a psychophysiologic mechanism and to differentiate it from a mechanistic orientation emphasizing the eyes. Most visual problems related to learning disability represent a breakdown in the ability of the eyes to function in an harmonious fashion, that is, some interference in binocular function. While visual defects should not be confused with defects in visual perception, the identification and treatment of visual problems is an important element in the diagnosis and remediation of learning disabilities.",

SDT represents an approach to human motivation and personality that uses traditional empirical methods which make clear the importance of development of human innate abilities for personal development, integration and self-regulation. Self-determination theory emphasizes that welfare is an direct function with the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. According to the above mentioned theory self actualization (eudemonia) represents the key aspect of psychological welfare. Namely, SDT aims to explain what it means to actualize oneself and how to schive that. The researches within self-determination theory are focused on the factors that allow or prevent psychological grouth, integrity and welfare. SDT is a theory with great prospect and it allows us not only to understand better the psychological processes in many aspects of use (sport, work, parenthood, education, etc.) but also to direct programs and interventions that improve the circumstances in which people live. The theory has recently been applied in health-working psychology and few empirical findings have given support to its fundamental premises. SDT is a consistant theory that can be tested, it is applicable in almost all spheres of life (family, school system, health care, work, relationships among people ect.) and it gives a broad spectrum of possible problems to research. It not only offers different social environments and his welfare, but the theory also offers directives how to improve the conditions in witch people live and work. The organizational context that allows the possibility to choose, make autonomous decisions, clear explanations of certain work assignments, as well as the appreciation of feelings and attitudes of the employees will bring about greater satisfaction of the innate needs for grouth. It is necessary, in our environment, to emphasize the importance of SDT and its capacity, in other words the possibility of practical implementation of above mentioned concepts and theoretical assumptions.",

      "abstract": "An attempt has been made in this paper to single out the cognitive and mental signs of emotional intelligence and their functions in this process. It has been shown that a significant part of specialists, despite the declarative correspondence of this phenomenon to the sphere of emotions and intelligence, analyzes the social intelligence as the subject of its study and its communicative signs, emotional maturity and its components, self-regulation, empathy, expressiveness of emotions, etc. It can be assumed that in this case, the signs of emotional intelligence are replaced by those that relate to the subject of the study of other psychological phenomena. It should be also agreed that all mental phenomena are closely related, especially since emotions are actually integrated into every process. But when the emotional intelligence is chosen as a subject of study, then this should refer to those signs which should be more reflected certain specific features of emotions in the intelligence. It has been proposed to consider emotional intelligence as a psychological property of individual, characterized by the manifestation of complex as though integrated, emotionalcognitive and mental features, due to which it achieves its goal in certain tasks/problems solving in different activities. It can be argued that emotions are more integrated with cognitive activity in emotional intelligence, and intelligence – with mental activity. That is, the features of the functioning of basic (simple) emotions in higher cognitive, integrated with mental activity are probably what can characterize the psychological essence of the content of emotional intelligence. Such higher emotional and cognitive features that accompany this process include surprise, curiosity, inquisitiveness, interest, enthusiasm, inspiration, guess, disappointment, doubt, insight experience, eureka, and others. The manifestation of these signs may be accompanied by certain functions at the level of comfort emotional coloring of the problem-solving process, emotional guidance on how to solve the problem, emotional activation in the form of strengthening or weakening the manifestation of this process, emotional regulation as dynamics of change of movement of the signs in the problemsolving process. A complex of three methods has been created: investigation of signs of emotional intelligence; study of the manifestation of simple emotions in the content of higher emotions attributed to the signs of emotional intelligence; study of the selected functions of signs of emotional intelligence. It has been shown that there is a certain tendency in the manifestation of signs of emotional intelligence, and its integral components of simple emotions in the problem-solving process. It has been revealed that the emotionally positive orientation of the content of such signs of emotional intelligence as curiosity, insight experience, eureka, their connection with joy and comfort functions of emotional guidance, emotional activation and regulation, form the first complex of emotional intelligence. The second complex is formed on the basis of such signs of emotional intelligence as inquisitiveness, guess and doubt. The third one includes curiosity, enthusiasm and disappointment. These complexes can be those specific determinants of the manifestation of emotional intelligence, as well as the psychological characteristics of its typical manifestations in humans.",

The absence of a single “test” for estimating mental health domains like aggression, anxiety, personality, or parenting requires researchers to assess these domains in many ways. This practice commonly produces discrepant results in assessment outcomes, such that no two ways for assessing a domain produce results that are interchangeable with one another. To support this point, this chapter traces the history of empirical work focused on estimating the level of discrepant results in mental health assessments to its origins in the 1950s. Over time, this literature has grown to hundreds of studies. Authoritative meta-analytic reviews of this literature indicate that discrepant results appear in studies ranging from the prevalence of mental health concerns to the effects of interventions designed to address these concerns.",

      "title": "Can sensory integration have a role in multi‐element behavioural intervention? An evaluation of factors associated with the management of challenging behaviour in community adult learning disability services",
      "abstract": "Accessible summary Sensory integration is about how our brain receives and processes information so we can make sense of our everyday life. Behavioural interventions is a term used to describe how to teach people to increase useful behaviours or decrease behaviours that are challenging. Some people with severe learning disabilities can have behaviour that challenges and this can be difficult to manage. To manage behaviours that challenge restrictive interventions have been used such as people being given medication, or being held by others against their will. Instead of using these restrictive interventions we can use sensory strategies and a low stimulus environment which have been found to be successful in managing behaviours that challenge. Abstract Introduction Adults with complex needs and severe learning disability present as a serious management problem within the community. Restrictive interventions are often used to manage adults with these issues, even though best practice recommends the use of positive behaviour support. Positive behaviour support involves functional analysis, but it does not specifically focus on sensory integration difficulties as a contributing factor to challenging behaviour. Methods A systematic search of the literature was completed using a range of electronic databases, an electronic search, hand search and review of reference lists. Seven relevant studies were identified. These studies were critically appraised and analysed. However, the extent of research was limited and the procedural quality variable, some distinct themes, arose. Results Out of the seven intervention studies included in this review, two studies used sensory integration therapy, three employed multi‐element behavioural intervention, one utilised environmental stimulation within a multifactor behavioural intervention approach and one used sensory strategies within a structured behavioural intervention programme. The participants across the final seven papers reviewed consisted mainly of males with a high incidence of participants presenting with ASD. A range of assessment tools and outcome measures were used. Conclusions The use of restrictive intervention is still an issue in practice. Nearly all the studies reviewed stressed the issue of placing individuals with severe challenging behaviour in the community. Behavioural studies have successfully utilised sensory integration strategies within a structured behavioural format to manage challenging behaviour in a community setting for adults with a learning disability.",

      "abstract": "Communication plays an important role nowadays. The transmission and interchange of ideas, facts, and feelings of action are known as communication. It is done through words, actions, signs, objects or combination of all these. Communication skills are needed in each and every field of life. Everyone uses a language to communicate and to express oneself to get ideas and to connect with persons for a purpose. There are four basic skills of learning English language such as speaking, listening, reading and writing. The difficulties in speaking and writing can be found and then improved by some classroom activities by the way of giving task to the students for listening. Teachers give assignments to the learners to develop their writing skills. Cognition refers to the mental activities like thinking, remembering, memory, learning, comprehension, perception, motivation and using a language. The understanding and learning of information and concept is known as the cognitive approach. It is an approach that maintains how a person feels and behaves. Cognitive learning is about developing true understanding and is a way of learning that helps the learners to use their brains more effectively. The configuration of thought processes and psychological activities like problem solving and decision making from early childhood to adulthood is called as the cognitive development. This article deals with the ways and means of enhancing the speaking skills by intensive practise, writing through different activities and improving the receptive skills of the learners through cognitive approach.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health Care",
      "abstract": "Mental health is one of the most important yet often overlooked aspects of our well-being. Due to the shortage of mental health specialists and the rising incidence of mental health problems, many people have difficulty getting the mental health care they require. Hence, there is a growing need for more effective, affordable, and accessible forms of mental health support. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. This technology is changing how we think about mental health and offers new hope to those struggling. In this article, we will explore AI's application, challenges, and future concerns in mental health. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? According to the English Oxford Living Dictionary, AI is \"The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\"[1] There are two types of AI. (i) Narrow (Weak) AI can perform only a limited set of predetermined functions, e.g. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa. (ii) General (Strong) AI is considered to match the human mind's capacity for independent thought because of its capability to process a wide range of inputs.[2] In 1950, Alan Turing introduced the Turing test to determine if a computer could demonstrate the same intelligence as a human. In 1956, John McCarthy coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College.[3] Since then, scientists have been trying to develop AI models that can be applied to many sectors and industries, such as automotive, finance, and health care. The most common AI-based technologies used in health care include chatbots, virtual reality therapy, and machine learning algorithms. APPLICATION IN MENTAL HEALTHCARE Screening AI helps in understanding mental illness,[4] and it is used for the screening of severe mental illness[5] with clinical magnetic resonance imaging scans,[6] bipolar disorder,[5] depression in old age[4,7] Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[5] AI can examine data from various sources, including social media, to find patterns of activity that might be related to mental health problems. This data helps to identify the high-risk individuals;[8] predict depressive relapses of bipolar disorder.[9] However, recent studies found that AI models have variable performance in diagnosing mental illness.[8] Therapies Patients can now receive cognitive behavioral therapy treatment from AI-powered virtual therapists such as Woebot.[10] Patients can communicate with these virtual therapists by voice, video, or chat anytime.[11] Similarly, AI models are tested to deliver micro-intervention for parents[4] and also significantly reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.[12] AI-based virtual reality therapy allows patients to experience and confront their fears in a controlled and safe environment. It is widely used for patients with anxiety, phobia, and PTSD.[13] Further, industrial AI efficiently enhances workers' mental health and addresses a variety of mental health concerns.[14,15] Speech analysis technology uses machine learning algorithms to analyze speech patterns and identify emotional states. This technology helps to identify patients who are at risk of depression or anxiety and also be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.[16] CHALLENGES Because mental illnesses are highly subjective, have complicated symptoms, differ from person to person, and have strong sociocultural linkages, their diagnosis requires thorough investigation.[17] Joyce et al. argue that the mental illness etiology, signs and symptoms, and outcomes are highly interrelated. Further, the determinants of mental illness are multi-factorial, i.e. biological, social, and psychological. Hence, the AI models' understandability of mental illness needs to be heightened.[18] Suppose an AI model is prepared with responses from unauthentic data. In that case, it can offer false information about the illness and improper guidance, possibly harmful to persons with mental illness.[19,20] The difficulties that AI in mental health must overcome before it can contribute to a strong base as a support tool in mental health management are indicated by the absence of information to ensure reproducibility and transparency.[21] Based on nonrepresentative samples, there is a possibility of creating biased models. Older adults have been demonstrated to be capable of learning and using tools with specialized programs; however, they are at significant risk of being excluded from AI studies due to their limited access to and familiarity with technologies.[22] There are no established guidelines for the appropriate use of data standards and nursing terminologies. Nursing documentation must be consistent even within a facility adopting standard nursing terminology. Nursing data cannot be routinely used for quality measurement or improvement because of poor recordkeeping and a lack of consensus on standards.[23] FUTURE Earning the trust and confidence of clinicians should be the foremost consideration in implementing any AI-based decision support system.[24] While AI developers are keen to concentrate on person-like solutions, partnerships with mental health professionals are necessary to ensure a person-centered approach to future mental health care is required.[25] Studies emphasize the value of contextualizing interventions and recommend that scalable and evidence-based mental health care be available to large populations through AIs.[12] App Advisor is a creative project of the App Evaluation Model that the American Psychiatric Association developed to evaluate applications for their effectiveness, acceptability, safety, and capacity to provide mental health care.[20] At the same time, strong laws are needed to protect individuals or groups from harm by accessing, disclosing, or manipulating mental health data.[26,27] AI cannot accurately diagnose mental illnesses, so it cannot replace clinicians' diagnoses soon. The underlying difficulty in diagnosing mental illnesses using AI is not technological or entirely data-related but rather our general understanding of mental illness.[17] Many years of therapeutic transcripts are required to offer an inexpensive tool capable of delivering complex and tailored therapeutic models with high fidelity, compassion, and perfect recall that can simultaneously engage thousands of clients.[28] CONCLUSION AI is paving the way for more personalized, efficient, and effective mental health care. To realize AI's potential while reducing the possible harm, substantial effort should go toward the careful and thoughtful introduction of these AI technologies into global mental health.

Satisfaction of these basic needs facilitates people's autonomous motivation (i.e., acting with a sense of full endorsement and volition), whereas thwarting the needs promotes controlled motivation (i.e., feeling pressured to behave in particular ways) or being amotivated (i.e., lacking intentionality). Satisfying these basic needs and acting autonomously have been consistently shown to be associated with psychological health and effective performance. Social contexts within which people operate, however proximal (e.g., a family or workgroup) or distal (e.g., a cultural value or economic system), affect their need satisfaction and type of motivation, thus affecting their wellness and effectiveness. Social contexts also affect whether people's life goals or aspirations tend to be more intrinsic or more extrinsic, and that in turn affects important life outcomes.",

      "title": "Cutting Corners: Neuropsychological Research into the Energetics of ADHD",
      "abstract": "People with ADHD are often subject to normative judgments by others for not doing their best, or being lazy. At school, the teachers’ urge that they should put more effort into school work, may often be phrased as a question of will rather than lacking ability. Figuratively they could be said to cut corners, in the sense that they often perform tasks the easiest way. Even though they may know the long term advantages of hard work or of performing dull tasks, they may nonetheless follow the desires of the moment. This deficit in volition or self control has been construed as an aspect of behavioural inhibition or executive functioning (EF) (Barkley, 1997) considered as a core deficit in ADHD. Executive functions exert a top top-down mediating role on other cognitive processes, such as attention, learning and motor function. An ongoing discussion is whether impaired top-down processing is sufficient to explain ADHD, or sufficient to explain the heterogeneity of ADHD symptomatology. For some time, most neurocognitive research has focused on EF functions, clearly showing that subjects with ADHD are deficient in such tasks. However, there are four problems with considering this EF impairment as the cause of disordered behaviour.",

Two issues complicate its use: (a) The concept of strengths has different meanings and functions, depending on whether viewed as part of assessment, intervention, or outcome, and (b) the strengths perspective is an applied concept operating only through the medium of a specific intervention, not a modality whose efficacy can be independently evaluated. When these factors are ignored, the role of the strengths perspective can seem vague, peripheral, too obvious and “soft” to be a serious component of the change process–-yet, understood in context, it is an essential element of social work's unique approach.",

In this mini review, we examined the main conceptualizations and approaches for assessing cognitive flexibility: (1) neuropsychological tasks, (2) self-report questionnaires, and (3) neuroscientific approaches. The reviewed evidence shows that the definition and assessment of cognitive flexibility are not unified within the field and suggests that a more consensual and consistent conceptualization and operationalization of this important concept is needed.

Literature approach is employed in this study to describe everything obtained to increase understanding related to motivation to learn. In general, motivation is divided into two, namely intrinsic and extrinsic. Problems that always cause difficulties for students to learn are internal factors that include cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains, while external factors cover all situations and environmental conditions that do not support student learning activities. In addition, other factors that are more specifically causing difficulties for students in learning are dyslexia (inability to learn to read); dysgraphia (inability to learn or to write) and dyscalculia (inability to learn mathematics).",

Are different manifestations of self-awareness demonstrated in multiple experiments interrelated on some common basis, or unrelated and standalone? In this work, we set out to approach these questions on the basis of the perspective of organization and processing of the information about the sensory environment of an intelligent system, external and internal. We conjecture that a possible basis for understanding the development and evolution of self-awareness can be the theory of complex coordinated intelligent responses that require a coordination of multiple “atomic” actions to achieve the most effective, beneficial outcome for the intelligent system. In this approach, self-awareness can emerge naturally as an information model of the sensory environments that facilitates the production of effective responses via fitness selection. We consider different types and levels of self-awareness demonstrated in studies and experiments and discuss how it can be connected with the organization and functions of the information model of the environment involved in the formation of intelligent decisions. The information approach to self-awareness is used to discuss possible directions of evolution of the information models in the natural and artificial intelligent systems",

      "abstract": "The concept of resilience refers to the capacity of certain individuals either to adapt successfully to adversity, or to function in a competent manner when faced with a traumatic situation. The concept of resilience represents a new paradigm in the field of clinical psychology. It puts into perspective determinist models, whether they be psychological (experiences incurred during the first years of life forever seal the destiny of a subject) or biological (an individual is defined by his/her genes). It permits the study of an individual according to his/her resources and no longer according to his/her faults. Nevertheless, for several years, resilience has suffered from its own success by being frequently used in inappropriate contexts. With the aim of better understanding this concept and of avoiding its determinist and normative distortion, we present here a review of the different factors (psychological, family, sociological and biological factors) contributing to the process of resilience. Moreover, in the discussion, we present some methodological and conceptual issues presented by the concept of resilience.",

      "title": "FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION OF THE SELF-CONCEPT OF PERSONALITY",
      "abstract": "The self-concept of an individual is constantly in interaction with the environment, which often has a negative impact on it. A positive self-concept is an important condition for the full functioning of an individual. A positive self-concept manifests itself through a person's positive attitude towards himself/herself, adequate self-esteem, a sense of his/her own integrity, and the desire to realize his/her potential. A person with a formed positive self-concept is characterized by stable psychological health and, in general, has a high level of psychological well-being. The self-concept of an individual faces various life challenges every day, functions in traumatic situations, is influenced by the social environment, and therefore can undergo transformations. Often, a person is not aware of these transformations, but notices that his/her life has changed for the worse - apathy, feelings of insecurity, emotional exhaustion, decreased self-esteem, etc. have appeared. These negative formations appear due to the transformation of the self-concept, therefore, the study of the factors and features of this process is necessary for the development of measures to overcome the consequences, restore harmony, and master effective strategies of behavior in specific situations. The self-concept of an individual is affected by two groups of factors - external and internal. They cause constructive and destructive transformations that lead to the formation of a positive or negative self-concept. Empirically, transformation factors were identified for two components of self-concept: emotional-evaluative and behavioral. The constructive transformation of the emotional-evaluative component of the self-concept of the individual takes place under the influence of emotional stability, dominance, courage, straightforwardness, trustworthiness, calmness and relaxation, the desire for creativity, flexibility in communication, tolerance for uncertainty, values and autonomy, constructive sexuality, constructive aggression, constructive external delimitation of the Self, constructive anxiety, satisfaction with work experience in the specialty. The constructive transformation of the behavioral component of the self-concept of the individual takes place under the influence of courage, expressiveness, trustworthiness, dominance and calmness, constructive narcissism, constructive aggression, constructive external demarcation of the self. Destructive transformation of the emotional-evaluative component of the self-concept of a person occurs under the influence of emotional stability, courage, practicality of directness, anxiety, radicalism, intolerance of uncertainty, disorientation in time, contact and autonomy, deficit aggression, destructive anxiety, constructive narcissism, deficit narcissism, constructive internal demarcation of self. The destructive transformation of the behavioral component of the self-concept of the individual occurs under the influence of radicalism, sociability, courage, emotional stability, contact, values, destructive narcissism, constructive external demarcation of the self, deficient external demarcation of the self.",

There is a well-established psychological and psychiatric literature which documents the emotional trauma suffered by many, if not most, divorcing people. Little is known, however, about the ways in which the psychology of divorce interacts with dispute resolution. Qualitative data on subjective experiences of divorce was obtained by means of in-depth, unstructured, life-history interviews in which subjects were asked simply to tell the interviewer about their experiences of divorce and how disputes had arisen and been dealt with. Loss, anger, upset and sadness are the feelings reported most strongly, but others such as low self-esteem, fear, loneliness and numbness also feature prominently. Others, such as guilt, hatred, viciousness, loss of trust, a desire for vengeance, self pity and a sense of injustice were also spontaneously mentioned.",

Measurement models of individual differences in cognitive failures have failed to produce consistent results so far. In this article we establish a measurement model distinguishing three factors of self-reported cognitive failures labeled Clumsiness, Retrieval, and Intention forgotten. The relationships of the CFQ factors with a variety of self-report instruments are investigated. Measures of minor lapses, neuroticism, functional and dysfunctional self-consciousness, cognitive interference, and memory complaints provide evidence across several studies for the interpretation of self-reported cognitive failures as an aspect of neuroticism that primarily reflects general subjective complaints about cognition. We conclude that self-report measures about cognition ought to be interpreted as expressing worries about one’s cognition rather than measuring cognitive abilities themselves.",

This field of research termed \"multisensory integration’’ is flourishing, crossing borders between psychology and neuroscience. The focus of this chapter is on measures of multisensory integration based on numerical data collected from single neurons and in behavioral paradigms: spike numbers, reaction time, frequency of correct or incorrect responses in detection, recognition, and discrimination tasks. Defining that somewhat fuzzy term, it has been observed that at least some kind of numerical measurement assessing the strength of crossmodal effects is required. On the empirical side, these measures typically serve to quantify effects of various covariates on multisensory integration like age, certain disorders, developmental conditions, training and rehabilitation, in addition to attention and learning. On the theoretical side, these measures often help to probe hypotheses about underlying integration mechanisms like optimality in combining information or inverse effectiveness, without necessarily subscribing to a specific model.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the problem of uncertainty as an integral attribute of modern man's life. The importance of forming tolerance to uncertainty as an important means of organizing a person's life path is revealed. Manifestations of situations of uncertainty in student life are analyzed. Empirical data are presented that reveal the features of the development of uncertainty tolerance in future professionals. It is argued that uncertainty is an integral attribute of the life of a human being in the modern world, the basic features of which are multidimensionality, polysystems, continuous variability, the presence of many objective and subjective conflicts, the need to make decisions with insufficient information. The factors that complicate the subjective process of decision making and action are specified: - lack of clear knowledge of the nature of the phenomena that must be involved to overcome uncertainty; lack of clear evaluation criteria for the expediency and potential effectiveness of the available methods and directions for resolving the situation; a person's lack of a clear idea of ​​the results he wants to obtain; lack of clear awareness of their own resources, their sufficiency to resolve the situation and achieve the intended ones. It has been proven that in a situation of uncertainty there can be two main types of emotional experiences: positive (interest, curiosity) and negative (fear or anxiety), as well as different coping strategies: stimulating activity and blocking activity. This was the basis for introducing such concepts as \"tolerant / intolerant personality\", \"tolerance / intolerance to uncertainty\". The results of the empirical study revealed: a) insufficient readiness of a considerable part of the interviewed students to overcome situations of insignificance, especially in the sphere of interpersonal relations; b) the presence in one third of students of signs of professional uncertainty in the context of professional choice; c) limited ability of students to produce various ways of solving uncertainty situations.",

Adopting from behavioral economics the concept of a ``personal equilibrium\" --- a situation in which an individual's psychological state produces feedback effects reinforcing that state --- we posit that insecurity arises when an individual at a high-self-esteem equilibrium recognizes the potential of falling to a low-esteem equilibrium. Presenting a basic version of this model, generalizing it to incorporate the potential for multiple dimensions of self-esteem, reference-dependence (adaptation), and elaborating on the dynamic processes it implies, we show that the model can help to make sense of a wide range of cognitive, hedonic and behavioral phenomena: overconfidence and the impostor syndrome, under- and over-achieving, information avoidance, self-handicapping, dropout from school and the labor-market, defensive aggression, rejection sensitivity, the reasons and consequences of the failure to apologize, workaholism, the effects of trauma, and a wide range of well-documented gender differences.",

It considers three concepts for the adolescent experience: identity, competence, and exploration preferences. Identity is a universal term used with diverse connotations; it retains little specific meaning. Its status as a psychological concept is barely intact. Sense of competency is defined simply as the individual's self-report experience of being able to do something well. A competency is any behavior or set of behaviors that constitutes a perceived skill. The interviewers as a group undertook a training program designed to assure optimal and standard use of the interview protocol as an assessment procedure. The independent variable of exploration at least benefited from some operational definition: scores on an experimental questionnaire. The chapter confirms the general hypothesis that the school environments distinguish between students on several dependent measures.",

Human common-sense reasoning is far more sophisticated than any current artificial intelligence models can capture; yet people's performance on, for example, simple conditional inference, while perhaps explicable in probabilistic terms, is by no means effortless and noise-free. It may be that human reasoning and decision making function best in the context of highly adapted cognitive processes such as basic learning, deploying world knowledge, or perceptuomotor control. Indeed, what is striking about human cognition is the ability to handle, even to a limited extent, reasoning and decision making in novel, hypothetical, verbally stated scenarios, for which our past experience and evolutionary history may have provided us with only minimal preparation.",

Spirituality is one such tool to cope up with stress-related issues. is an inner path enabling a person to discover the essence of happiness, salvation of his being.

Compassion which is fundamental to spirituality opens their heart to others; develop empathy, effective communication and interpersonal relationship skills. As students get more personal development through spiritual practices, they are more effective and responsible. Empathy, problem solving, critical thinking and decision-making abilities must be well developed in students to achieve success. Coping with stress and emotions gives them strength to adjust in difficult situations and feel more confident to manage their personal issues and outside problems. Spiritual practices including meditation, prayer and contemplation will help students to cultivate his or her inner life and character. According to Swami Vivekananda, The greatest help to spiritual life is meditation. In meditation we divest ourselves of all material conditions and feel our divine nature. If we are not prepared we may experience trauma and chaos. According to Swami Vivekananda, It is fear that is the cause of our woes, and it is fearlessness that brings heaven in a moment.Literature ReviewDefining StressStress is derived from the Latin word 'string ere', meaning 'to draw tight', and was used in 17th century to describe hardships or affliction. During the late 18th century stress denoted force, pressure, strain or strong effort, referring primarily to an individual or to an individual's organs or mental powers (Hinkle, 1973). According to Selye (1956),Stress like relativity, is a scientific concept which has suffered from the mixed blessing of being too well known and too little and in his General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) Model, he described how the body passes through three stages in response through threat. first stage is an alarm reaction in preparation for a potential emergency, where heart beats faster, breathing becomes rapid and deep, blood pressure shoots up, blood vessels dilate and digestion slows down. second stage is resistance, in which body builds up tolerance to stress using its adaptive energies as a shield against stressors. On depletion of the adaptive energies, the alarm reaction symptoms reappear and stress manifests itself as an illness in the form of ulcers, high blood pressures and heart ailments.This is the third stage of exhaustion. concept of 'stress' is elusive as it is poorly defined. is understood by all in general context but by very few when used precisely and here lay the central problem. Stress can be understood as any action, stimulus or situation that puts extreme physical or psychological demands upon an individual (Cox, 1985). Stress is caused when an individual is subjected to special demands or external pressures and tension as internal pressures (Saunders, 1997). In the 1970s, Lazarus (1976) suggested that an individual's stress reaction depends on how the person interprets or appraises (consciously or unconsciously) the significance of a harmful, threatening or challenging event. …",

      "abstract": "Cognitive psychology has provided valuable theoretical perspectives on learning mathematics. Based on the metaphor of the mind as an information processing device, educators and psychologists have developed detailed models of competence in a variety of areas of mathematical skill and understanding. Unquestionably, these models are an asset in thinking about the curriculum we want our students to follow. But any psychological paradigm has aspects of learning and knowledge that it accounts for well, and others that it accounts for less well. For instance, the paradigm of cognitive science gives us valuable models of the knowledge we want our students to acquire; but in picturing the mind as a computational device it reduces us to conceiving of learning in individualist terms. It is less useful in helping us develop effective learning communities in our classrooms. In this paper I review some of the significant accomplishments of cognitive psychology for mathematics education, and some of the directions that situated cognition theorists are taking in trying to understand knowing and learning in terms that blend individual and social perspectives.",

For example, when a student does well in an exam, she may attribute the success to her intelligence or hard work. When she does poorly, on the other hand, she may blame the failure on the teacher's unfair grading or her roommate's party the night before.

      "abstract": "Η αναπηρία είναι μια κατάσταση που απασχολεί ένα ευρύ αριθμό του ανθρώπινου πληθυσμού. Τα άτομα με αναπηρία μπορεί να αναφερθεί ότι από τη φύση τους έχουν την ανάγκη για αυτονομία αλλά και ελευθερία στον τρόπο με τον οποίο συμπεριφέρονται στη ζωή τους και στις καθημερινές τους ασχολίες. Η αυτονομία και η ανεξαρτησία των ατόμων στις συμπεριφορές αναφέρεται ότι χρειάζεται κατάλληλη διαχείριση από τους ίδιους τους εαυτούς τους. Ο τρόπος με τον οποίο οι άνθρωποι διαχειρίζονται και οδηγούν τον εαυτό τους, τις τελευταίες δεκαετίες, υποστηρίζεται ότι μπορεί να προσεγγιστεί κατάλληλα μέσω της έννοιας της αυτοηγεσίας. Ο σκοπός της παρούσας διατριβής ήταν η εκτίμηση του επιπέδου της αυτόνομης λειτουργίας των ατόμων με κινητική αναπηρία, μέσω της εξέτασης του αντιληπτού επιπέδου χρήσης των στρατηγικών της αυτοηγεσίας. Άλλοι σκοποί ήταν ο έλεγχος διαφορών των στρατηγικών της αυτοηγεσίας σε σχέση με ένα σύνολο δημογραφικών στοιχείων, όπως είναι (π.χ., το φύλο, η ηλικία, ο χρόνος εμφάνισης της αναπηρίας, ο τύπος της αναπηρίας, η συμμετοχή ή μη σε φυσικές δραστηριότητες και το είδος των φυσικών δραστηριοτήτων), και η εξέταση της σχέσης των στρατηγικών αυτοηγεσίας με τις ψυχολογικές έννοιες της αυτοαποτελεσματικότητας, της βούλησης, και του προσανατολισμού στόχου για το εάν είναι δυνατή η πρόβλεψη της ικανότητας της αυτοηγεσίας. Το δείγμα σε αυτή τη μελέτη περιέλαβε 341 άτομα με κινητική αναπηρία και των δύο φύλων άνδρες (η = 225) και γυναίκες (η = 116), ηλικίας 11-70 ετών (ΜΟ = 36.98, ΤΑ = 12.08). Όλοι οι συμμετέχοντες συμπλήρωσαν τα παρακάτω εργαλεία μέτρησης: Για την εκτίμηση της αυτοηγεσίας το RSLQ-Gr το οποίο περιέχει 25 ερωτήσεις δομημένες σε οκτώ διακριτές υποκλίμακες. Για την Γενική αυτοαποτελεσματικότητα το New General Self-Efficacy Scale το οποίο περιέχει 8 ερωτήσεις σε μια μονοδιάστατη μορφή. Για τη βούληση, το Measure Athletes’ Volition-Short το οποίο περιέχει 15 ερωτήσεις δομημένο σε τρεις υποκλίμακες. Για τον προσανατολισμό στόχου το Task and Ego Orientation in Sports Questionnaire το οποίο περιέχει 13 ερωτήσεις σε δύο διαστάσεις. Τα αποτελέσματα της παρούσας διατριβής φανέρωσαν ότι τα άτομα με κινητική αναπηρία εμφανίζουν ορισμένες θετικές τάσεις αυτοαναγνώρισης, ωστόσο η αυτοηγεσία είναι μια στάση που δεν φαίνεται να έχει εφαρμογή σε μεγάλο βαθμό σε αυτόν τον πληθυσμό ανθρώπων. Μια προσπάθεια δημιουργίας παρακινητικών καταστάσεων για την επίτευξη ευχάριστων στιγμών χωρίς εξωτερικές επιδράσεις, δηλαδή μέσω αυτοανταμοιβών. Μια τάση για θετικές εποικοδομητικές σκέψεις. Μια συσχέτιση του μεγαλύτερου αριθμού στρατηγικών αυτοηγεσίας με την αυτοαποτελεσματικότητα, τη βούληση και τον προσανατολισμό στόχου. Επίσης, έδειξαν την επίδραση των παραγόντων όπως της ηλικίας, του φύλου, της μόρφωσης, της κινητικής δραστηριότητας, και του τύπου αναπηρίας στη διαμόρφωση της αυτοηγεσίας. Ακόμη, τα ευρήματα αυτής της διατριβής φανέρωσαν την προβλεπτική ικανότητα της αυτοαποτελεσματικότητας στις στρατηγικές του αυτοκαθορισμού στόχου, αυτοανταμοιβής, φυσικής ανταμοιβής, αξιολόγησης πεποιθήσεων και νοερής απεικόνισης, των βουλητικών ικανοτήτων της σκοπιμότητας στις στρατηγικές αυτοκαθορισμός στόχου, αυτοανταμοιβή, αξιολόγηση πεποιθήσεων και νοερή απεικόνιση, της αποφασιστικότητας στις στρατηγικές αυτοανταμοιβή, αυτο-υπενθύμιση και νοερή απεικόνιση, και της επιμονής στις στρατηγικές αυτοανταμοιβή και φυσική ανταμοιβή, και τέλος των πτυχών του προσανατολισμού στόχου του έργου στις στρατηγικές φυσική ανταμοιβή, αυτοκαθορισμό στόχου, αξιολόγηση πεποιθήσεων και νοερής απεικόνισης και του εγώ στη στρατηγική της αυτοανταμοιβής.",

      "abstract": "Interaction of information levels of perception can influence the effectiveness of solving many practical problems, including politics, economy, medicine, etc. Therefore, this is a problem, or the problem situation, which includes episodes of human activity occurring with both optimal and unjustified costs. The purpose of this article is the identification and analysis of the practical effects and associated phenomena which arise from the problem. To achieve this, in accordance with the individual capacity of information channels to produce consciousness responses of different intensity their hierarchy was built: taste, touch, smell, hearing, sight, natural human language, graphic language, the language of numbers, the language of concepts and the language of empty words (sight and natural human language are border channels connecting the semiotic and sensory types of perception). The interaction between the levels of the hierarchy may initiate the increasing and interference effects as well as their attendant phenomena. The increasing effect is accompanied by improvement of professional skills, emergence of excess skill, mistaken assessment of the process. The phenomenon of improving professional skills detects itself in examples of people who manage complex processes because of the semiotic and sensory contact with the object of perception. In these cases, sensory perception enhances the effects of the semiotic one. The phenomenon of excess skills arises with the faster growth of professional skills in comparison with the increasing complexity of tasks. Being closely associated with the improvement of skills, this phenomenon may cover both humans and animals. Excess skill often becomes a source of negative stress, which can be eliminated by irrational complex tasks, which imply getting the desired result at highest, not smallest, costs. Associated with the two phenomena mistaken assessment of the process covers a wide range of professionals who do not perceive their tasks as complex ones and invite untrained people to solve them, thus provoking by adverse situations. The interference effect arises from the competition between the levels. It removes the unclear'' features of objects from the analysis and lowers the intellectual characteristics of the person. In the first case, the person may underestimate the factors or phenomena s/he deals with by the lower levels of the hierarchy (language of empty words) unfairly focusing their attention on the events perceived by the upper levels. Errors caused by this phenomenon can be quite substantial and manifest in both economy and politics. Reduction of the intellectual characteristics of the person occurs because of the prolonged interference effect and can be observed on the example of psychiatrists who have worked with the mentally ill for decades and acquired similar features.",

      "title": "Pentingnya Trait Mindfulness pada Mahasiswa",
      "abstract": "Abstract. University students are frequently exposed to academic pressures such as workload and performance demands, making them highly vulnerable to stress. When unmanaged, academic stress can negatively impact mental health and academic motivation. Therefore, identifying psychological traits that help students adaptively cope with stress is crucial. One such trait is trait mindfulness, a dispositional tendency to be fully aware of the present moment in a nonjudgmental manner. Research has shown that trait mindfulness plays a protective role against academic stress by enhancing emotional regulation, sleep quality, attentional control, and working memory. It also fosters resilience, helping students respond more adaptively to academic demands. Although considered an innate characteristic, trait mindfulness can be cultivated through mindfulness training. As a topic of growing interest in positive psychology, trait mindfulness is associated with reduced rumination, improved focus, and greater engagement in academic life. This literature-based overview emphasizes the significance of trait mindfulness as a psyhcological asset that supports students academic well-being and performance. Enchancing trait mindfulness may serve as an effective strategy to promote adaptive coping and academic success among university students. Abstrak. Mahasiswa seringkali menghadapi tekanan akademik berupa beban tugas dan tuntutan pencapaian prestasi, yang memunculkan stres akademik yang berdampak pada keterlibatan belajar mahasiswa. Oleh karena itu, penting untuk melihat faktor psikologis yang dapat membantu mahasiswa menghadapi stres secara adaptif. Salah satu faktor yang terbukti efektif adalah trait mindfulnes, yaitu karakteristik bawaan untuk membantu individu hadir secara penuh tanpa menghakimi. Beberapa penelitian menunjukkan bahwa trait mindfulness dapat melindungi mahasiswa dari dampak negatif stres akademik dengan cara meningkatkan regulasi emosi, kualitas tidur, dan perhatian. Selain itu, trait mindfulness juga berperan dalam meningkatkan resiliesi, memori kerja, dan keterlibatan akademik. Sebagai asek yang alami dimiliki namun dapat ditingkatkan melalui pelatihan, trait mindfulness suatu topik yang penting dalam psikologi positif. Dalam akademik, keberadaan trait mindfulness membantu mahasiswa untuk lebih sadar dalam menghadapi situasi stres, mengurangi perenungan negatif dan meningkatkan kemudahan dalam adaptasi. Berdasarkan hasil literatur bahwa trait mindfulness merupakan hal penting dalam psikologis seseorang yang mendukung untuk mendapatkan kesejahteraan dan keberlanjutan akademik mahasiswa.",

      "abstract": "Life skills refer to a person's ability to do life well through the successful completion of everyday tasks and a meaningful engagement at school, at work, at home and in the community. However, several scholars have critiqued existing approaches to life skills teaching in sport, often situated as individualistic and focused on economic productivity and integration in predetermined social orders. For the teaching of life skills in sport to instigate social change, coaching approaches must consider broader structures of power, privilege and oppression. The purpose of the paper is to propose a two continua model coalescing implicit/explicit approaches and normative/transformative dimensions of how coaches can teach life skills through sport. The model is designed to account for how coaches can be implicit or explicit in their approaches to teaching life skills, doing so in manners that can be normative or transformative. Within each of the model's quarter-circles, examples are offered as to how coaches can teach life skills in approaches considered normative implicit, normative explicit, transformative implicit and transformative explicit. In the transformative explicit quarter-circle, the concept of social justice life skills is expanded to include dignity, reciprocity, transformative leadership and critical consciousness. Implications for research and practice are offered in terms of situating youth development from a relational perspective and positioning transformative change as a complex process that carries certain challenges and risks for coaches and youth. The two continua model for life skills teaching offers researchers and coaches a conceptual framework that delineates actions that can be taken to enact transformative pedagogies, while also opening new horizons for what life skills can become when envisioned with social change in mind.",

      "title": "A framework for using learning theories to inform ‘growth mindset’ activities",
      "abstract": "The social psychology theory of fixed and growth mindsets offers one reason for observed underachievement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), particularly for students who have previously excelled in these disciplines. Fixed mindset beliefs are linked to behaviours that can lead to avoiding challenges and reduced learning, such as concealing a lack of understanding to retain an image of being 'smart'. The potential impact of a growth mindset on STEM achievement, particularly for minority and low-household-income students, resulted in calls to develop interventions that encourage growth mindsets and discourage fixed mindsets. However, education interventions are influenced by the educator's understanding of how learning occurs. A framework to show how activities based on different learning theories may encourage growth mindsets or (unintentionally) encourage fixed mindsets can guide the developers of growth mindset interventions. We present such a framework in six tables relating to key areas associated with growth and fixed mindsets: dealing with challenges, persistence, effort, praise, the success of others and learning goals. Each table gives examples of learning activities that may encourage growth or fixed mindsets, fitting with each of four key learning theories: behaviourism, constructivism, communities of practice and connectivism.",

      "title": "[P2–480]: A MULTI‐MODAL INTERVENTION TO ENHANCE COGNITIVE COMPENSATION STRATEGIES AND PROMOTE BRAIN HEALTH ACTIVITIES",
      "abstract": "Neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) start decades before diagnosis. Subjective cognitive concerns (SCC) and subtle changes in functional abilities also begin very early. Older adults with difficulties in everyday executive and memory abilities are at risk for eventually losing independence in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and progressing towards mild cognitive impairment or AD. Thus, there is a critical window of opportunity for intervention to delay further loss of function. This unique multidimensional intervention builds on compensatory training with other populations to directly target the functional abilities most likely to maintain independent living. Targeted compensatory training includes 1) a calendar system to support planning and memory, 2) goal planning and task-lists to increase sense of purpose and accomplish goals, 3) an organization system to maximize daily efficiency. This multidimensional intervention program also targets engagement in healthy lifestyle activities (physical/cognitive exercise, emotional wellbeing) to promote brain health. This project tests the feasibility and efficacy of a 10-week intervention designed to enhance compensation skills to directly support everyday activities among independent cognitively normal older adults with SCC. A primary goal is to provide evidence that the intervention results in changes in target behaviors. Secondary goals are to obtain preliminary evidence of the program's impact on everyday function. A randomized wait-list control (WLC) group design will be employed. Initial recruitment is as follows: 50 individuals attended information sessions about the program or received information over the phone, 30 were not interested due mostly to travel complications or schedule conflict, and 20 were randomized with 10 individuals to each the immediate and WLC group. Results from previous pilot data (n=30) provide preliminary evidence that this intervention can result in enhanced compensation skills and more frequent engagement in cognitively stimulating activities and changes can be maintained at three month follow up. Pilot data for this intervention indicates a well-accepted, novel intervention to support everyday function. Initial recruitment data highlights recruitment complications, most notably travel difficulties for older adults. Thus, this intervention will be provided more directly in the community in which older adults live to enhance recruitment.",

Se encuentra que existen diferencias significativas en el foco atencional y en control inhibitorio, lo cual no incide de modo fundamental en los procesos cognitivos de atención y memoria, siendo significativo en el foco atencional, en el control inhibitorio y en el desarrollo y eficiencia de las funciones ejecutivas. Esto a su vez interfiere en la toma de decisiones socialmente funcionales. Se recomienda diseñar y aplicar estudios transversales que sean indicadores descriptivosy predictivos de conductas psicopáticas y/o delictivas para el peritaje y que posteriormente faciliten su rehabilitación e inclusión social.Conclusión: el rendimiento cognitivo en atención y memoria es similar al de las personas sin conductas delictivas pues están dentro de la clasificación normal siendo su mayor interferente conductual el déficit en funciones ejecutivas las cuales son mayoritariamente las reguladoras conductuales.",

This perspective, however, does not consider that a patient with dementia is a human being who feels, thinks, wishes, and behaves. It also does not consider that the dysfunctional behavior may be related to the patient's other behaviors or to the behaviors of the patient's caregivers. Although rating scales are commonly used to assess behavioral disturbances, an assessment that a patient shouts, for example, is meaningless unless the situation in which the patient shouts is considered. What provoked the patient to shout? How does the caregiver react when the patient shouts? Understanding the context in which the behavioral disturbance occurs is important for developing effective care plans. Effective treatment is necessary because behavioral disturbances can negatively affect the quality of care received by institutionalized patients with dementia.",

It is the ability to motivate oneself even in stressful situations, to control impulsive behaviour and to manage feelings in perfect way. Emotional intelligence can be considered as a set of skills which contribute to the proper assessment and regulation of emotions, and the utilization of feelings for best achievement in academics, profession and life. Emotional Intelligence is an important predictor of success in life and has significant role in stress management and academic achievement. Students who are high academic performers, usually have higher emotional intelligence scores compared with children with scholastic backwardness. Individuals with high emotional intelligence will correctly understand emotional issues, manage stressful situations successfully and regulate emotions in the best way. They are balanced, empathetic, self-aware and sociable. They have very strong will-power and are intrinsically motivated. Emotional intelligence is also a crucial factor needed for successful leadership. It has significant role in academic and organizational success.",

It considers developmental changes in societal conceptualization, scientific knowledge, and identity construction from a cognitive perspective. Cognitive development refers to the successive levels of intellectual adaptation, from birth to adulthood. Logical coordination of these representations does not occur until a later period of development. This new coordination occurs between about 6 or 7 and 11 or 12 years of age and takes the form of concrete operations which are gradually elaborated across the various domains of intellectual functioning. Adolescent thinking, compared to the child one, is generally simply considered as “abstract” thinking. The various functional domains are often supposed to partly depend on a general cognitive developmental factor.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary science can be seen and described as a production process.There is both an input with an investment in manpower, time, facilities, and an output with a product: knowledge.In such a model one accumulates this knowledge and stores it in articles, books, libraries, abstracts, and computers.The output can be measured in a so-called evaluation of objectives whose outcomes are predictable.Hence one necessarily develops objectives of a certain kind: that is, objectives that have predictable and measureable outcomes.In this view, science becomes a technological tool: in the natural sciences a tool for controlling nature, and in the social sciences a tool to use in controlling human beings.Too often this is the case in educational science.One has to produce practical tools: for example, programs for reading and, as a part of those, tests to evaluate those programs.Effects can then be measured ensuring that the desired outcomes have in fact been attained.One uses these programs to control: in particular, to control powerless people like children, inmates, or handicapped people.Even teachers and professors are not free from the controlling impact of these tests.However, there are some practical problems with pursuing this model.Too often it brings us (in order to maintain the \"hard,\" \"quantifying\" approach) to strange, alienating conclusions: for example, the 36 assumption that if reading scores are higher, the school system really is a more effective learning environment.This strange kind of thinking (strange only if you reflect upon it) affects our way of looking at schools and children when we try to fit the everyday reality that we experience into the tiny dimensions of our poor models.In the area of so-called \"moral\" education, rather than attempting to understand children's real ethical dilemmas, we see only moral development inventories as outlined by Lawrence Kohlberg and other experts.This narrow way of seeing affects the daily reality of our \"professional\" interaction with our \"subjects,\" be they children or other \"powerless\" individuals.Real people become program-dependent entities!An alternative vision for social science may be more helpful, more concerned with human interests.1A little anecdote may illustrate my point further: Erwin Strauss once told the story of a professor who invited ten guests for dinner.When two extra people unexpectedly arrived, he was both embarrassed and concerned about the quantity of food he had prepared.However, when this same man anticipated twenty people for a lecture he was to deliver, and there were forty people in the audience, he was not embarrassed.Indeed, he felt gratified by the good response.Hence we see that scientific knowledge cannot be conceived as a static stock of deposits, filed away in a storeroom.Rather, it is constituted as a freely given relationship among people.Science is fundamentally a \"social\" phenomenon.It is a dynamic relationship among people who talk and write for an audience of fellow",

      "abstract": "The historical aspect and the essence of the term of readiness for work as a special mental state; a necessary and extremely important component of a successful professional life of a person is studied in the article. Readiness for a certain phenomenon helps person to adapt more quickly and to fulfill his duties more successfully. It contributes to the development of personality. The author points out that an analysis of the problem of readiness shows that the genesis of this concept is related to the development and understanding of the concept of \"psychological readiness for work\". It can be defined as permanent (as a result of labor education) or temporary (as a result of psychological training or psychological mobilization during this period) mental condition, which is caused due to the need for work. The question of the readiness of a specialist for professional activity is studied within such sciences as: psychology, pedagogy, philosophy. The author's determination of readiness is formulated during the conduction of the research. The author proposes to understand the readiness as a complex integrative formation, characterizing a particular mental state. It is a necessary and essential component of a successful professional life of the individual. It helps a person to adapt more quickly, to fulfill his professional duties more successfully; it promotes professional development of a specialist. Readiness includes not only professional characteristics and skills, but either personal trait. The conclusion is made that since readiness is a dynamic value, it means that its course is determined by age, by learning experience, individual abilities of the person and so on. The author summarizes the importance of the development of psychological readiness for work during the formation of the personality of a modern specialist. It is emphasized that professional readiness cannot be the same as a subjective professional readiness. According to the modern scientific researches the author distinguishes particular levels of professional readiness, such as: high (autonomy in setting and solving new tasks, adequacy of assessment and self-assessment of professionally important qualities, ability to effectively solve problems during time deficit, etc.); average (average level of expression of the mentioned qualities); and low (inability to set and solve complex problems independently, inadequate assessment and self-assessment of professionally important features, etc.",

      "abstract": "Strategy Five: Reshape Your Character Choose one intellectual trait (intellectual perseverance, autonomy, empathy, courage, humility, etc.) to strive for each month, focusing on how you can develop that trait in yourself. example, concentrating on intellectual humility, begin to notice when you admit you are wrong. Notice when you refuse to admit you are wrong, even in the face of glaring evidence that you are in fact wrong. Notice when you become defensive when another tries to point out a deficiency in your work or your thinking. Notice when your intellectual arrogance keeps you from learning, for example, when you say to yourself, already know everything I need to know about this subject, or, know as much as he does. Who does he think he is forcing opinions on me? By owning your ignorance, you can begin to deal with Strategy Six: Deal with Your Egocentrism Egocentric thinking is found in the disposition in human nature to think with an automatic, subconscious bias in favor of onesself. On a daily basis, you can begin to observe your egocentric thinking in action by contemplating questions like these: Under what circumstances do I think with an automatic, subconscious bias in favor of myself? Do I ever become irritable over small things? Do I do or say anything irrational to get my way? Do I try to impose my will upon others? Do I ever fail to speak my mind when I feel strongly about something and then later feel resentment? Once you identify egocentric thinking in operation, you can work to replace it with more rational thought through systematic self-reflection. example, think along the lines of: would a rational feel in this or that situation? What would a rational How does that compare with what I want to do? (Hint: If you find that you continually conclude that a rational would behave just as you behaved you are probably engaging in self-deception.) Strategy Seven: Redefine the Way You See Things We live in a world, both personal and social, in which every situation is defined, that is, given a meaning. How a situation is defined determines not only how we feel about it but also how we act in it and what implications it has for us. However, virtually every situation can be defined in more than one way. This fact carries with it tremendous opportunities. In principle, it lies within your power and mine to make our lives more happy and fulfilling. Many of the negative definitions which we give to situations in our lives could, in principle, be transformed into positive ones. We can be happy when otherwise we would have been sad. We can be fulfilled when otherwise we would have been frustrated. In this strategy we practice redefining the way we see things, turning negatives into positives, dead-ends into new beginnings, and mistakes into opportunities to learn. To make this strategy practical, we should create some specific guidelines for ourselves. example, we might make ourselves a list of 5 to 10 recurrent negative contexts in which we feel frustrated, angry, unhappy, or worried. We could then identify the definition in each case that is at the root of the negative emotion. We would then choose a plausible alternative definition for each and then plan for our new responses as well as new emotions. example, if you tend to worry about all problems, both the ones you can do something about and those that you can't, you can review the thinking in this nursery rhyme: For every problem under the sun, there is a solution or there is none. If there be one, think `til you find If there be none, then never mind it. Let's look at another example. You redefine your initial approach to a member of the opposite sex not in terms of the definition his or her response will determine whether or not I am an attractive person but in terms of the definition let me test to see if this is initially drawn to me, given the way they perceive me. …",

These are only some of the questions they have asked themselves. The vagueness of the term’s significance has determined the psychologists to reorient towards more remote scientific fields of research which could lead to more and more interesting answers. The concept of intelligence commonly refers to the general mental capacities such as language, thinking, memory and perception but also to sensorial and moving abilities. A person’s intelligence quotient reveals its ability to analyse, rationalise and solve problems, as well as the individual ability to adapt to new tendencies and challenges that may appear in the course of life. Given the complexity of the situations of communication, the scientists were determined to investigate other base abilities which every person possesses in certain amounts. The concept of intelligence covers different realities and constitutes the fundament on which multiple intelligence concept bases. Being intelligent means using others intelligence as well.",

Each of these steps is differentially influenced by heritable temperament dimensions, antecedent steps in character development, and life experiences.

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we explore some of the ways in which issues of health and well-being have become entwined with both individual and organizational learning. Specifically, we:\r\n•\tInterrogate the assumption that learning is automatically or necessarily good for us. \r\n•\tIntroduce the metaphor of organization-as-brain, highlighting how many of the most desirable characteristics of organization (intelligence, inventiveness, connectivity, flexibility, etc) take the brain and its capacity to learn as their implicit blueprint. \r\n•\tSuggest that a prioritisation of organizational learning constructs the ‘perfect employee’ as someone committed to ongoing self-development and self-reinvention.\r\n•\tExplore interrelations between learning and well-being, suggesting both that learning enhances well-being (learning enough to be well) and that well-being enhances learning (being well enough to learn).\r\n•\tReflect on how an emphasis on learning casts the individual as agent of his or her own employability, and hence responsible for the health benefits that continuous employment produces.\r\n•\tConsider the emotional costs of discourses of learning and reinvention, such as feelings of guilt, shame and a sense that one is never quite good enough. \r\n•\tReflect on how individualised responsibility for both learning and well-being casts popular organizational tools, such as personal development plans (PDPs), in a different light.",

      "title": "Situating epistemological development",
      "abstract": "Personal epistemology as a field has been around for forty years and generated a wide assortment of models to explain epistemological development Dominant frameworks are inspired either by Piagetian or information processing perspectives on cognition, and all have failed to explain a range of empirical results that question the stability and coherence predicted by these frameworks. Recent models from a more situated perspective seem much more capable of explaining the variability seen empirically. This paper adds to this situated perspective by outlining a research approach for locating epistemic beliefs within analyses that triangulate between people's participation in knowledge construction and evaluation, the artifacts such participation may produce, and individual's reflection upon both participation and artifacts. Examples of such work are used to demonstrate the fruitfulness of this approach. Epistemlc cognition and epistemlc belief What do people think knowledge is, or how we get it, or why we believe it, or what it means to know something? How do such ideas develop throughout people's Jives? How is that development shaped by the experiences people have, in schoo~ on the playground, in their homes, at their jobs, or anywhere else? How do these ideas influence how people think about their world, make judgments, solve problems, or Jearn new things? These questions are at the heart of the study of personal epistemology, people's beliefs about knowledge and knowing. The field of personal epistemology has been going strong for forty years now, generating a variety of models to account for the development of epistemological beliefs. This growth has occurred alongside, and perhaps even prompted, a concurrent growth in the educational concern that learning in the disciplines should include understanding of disciplinary epistemologies. Yet, none of the theoretical models put forth in the last forty years adequately explains the array of empirical findings within personal epistemology or related studies of epistemic cognition. Also over the last forty years, there has been a cultural tum in psychology, inspired by the theories developed by Vygotsky (1978) and his contemporaries, and further developed by many others (Cole, 1996; Engestr6rn, 1987; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Rogoff, 1990; Wenger, 1998; Wertsch, 1985). This cultural tum is largely absent in personal epistemology research. Indeed, it can be hard to discern in cognitive developmental research generally. Two features of sociocultural perspectives have particular importance to studies of epistemic cognition. One is the conceptualization of cognition as situated within activity, and the second is that all such activity is inherently cultural (and historical). The ways in which epistemic cognition may be situated has only recently begun to be theorized (Chinn, Buckland, & Samarapungavan, 2011; Hammer & Elby, 2002). My aim here is to build on these recent efforts in two ways. The first is to emphasize the ways in which epistemic cognition is culturally situated. That is, in order to properly understand the epistemic beliefs that individuals may develop it is necessary to understand how such beliefs derive from cultural activity, both everyday activity and activity situated within disciplinary cultures (e.g., of science). A second aim is to propose a particular approach to conducting situated research on epistemic cognition that can productively coordinate the range of research methods required to understand the complex terrain that is epistemic cognition. The argument proceeds in two parts. First, the major theoretical perspectives that have been proposed within the field of personal epistemology since Perry's (1970) seminal work are summarized. One might think such a summary hardly necessary given the quantity of recent reviews of personal epistemology research (Hofer & Bendixen, in press; Hofer & Pintrich, 2002; Khine, 2008; Muis, Bendixen, & Haerle, 2006). Such reviews are typically neutral in their evaluations of competing theories, however, whereas a critical examination emphasizes how existing models fail to explain available data. The second part of the argument then describes a situative perspective on epistemic cognition, what it looks like, what it can explain, and how it can be developed. Before getting into the main line of argument, it may be useful to clarity some terminology. The study of people's ideas about knowledge and knowing, and how these develop, has occurred primarily in two distinct strands of research. One of these is developmental research on the young child's theory of mind and the",

      "abstract": "Although there is no firm consensus on what constitutes an intelligent agent (or software agent), an intelligent agent, when a new task is delegated by the user, should determine precisely what its goal is, evaluate how the goal can be reached in an effective manner, and perform the necessary actions by learning from past experience and responding to unforeseen situations with its adaptive, self-starting, and temporal continuous reasoning strategies. It needs to be not only cooperative and mobile in order to perform its tasks by interacting with other agents but also reactive and autonomous to sense the status quo and act independently to make progress towards its goals (Baek et al., 1999; Wang, 1999). Software agents are goal-directed and possess abilities such as autonomy, collaborative behavior, and inferential capability. Intelligent agents can take different forms, but an intelligent agent can initiate and make decisions without human intervention and have the capability to infer appropriate high-level goals from user actions and requests and take actions to achieve these goals (Huang, 1999; Nardi et al., 1998; Wang, 1999). The intelligent software agent is a computational entity than can adapt to the environment, making it capable of interacting with other agents and transporting itself across different systems in a network.Request access from your librarian to read this chapter's full text.",

      "title": "Proposal of a common terminology for the neuropsychological rehabilitation",
      "abstract": "Abstract The literature on neuropsychological intervention (NI) uses a variety of terms to refer to equivalent constructs, making it difficult to compare intervention programmes and their outcomes. The purpose of this work is to propose a unified terminological framework for describing NI programmes. The terminological framework was developed based on a previous proposal for common terminology by Johnstone and Stonnington (Rehabilitation of neuropsychological disorders: A practical guide for rehabilitation professionals. Psychology Press, 2011) and driven by Cognitive Psychology concepts. The terminological framework was organized into two sections: (a) NI, which includes types of NI, methods and approaches, instructional methods, and strategies; and (b) neurocognitive functions, which include temporal and spatial orientation , sensation , perception , visuo‐constructional abilities , attention , memory , language , reasoning of several sorts (e.g., abstract reasoning, and numerical reasoning), and executive functions . Most NI tasks target a main neurocognitive function, but there are underlying neurocognitive functions that may impair performance in the former. Since it is difficult to create a task that is solely focused on one neurocognitive function, the proposed terminology should not be viewed as a taxonomy, but rather as dimensional, with the same task allowing to work different functions, in varying grades. Adopting this terminological framework will allow to define the targeted neurocognitive functions more accurately and simplify the comparison between NI programmes and their outcomes. Future research should focus on describing the main techniques/strategies for each neurocognitive function and non‐cognitive interventions.",

      "title": "Executive functions and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder",
      "abstract": "The field of executive functions comprises the operation of numerous intra-connected processes. The majority of them starts developing in the early period, however, they are most prominent in the school period, during which the activities become more complex, and during the tasks’ execution in the adult period. They affect our entire performance and its success. With persons with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) it is typical that their executive functions are less developed, consequently such individuals are not as successful as they could have been.\r\nSelf-regulation includes both cognitive and metacognitive processes. It means the management of one's behaviour, emotions, motivation… Its development begins in the early period, but it does not develop equally in all people. It has been defined by several authors who represent different theories but only Barkley's and Zimmerman's theories are summarised in this part.\r\nMetacognition is considered a self-regulative process. It has been identified as a metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, metacognitive skills and strategies and metacognitive objective by Flavell (1979, in Bakracevic Vukman, 2010). The metacognitive sections include the strategies of planning, regulation and monitoring. Metacognition also develops in the early period, therefore we need to help individuals in developing it with different strategies.\r\nAuthors like Barkley, Brown, Dawson & Guare and others have written about executive functions. Their definitions differ, nevertheless, they have many mutual points like self-regulation of emotions and motivation, working memory and inhibition of reaction.\r\n\r\nOur brain is a complex set of nerve cells, constantly connecting and thus carrying information, orders from one another. The frontal lobe has a special role in the development of executive functions, it is responsible for higher recognition processes, like thinking, which include planning, execution and the evaluation of tasks. Furthermore it affects the motoric execution of more advance and more complex tasks. Baddeley (2000, in Henry, 2012) presents two models of working memory. He has upgraded the original model by adding an episodic buffer. Other components of the working memory include the central implementation system and the system for temporary storage, divided into the phonological loop and the visual-spatial sketch.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to plan strategies to help develop the executive functions in people with ADHD, we need to be familiar with some general, psychological and developmental characteristics of the disorder. Furthermore we need to have good knowledge of the before mentioned theoretical basics. Only then we can establish relevant forms of assistance or strategies, which may be useful to a specific individual.",

      "title": "La motivación en las personas deficientes mentales",
      "abstract": "ResumenResumenLas investigaciones existentes sobre rasgos motivacionales en personas deficientes mentales encuentran en ellas expectativas de éxito más bajas y expectativas de fracaso más altas, autoconcepto y competencia percibida más bajos, atribuciones causales desfavorables, indefensión aprendida, menor motivación intrínseca y un lugar de control externo. Estos rasgos se adquieren evolutivamente y parecen depender, al menos parcialmente, de ciertos factores: segregación-integración, etiología de la deficiencia, institucionalización, socialización, feedback de los educadores, etc.Los estudios conocidos sobre entrenamiento motivational con deficientes mentales se han basado en la teoría de la atribución causal y son notablemente escasos, aunque se registran resultados positivos. En los últimos años, por otra parte, se ha desarrollado un modelo de entrenamiento metacognitivo que incluye un componente motivational (concretamente, atribucional)y que se muestra prometedor para los sujetos deficientes mentales.AbstractExisting research on motivational traits with mentally retarded individuals suggest that in comparisons with normal subjects they have: lower success expectancies and higher failure expectancies, lower self-concept and perceived competence, unfavourable causal attributions, learned helplessness, less intrinsic motivation and an external locus of control. These traits are acquired developmentally and they seem to depend, at least partially, on several factors: segregation-integration, etiology of retardation, institutionalization, socialization, educator's feedback, etc.Studies on motivational training with mentally retarded individuals have been based on causal attribution theory, and are remarkably scarce; though some positive results are reported. In the last few years, however, a model of metacognitive training that includes a motivational component—i. e., attributional—and that seems to be promising for mentally retarded individuals has been developed.Extended SummaryMotivational factors are of particular interest when it comes to studying the personality and performance of mentally retarded individuals. These individuals seem to possess characteristic motivational traits which interact with their intellectual limitations in complex ways.This work tries to offer an updated view of existing data on motivation in mentally retarded individuals, and also on current attempts at setting up intervention programmes.Mentally retarded individuals have, on the one hand, lower success expectancies and, on the other, higher failure expectancies than normal individuals. Their concept of self and perceived competence are also lower. Educational segregation or integration seems to influence their concept of self; segregated or partially intergrated individuals seem to have a certain advantage, though results from different studies are often contradictory.In relation to causal attributions, some studies (though certainly not all) find that mentally retarded individuals make negative attributions with respect to achievement motivation. Again the same can be said about studies on learned helplessness: some though not all studies have found this behaviour to be characteristic of mentally retarded individuals. However, it is worth pointing out that in most research work reporting this helplessness, the sample's etiology fulfills the requeriments of Zigler's developmental theory (1969, 1982a): familiar mentally retarded without known brain damage. The sample's etiology in studies that do not report this behaviour is either varied or not mentioned. Of special interest is the responsability attributed teachers and adults' feedback on the progressive development of learned helplessness.Studies on intrinsic motivation have found, in these individuals, several characteristic traits directly related to achievement motivation: lower preference for challenging tasks, and lower strive for performance, correction, and competence. A positive relation between intrinsic motivation, achievement, and level of incentive in mentally retarded individuals has also been reported. Studies adopting Zigler's developmental perspective (Zigler & Balla, 1982b), find that these individuals possess a marked external component, primarily in those that are institutionalized. This is concomitant with a low competence motivation, and an extrinsic approach; traits that suggest low achievement motivation.Studies focusing on locus of control generally agree that in mentally retarded individuals this is external; an internal source of control favourably correlates with achievement.Some studies support that these unfavourable motivational traits are learned during development and due to unfortunate socialization factors.Research work on motivational training with mentally retarded individuals is remarkably limited. In general published work has adopted a causal attribution framework with some positive results.Finally, Borkowsky and co-workers (Borkowsky and Kurtz, 1987; Borkowsky, Johnston and Reid, 1987) have presented an interesting metacognitive model that includes a motivational component, specifically an attributional component. This model pursues the improvement of the acquisition, maintenance, and generalization of abilities in both normal and mental retarded individuals. It consists of three components: strategies, metacognition, and motivation (causal attributions). Simultaneous training in these three components produces a reciprocal reinforcement between them. This model has already proved to be effective with normal and learning disabled individuals. The authors consider it to be promising for mentally retarded individuals, though possible benefits could be limited due to neurological based cognitive deficits.Palabras clave: Motivacióndeficiencia mental (retraso mental)logroatribución causalmotivación intrínsecaindefensión aprendidaKeywords: Motivationmental deficiency (mental retardation)achievementcausal attributionintrinsic motivationlearned helplessness",

Aristotelian virtue grows from self-mastery combined with intentionally learned skills of practice and striving with others to achieve a common purpose. Virtue expresses itself through judgment and action that flow from the integration of cognitive, emotional, perceptual, physical and relational attributes into pattern recognition and coordinated activity to achieve a purpose Athletic excellence embodies such integrated judgment and action. Personal, professional and athletic achievement all express similar structural virtues. Such intentional and virtuous action grows not only from self-discipline but self-knowledge and the cognitive commitment to study, learn, and master complex skills. It manifests as the integrated cognitive, emotional and physical ability to sacrifice and overcome obstacles. Athletic excellence further requires serious commitment to social community and its norms. Athletic achievement demonstrates how virtues such as self-mastery, sacrifice, courage, truthfulness, curiosity and learning, and honor and loyalty among others unite to support high levels of professional excellence. As a form of virtue, athletics possesses ethical worth that deserves respect and emulation.",

He regards it not only from the social view but he also allows for psychical, biological and spiritual aspects. Emotional demands which are without question brought to the social worker in his daily contact with his clients, high measure of responsibility and last bat not least not too much interesting salary is a levy paid for this surely very interesting, varied and useful work. It requires the individual to be highly responsible and concerned for his work but there are also considerable personal quality claims. There are o lot of obstacles and problems in the social worker's practice, which are difficult for him to solve and stressful. If he is not able to manage the stress reasonably some unpleasant mental and even physical consequences may appear.",

Although there have been inflow of efficient and feasible mental health therapies and programs and medical advances, nothing could be effective to reduce stigma. Stigma results in negative outcomes including difficulties with employment, poor social life and a decreased quality of life and self-esteem. Health care professionals and community people have to raise voices against stigma. Effective way of tackling mental illness stigmas are speaking out freely about mental disorders, avoid self-stigma, avoid labeling and discrimination, avoiding use of insolent language for mentally ill and get proper treatment. Poor mental health literacy and stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness is more among community members so there is need to prevent the mental illness stigma in community and educate the people regarding mental health and measures to tackle mental illness stigma.",

Through the years, the concept of ADLs has evolved to include a hierarchical classification from basic to more complex activities. Categorization of ADLs identifies if an activity is needed to sustain life, function within a community independently, or for the fulfillment of pleasurable activities and social roles. The three categories, basic, instrumental, and advanced ADLs, can be observed by a clinician to determine current functional status as well as independent living.

      "title": "Varieties of Executive Dysfunction in Autism.",
      "abstract": "This paper presents four studies which illustrate the variety of deficits in executive function displayed by individuals with autism. The concept of executive function is used to encompass all the mental operations which are involved in self-reflective and goal-directed behavior. Four forms of executive control are addressed: mental disengagement, coordination of two separate acts into a goal-directed temporal sequence, cognitive flexibility, and planning. The results of the first two studies indicate that subjects with autism are impaired in the processes required for learning behavioral strategies which involve a counter-intuitive or arbitrary association between response and target. The dysfunction may result from stuck in set perseveration, recurrent perseveration, or failure to sustain a plan of action in the absence of environmental cues. Results from the third study indicated a deficit in the processes required to shift attention from a salient dimension or category and engage attention upon a previously irrelevant stimulus. Results of the fourth study showed that subjects with autism are unable to find efficient solutions to planning problems which require a depth-first search to anticipate obstacles and the cognitive flexibility to change plans so as to avoid these obstacles.

As a result, all educational processes must be carried out according to a straight line determined by the holders and policymakers who are poor in creativity and innovation. Humans are actors or subjects. The vocation of a true human being is to be a conscious actor, who acts over the world and reality with a critical and creative attitude. In the cognitive realm, it has always been the foundation for measuring the level of success of the educational process. Even though the set of rules has demanded a balance of the three domains (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor) and even the spiritual realm, reality is far from expectations. The limitations of the competency skills of educators have always been endless reason. Various aspects of education: the characteristics of students, identifying cases, inhibiting and supporting factors in the implementation of education, and counseling guidance, this is what Paulo Freire offers to be an alternative development in the world of education.",

All individuals are intellectually endowed, but giftedness is perceived as an achievement in academic and practical intelligence as well as in the manipulation of wisdom-related skills and attitudes, taking into account nonintellective personal characteristics and contextual, sociocultural variables. Therefore, any attempt to measure intelligence should include multiple and diverse assessments comprising various psychological processes taking place in a specific time and place. Metacognitive processes are at the top of the hierarchy of cognition as their significance for one’s quality of life and social progress is immense and their existence signals for a successful person. Moreover, metacognition requires handling for a confluence of knowledge, feelings and skills in a balanced way; this is the point where individuals need to pay special attention in order to be both personally and socially successful as well as psychologically healthy.",

      "abstract": "Helping people acquire knowledge has a place in all strategies of health promotion regardless of whether the strategy is based on the Knowledge-Attitude-Behaviour model, the Empowerment model or the Community Action model. Knowledge is one class of belief the others being opinion, dogma and myth or fallacy. Knowledge differs from the other classes in that accepting it as true can be justified. However, in the field of diet and health and in most other fields of health promotion this distinction is difficult to make in practice. The difficulties of identifying knowledge are compounded when complex scientific observations are translated into simpler statements for use in health promotion. Whether a belief is true or false is irrelevant to us effect on behaviour. The extent to which beliefs (and particularly health beliefs) affect behaviour is variable but depends on their strength and precise relevance to the individual's behaviour. Attempts to measure knowledge reveal the underlying confusion in the minds of many health educators. Instruments which purport to measure knowledge frequently treat disputable propositions as 'knowledge' or cover items not relevant to behaviour. Knowledge measurements from such defective instruments lack validity. It is suggested that many difficulties could be avoided if health educators contented themselves with measuring 'beliefs' using opinion poll type instruments.",

However, as AI's reach extends, a paradox emerges: the more intelligent our machines become, the more significance our human-centered skills hold. In this era of exponential technological growth, soft skills; particularly empathy, emotional intelligence, adaptability, communication, and ethical reasoning have become essential.2 Soft skills more aptly described as “power skills,\" are typically defined as personal characteristics and emotional competencies that help individuals efficiently regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. In general terms, soft skills are the personality characteristics, attitudes, and social abilities that are intangible and more closely correlated with character characteristics and social skills than they are with technical proficiency.3 These include communication, creativity, emotional intelligence, and adaptability—skills that are becoming increasingly important in today's healthcare settings. Professionals that can successfully incorporate AI and cognitive technologies with human methods will be the most successful by 2030. AI will improve human capabilities rather than replace them. According to the World Economic Forum, by 2025, more than half of workers will require retraining, with an emphasis on soft skills to support technology improvements.4 AI excels at hard skills and automating mundane, time-consuming tasks but it falls short in areas like creativity, empathy, and human judgment. This is exactly where the very core behavioral skills come in, filling the gap and bringing human qualities that are essential for innovation and collaboration. Moreover, competencies like critical thinking facilitate the interpretation of results produced by AI and transform them into strategic decisions. Some essential soft skills for the era of AI include:",

The research of human intelligence includes a broad range of theories and a variety ofdifferent answers regarding most of the fundamental questions in the field, including thefollowing questions: What is the nature of intelligence? Is it a constant innate cognitive traitor is it a skill that can be improved? Is intelligence a single uniform entity or is it amultiplicity of independent abilities? What is the intelligence that most influences the degreeof success and in what fields?. The responses of most of the researchers depend largely on thetype of intelligence studied, as a result of a variety of approaches and schools –developmental, cognitive, psychometric, emotional-social, practical, and so on. In contrast,the starting point of this study is the success itself, with the goal to examine whether there isone ability that is shared by all those who succeed over time and whether and how it can beimproved - Since on the one hand, people with completely different abilities succeed inattaining significant achievements and on the other hand, only some people with similarabilities achieve lasting success. The main conclusion as examined during a decade ofcounseling and support of more than five hundred different people is that all those whoachieve ongoing success have a good level of ability in results-focused self-management –and this is results intelligence. The study shows that every individual has a different profile ofintelligences that includes his main abilities – and results intelligence is the ability to manageall the other abilities in favor of the achievement of the maximum results of success desiredover time.\r\n\r\nSince results intelligence is fundamentally a management ability and managementaddresses ways of thinking and doing and includes the ability to plan and implement a varietyof actions so as to achieve different goals, it exists in everybody, even if at different levels ofawareness, skill, or maximization. On the basis of the theory of management by objectivesfrom the approach of Professor Peter Drucker (as presented in the continuation) in life, as inbusiness, management is the factor that most influences the degree of success over time – andmanagement can be learned. Thus, it is possible to learn how to develop the level of resultsintelligence and thus to significantly improve the chances of reaching the maximum ofsuccess in a variety of areas of life. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create the modelof the development of results intelligence so as to enable individuals to identify their mainabilities and to learn how to leverage them and manage themselves, for the benefit of theachievement of their desired success and goals.",

      "abstract": "Affective learning outcomes are difficult to objectively analyse and assess as they refer to feelings and internal processes of the mind and heart. These cannot be quantified by traditional testing methods. The available methods rely on qualitative self-reflection and the observation of simple to complex internally consistent qualities of character. Just as in the other domains of learning, the validity and reliability of these assessments need to be ensured. The assessment of the affective domain requires careful observation of specified behaviours by multiple observers. Miller’s pyramid, Krathwohl’s levels and Epstein’s conceptual frameworks can be used to devise suitable assessment plans for the complex and varied competencies in this domain. Many techniques including paper-based tests, self-administered rating scale, faculty and peer assessment, simulations, reflections, portfolios, observed clinical encounters, collated views of co-workers, record of incidents of unprofessionalism, critical incident reports, patient surveys and global view of supervisor have been used for assessment of affective domain. The effective utilization of these assessment tools needs to factor in the ground realities that exist in different medical colleges. The acceptability and feasibility of using resource intensive assessment methods needs to be carefully balanced against their contributions towards increasing validity and reliability",

      "abstract": "The study of the problem of emotional stability of a future educational psychologist’s personality is relevant due to the number of reasons: the insufficiency of knowledge, the need for professionals with emotional stability and capacity for its development. The emotional stability as an integrative property of an individual is important for educational psychologists. The emotional stability of an individual still is not clearly defined and there is no general understanding of the structure, criteria, mechanisms, and conditions of development. This paper presents the brief analysis of the psychological study of the emotional stability; its components, criteria, indicators and their correlation, as well as the results of empirical research aimed at the study of the manifestations of specific characteristics of emotional stability. Any personal characteristic affecting the emotional sphere can be a continuum; from the lowest level to the highest, from negative to positive. The criteria and indicators highlighted in the paper are considered within the indicated continuum: motivational criterion (low motivation – high motivation); cognitive criterion (knowledge completeness – deficient knowledge and lack of system); emotional criterion (emotional passivity – emotional excitement); volitional criterion (feeling of helplessness, lack of skills of self-control – overconfidence, self-control); communication criteria (communicative passivity – communicative aggressiveness). In the result of the empirical study, the authors identified three differentiated groups of students – future educational psychologists according to the domination of the development of one, two, or three criteria. In the “dominance of one criterion” group, the dominance of communicative criterion (18.58 %) is most often observed; in the “dominance of two criteria” group, the predominance of volitional and emotional criteria (7.08 %) is most often represented; in the “dominance of three criteria” group, the combination of communicative, emotional and volitional criteria (1.77 %) is represented.",

      "title": "Developing loneliness interventions for people with personality disorders: A call to action",
      "abstract": "Abstract Loneliness is common in personality disorders (PDs) and may contribute to their severity and persistence. Systematic research on loneliness interventions for PD is sparse but clearly needed. According to the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders, loneliness may be related to personality functioning and may link to domains of self (identity and self‐direction) and interpersonal functioning (empathy and intimacy). A deeper understanding of the interaction between perceived loneliness and individual dysfunction across these domains is essential for establishing novel psychological interventions that effectively treat loneliness. As a first step in developing a valid therapy model, we suggest a modular framework that encompasses loneliness‐associated perceptions, cognitions, feelings, and behaviors that can be targeted with specific strategies. To further develop this framework, additional empirical research, for example, clinical studies on loneliness‐tailored interventions in PD, should be performed in parallel with more conceptual research that challenges and integrates current hypotheses and theories.",

The more one tries to know subtle world, the more enigmatic and mysterious it becomes, the reach of human mind is indeed infinite but the mental complexities generated thereby have not only hindered and hampered the elevation of personality, but also have shaken and cracked its inner structure and stability. In professional youths between the age group of 20-24 years lots of psychological imbalances arise due to emotional immaturity and lack of knowledge of inner self. Spirituality with mindful meditation along with positive attitude is the only way through which one can get well soon from all types of problems by following some discipline. “Mental health connotates those behaviors, perceptions and feelings that determines a person’s overall level of personal effectiveness, success, happiness and excellence of functioning as a person.” Thus the present study shows that mindful meditation practices help to reduce the stress level in daily life.",

      "abstract": "Psychology is in the early stages of examining a crisis of replicability stemming from several high-profile failures to replicate studies in experimental psychology. This important conversation has largely been focused on social psychology, with some active participation from cognitive psychology. Nevertheless, several other major domains of psychological science—including clinical science—have remained insulated from this discussion. The goals of this article are to (a) examine why clinical psychology and allied fields, such as counseling and school psychology, have not been central participants in the replicability conversation; (b) review concerns and recommendations that are less (or more) applicable to or appropriate for research in clinical psychology and allied fields; and (c) generate take-home messages for scholars and consumers of the literature in clinical psychology and allied fields, as well as reviewers, editors, and colleagues from other areas of psychological science.",

      "title": "Social Cognition in Schizophrenia: From Social Stimuli Processing to Social Engagement",
      "abstract": "Social cognition consists of several skills which allow us to interact with other humans. These skills include social stimuli processing, drawing inferences about others' mental states, and engaging in social interactions. In recent years, there has been growing evidence of social cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Apparently, these impairments are separable from general neurocognitive impairments, such as attention, memory and executive functioning. Moreover, social cognition seems to be a main determinant of functional outcome and could be used as a guide to elaborate new pharmacological and psychological treatments. However, most of these studies focus on individual mechanisms and observational perspectives; only few of them study schizophrenic patients during interactive situations. We first review evidences of social cognitive impairments both in social stimuli processing and in mental state attribution. We focus on the relationship between these functions and both general cognitive impairments and functional outcome. We next review recent game theory approaches to the study of how social engagement occurs in schizophrenic patients. The advantage of using game theory is that game-oriented tasks can assess social decision-making in an interactive everyday situation model. Finally, we review proposed theoretical models used to explain social alterations and their underlying biological mechanisms. Based on interactive studies, we propose a framework which takes into account the dynamic nature of social processes. Thus, understanding social skills as a result of dynamical systems could facilitate the development of both basic research and clinical applications oriented to psychiatric populations.",

Emotion schemas, the most frequently occurring emotion experiences, are dynamic emotion-cognition interactions that may consist of momentary/situational responding or enduring traits of personality that emerge over developmental time. Emotions play a critical role in the evolution of consciousness and the operations of all mental processes. Types of emotion relate differentially to types or levels of consciousness. Unbridled imagination and the ability for sympathetic regulation of empathy may represent both potential gains and losses from the evolution and ontogeny of emotion processes and consciousness. Unresolved issues include psychology's neglect of levels of consciousness that are distinct from access or reflective consciousness and use of the term “unconscious mind” as a dumpster for all mental processes that are considered unreportable. The relation of memes and the mirror neuron system to empathy, sympathy, and cultural influences on the development of socioemotional skills are unresolved issues destined to attract future research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: The concept “quality of life” is becoming increasingly popular in both the medical and general press. However, from a literature survey of approximately 100 scientific publications in which this concept was used, it appeared that rarely is a definition of this term given. Therefore, it seems useful to formulate several guiding principles: (1) “Quality of life” apparently is too vague a concept. It seems more sensible to isolate a number of relevant factors and to choose the best operational definition possible. The following factors may be considered: daily activity, pattern of complaints, subjective feeling of well‐being, and sexual behavior. Based upon these factors one composite score of psychological and social consequences should be developed, analogous to an IQ test. (2) The patient is the sole authority concerning questions on “quality of life.” (3) The concept “quality of life” should indicate more than a person's momentary well being, since this is dependent on mood, physiologic state, accidental events, etc. It is not the situation at one specific point which should be considered but the situation over a certain period . (4) Questions concerning “quality of life” should be put relatively. For example, does a person have more or less complaints during one period as compared to another? A second possibility is to compare a person's answers to those of a carefully chosen control group. It is essential to keep in mind that these psychologic measures are descriptive; they indicate how patients feel during a certain period concerning the above‐mentioned areas and are definitely nor normative in the sense of stating what is or is not desirable.",

This paper stresses the importance of self-esteem as a protective factor and a non-specific risk factor in physical and mental health. Evidence is presented illustrating that self-esteem can lead to better health and social behavior, and that poor self-esteem is associated with a broad range of mental disorders and social problems, both internalizing problems (e.g. depression, suicidal tendencies, eating disorders and anxiety) and externalizing problems (e.g. violence and substance abuse). We discuss the dynamics of self-esteem in these relations. It is argued that an understanding of the development of self-esteem, its outcomes, and its active protection and promotion are critical to the improvement of both mental and physical health. The consequences for theory development, program development and health education research are addressed. Focusing on self-esteem is considered a core element of mental health promotion and a fruitful basis for a broad-spectrum approach.",

      "abstract": "Pembimbing : (1) Dra. Siti Suminarti, M.Si.\r\n\r\n(2) M. Salis Yuniardi, S. Psi. M.Psi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnak-anak adalah masa-masa bermain, proses mereka belajar tentang sesuatu yang baru melalui sebuah permainan. Dalam permainan, seorang anak akan dapat berpikir mengenai apa yang harus dilakukan dalam menyelesaikan suatu konflik. Akan tetapi yang menjadi masalah adalah ketika anak memiliki kepribadian yang berbeda dari anak-anak pada umumnya, anak tersebut dapat dikatakan telah memiliki gangguan jika telah memenuhi kriteria dari gangguan itu sendiri. Misalnya gangguan pemusatan perhatian atau ADHD, dan gangguan tingkah laku.\r\n\r\nAnak ADHD tersebut memerlukan pendidikan dengan guru yang dapat memikul tanggung jawab yang sangat besar, ia dituntut untuk mampu mampu memilih, menentukan, dan mengembangkan model dan bentuk-bentuk evaluasi kemajuan belajar yang cocok atau sesuai bagi siswa ADHD. Ketika guru SLB tidak memiliki kesabaran dan ketelatenan dalam melakukan pengajaran, guru tersebut akan rentan mengalami stres karena kegiatan tersebut berhubungan dengan gangguan kognitif, fungsional dan perilaku yang dialami oleh penderita. Menurut Lazarus dkk (1994) coping atau cara mengurangi stres mempunyai dua macam fungsi yaitu emotion focused coping dan problem focused coping. Metode dan strategi coping juga harus sesuai dengan stres yang dialami agar coping tersebut menjadi efektif. Jika coping yang dilakukan berhasil maka keadaan stres dan stressor dapat ditekan.\r\n\r\nPenelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian kualitatif berjenis deskriptif dengan subyek berjumlah 4 orang dengan klasifikasi tertentu yaitu guru SLB yang mengalami stres berdasarkan gejala-gejala yang diramalkan ketika mengajar anak ADHD dan memiliki coping yang ditunjukkan melalui cheklist. Selanjutnya pengambilan data yaitu dengan metode wawancara tidak terstruktur dengan menggunakan pedoman umum wawancara.\r\n\r\nDidalam penelitian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa penyebab stres terdapat dua faktor yaitu faktor internal dan faktor eksternal. Faktor internal ditunjukkan adanya perasaan jenuh, marah dan jengkel pada anak ADHD. Hal tersebut muncul karena subyek merasa tidak mampu untuk menanganinya dan merasa kurang memiliki strategi lain untuk mengajar anak ADHD. Faktor eksternal yang menyebabkan munculnya stres adalah ketatnya aturan yang ada disekolah dan ketua yayasan yang terlalu menuntut agar pekerjaan guru tersebut dapat memenuhi target. Hal tersebut membuat subyek merasa sangat tertekan dan bingung harus bersikap seperti apa. Selain itu masalah-masalah yang ada dalam rumah subyek kadang-kadang juga membuat subyek merasa terbebani.\r\n\r\nOleh karena itu ketika menangani stresnya guru SLB yang mengajar anak ADHD tersebut lebih dominan menggunakan strategi emotion focused coping yang mengacu pada approach strategies yaitu dengan cara berintrospeksi diri dan belajar dari kesalahan yang sudah terjadi. Adapun problem focused coping juga digunakan oleh subyek yaitu dengan cara mencari cara lain untuk menangani anak ADHD dan secara langsung mendekati anak ADHD dengan cara yang pelan. Akan tetapi strategi ini jarang digunakan oleh subyek penelitian.",

      "abstract": "Substantial evidence suggests that mind-wandering typically occurs at a significant cost to performance. Mind-wandering-related deficits in performance have been observed in many contexts, most notably reading, tests of sustained attention, and tests of aptitude. Mind-wandering has been shown to negatively impact reading comprehension and model building, impair the ability to withhold automatized responses, and disrupt performance on tests of working memory and intelligence. These empirically identified costs of mind-wandering have led to the suggestion that mind-wandering may represent a pure failure of cognitive control and thus pose little benefit. However, emerging evidence suggests that the role of mind-wandering is not entirely pernicious. Recent studies have shown that mind-wandering may play a crucial role in both autobiographical planning and creative problem solving, thus providing at least two possible adaptive functions of the phenomenon. This article reviews these observed costs and possible functions of mind-wandering and identifies important avenues of future inquiry.",

Of professionals working in specific conditions, sanguine and choleric temperament types are characteristic, and much less phlegmatic and melancholic ones.

In occupations where activities are connected with unexpectedly emerging problems’ management, availability is due to firm nervous system, these specialists are not so likely to commit accidents, errors, as they man in these situations. The overall structure of the personality of the person carrying out work in special conditions can be summarized as a set of mental processes (cognitive, emotional, volitional); mental properties (character, temperament, directivity, abilities: adaptive, predictive, communicative ones, etc.); of mental states (satisfaction vs dissatisfaction, activity, enthusiasm, cheerfulness, depression, passivity); of mental formations (knowledge, skills, abilities, habits) which interact with the situation, while the role of the latter varies depending on its type and trained state of a specialist.",

      "abstract": "An important condition of the effective process of professional personal development is professional self-consciousness. It manifests in various forms related to the cognitive, emotional and volitional aspects of human mental activity.The educating process of professional self-consciousness is complicated and controversial. It involves many factors, the action of which can often lead to opposite consequences.The purpose of the article is a theoretical analysis of the structural components of professional self-consciousness, definition of the formational stages and evaluation criteria.Professional self-consciousness is a complex mental formation of a person, which is self-awareness of involvement in the profession, encourages professional self-realization and orients the person to active work in the professional field.We can distinguish three stages of professional self-consciousness formation: the stage of early professional self-consciousness that develops during the game (childhood), adolescent professional self-consciousness, characterized by prioritization in choosing future profession (middle and senior school age) and the stage of mature professional self-consciousness (university period, professional activity).The formation of professional self-consciousness at these stages is quite conditional because not every child has professional preferences. Every person following appropriate work can simultaneously form traits that reflect the characteristics of different stages of professional self-consciousness.We can distinguish three main criteria of different levels of professional students self-consciousness: cognitive, motivational-valued and activity-practical, which reveals the presence or absence of certain features that characterize professional self-consciousness.These criteria for assessing the levels of professional self-consciousness make possibility to establish the degree of presence of certain personality traits that are indicators of professional self-consciousness of each phenomenon component: a personʼs attitude to the profession, attitude to himself as a subject, to colleagues, to the object of labour.&#x0D; Keywords: self-consciousness; professional self-consciousness; structural components; formation system; stages of formation; self-awareness; evaluation criteria; levels of development; performance indicators.",

      "title": "Building Emotional Resilience at the Workplace",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONStress happens, and it happens to everyone. If workers do not have emotional resilience skills and habits to help support them during these times, their productivity declines. Work-related requirements such as precision and accuracy, problem solving, interpersonal communications, as well as speed and quality of work output will suffer. This general state may be considered part of presenteeism, which is typical when workers are demoralized, distracted, overwhelmed, or otherwise not coping well with stress. It is important to note that the stressors may be from work-related or personal issues, but frequently, stress in one sphere is accompanied by stress in the other. The good thing is that skills to maintain emotional resilience are effective across all settings, and these habits get stronger with use. EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE DEFINED Emotional resilience is the capacity to adjust to change, disruption, or difficulty while maintaining good functional capacities. Employees who have high emotional resilience are those who, when presented with stress (either work related or personal) can bounce back, bend without breaking, and cope without giving in, giving up, or breaking down. Emotional resilience is a skill that can be taught and learned, but to be effective, these skills need to be practiced and incorporated into a healthy lifestyle and a healthy work style.SOME STATISTICS ON EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE Clearly, we like to save our paid time off for fun, but when we are highly stressed, we dependably go to work and probably experience the employee perspective on presenteeism. To illustrate this point, consider these statistics: Gallup’s (1) global surveys on self-reported stress categorize results into three levels or zones of functioning, thriving, struggling, and suffering. In a report of these trends of workplace-specific data by nation, the United States was characterized as 56% thriving, 41% struggling, and 3% suffering. The reality of what life throws at us is captured by a poll that finds in the past year that 49% of all American adult respondents had at least one major stressor. The most prevalent was a major illness or injury, followed by death of a loved one, and the third most prevalent was problems at work (3). It is easy to imagine a “thriving” employee suddenly falling into the “struggling” category through a serious illness or injury or through the death of a loved one. None of us is immune to the reality of our lives. Lost productivity because of sick days varies among workers based on their stress zone. An average sick day in the United States is worth about $200 per day to employers. People who fall into the “suffering” category on an annual per-person basis cost $28,000 because of lost productivity and work days (i.e., the equivalent of 140 lost days). For those in the “struggling” zone, the cost is $6,168 (i.e., the equivalent of 61.8 lost days); and for those high in the “thriving” category, the lost productivity caused by sick days is only $840 (i.e., the equivalent of 4.2 lost days) (4). When polled, one of the least likely things that Americans who have been under “a great deal of stress in the past month” actually do is take time off from work. When under a great deal of stress, the three least likely actions are (3): ○ To take time off from work. ○ Engage paid service for household help. ○ Follow a formal self-help program. MANAGING ILLNESS OR ACHIEVING BEST SELF? From an employer’s perspective, what approach should be considered when making decisions on how best to apply resources to address worker stress and emotional resilience? Should an employer wait for negative consequences to occur and manage them at that time or proactively strive to prevent such negative outcomes, thus optimizing worker health, well-being, and achievement of their best selves? At HealthPartners, a not-for-profit, member-governed, integrated health system headquartered in Minnesota that serves more than 1.4 million health insurance members and more than 1.2 million patients, a proactive and intentional strategy has been deployed to address emotional resilience for its 22,500 employees. The strategy is applied to employees and to plan members because all employees live, work, and play in the same communities as the overall membership. Figure 1 illustrates the emotional resilience components of well-being, with resources and tools for those who are thriving, struggling, or suffering, which are available to HealthPartners members and employees. A description of the resources provided follows.Figure 1: Helping employees achieve their best self through emotional resilience.DESCRIPTION OF RESOURCES ACROSS THE STRESS ZONES Thriving and Struggling Zones As depicted in Figure 1, for those in the “thriving” zone and those just into the “struggling” zone, there are individual phone coaching and group coaching options from either health promotion professionals or behavioral health professionals depending on the topic. Similar to health promotion professionals who coach on topics of physical activity, healthy eating, sleep, and milder levels of stress reduction, behavioral health professionals take the lead when the topics are high levels of stress or the application of cognitive behavioral therapy. After completing an annual health assessment, the behavioral health professionals reach out to employees with the highest levels of stress, emotional health concerns, or chemical health issues to conduct at least three individual telephone consultations. The goal of these consultations is to identify those who may benefit from self-help resources and those who need professional face-to-face consultation with a mental health or chemical health professional. Self-help resources and guided learning resources available for employees include three-session group coaching programs called Healthy Thinking©, Healthy Communication©, and Social Connectedness©, as well as similarly structured group coaching sessions on physical activity and healthy eating. Online virtual coaching makes access to resources that address topics such as positive thinking, stress management, and healthy sleep available to a workforce that staffs six hospitals, several urgent care centers, and other 24/7 operations such as information technology help desks. These options also allow those who prefer online learning to access content in their preferred modality. One online option is an evidence-based program developed in England and used in the National Health Service during the past 14 years called Beating the Blues™. The program consists of eight 30-minute sessions that teach cognitive behavioral skills and supplies structured practice between sessions. It features video clips of five characters who describe and focus on how to deal with their life stressors. Beating the Blues™ teaches that what we think has a major impact on how we feel emotionally. Thinking things that are literally true helps mood regulation and better individual functioning and resilience. Challenging our assumptions and addressing negative self-talk is a major part of this program. After each session, participants have the option to hear how any of the characters did in their own practice. Because these video clips are only “earned” through session completion, this type of reward offers a kind of social connectedness that helps participants feel more supported. Mental health and chemical health conditions undermine emotional resilience through mood dysregulation. Some employees or their immediate family members need more support and guidance if they have a condition that undermines emotional resilience. HealthPartners provides an array of mental health and chemical health resources to those who may be in the “struggling” zone. On Your Way©, Moving Forward©, and Step by Step© are condition self-management programs designed to educate, encourage, and provide prompts and reminders related to treatment options for those with any of three sets of conditions (depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, and chemical dependency). Typically, about 12% of employees will have at least one of these conditions in any given year. Suffering Zone In 2003, HealthPartners created predictive analytics to identify those who without intervention are at high risk for future psychiatric crises and hospitalization because of complex mental or chemical health conditions or coexisting behavioral health conditions. Behavioral health professionals reach out and engage such persons and help educate them about their conditions, coordinate care, and create crisis plans through provider networks and community crisis options planning, intervention, and support. With participant permission, behavioral health professionals engage with the participant in three-way phone calls with supportive family or friends to answer questions and encourage healthy engagement. ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA Mental health stigma remains pervasive in the general population. Stigma reduces the chances that all receive the treatments they need. HealthPartners teamed up with the Minnesota chapter of National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and Twin Cities Public Television to create the award-winning Make It OK© campaign to address mental health stigma for employees, members, and community at-large. This campaign is supported by a Web site, www.MakeItOK.org, four half-hour programs created by Twin Cities Public TV, a speaker’s bureau, and engaging online interactive content that allows viewers to get to know real Minnesotans who have learned to live well with mental illnesses. Online organizational readiness toolkits that support employers, faith and civic communities, as well as health care providers and public health services are available to support implementation of the Make It OK© resources. SUPPORT FOR MANAGERS AND LEADERS In addition to a wide variety of content to support employee emotional resilience, HealthPartners provides training and tools for managers, directors, and executives on resilience. In 2014, the company included instruction and experience training on emotional resilience for approximately 5,000 leaders. An introduction to emotional resilience resources is included in new employee and new leader orientation that range from simple prompts and reminders (e.g., see Figure 2) to the ongoing available supports described above.Figure 2: Prompting for emotional resilience.CASE STUDY: WHAT CAN AN EMPLOYER DO TO BUILD EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE? Program Description As part of a comprehensive worksite well-being program, HealthPartners offers Emotional Resilience group coaching to employees. In 2013, and again in 2014, two related group coaching series were offered: Healthy Thinking© and Healthy Communication©. Both programs are designed to build skills intended to reduce stress and improve how individuals think and feel. Healthy Thinking© teaches participants to recognize negative self-talk and replace it with thoughts that are literally true. Healthy Communication© teaches participants to recognize their poor communication skills and replace them with good communication skills. These programs may be considered a “stress inoculation,” strategy, or a means of helping employees develop the skills to cope with stress effectively and prevent the impacts of unmanaged stress, such as irritability and listlessness. Program Participants This project was designed to measure 1-year outcomes resulting from participation in either emotional resilience coaching option offered at HealthPartners. As part of HealthPartners BeWell employee health and well-being program, the two coaching programs were available to all employees at HealthPartners corporate offices in the fall of 2013. Each series consisted of three 1-hour sessions. The programs were promoted with building-wide emails and flyers. A total of 83 employees participated in the emotional resilience offerings in 2013. Participants were predominantly female (85%), with an average age of 48 years. Outcomes associated with emotional resilience were measured using the Health Assessment (HA) available to employees. The HA is an online self-reported questionnaire that assesses a comprehensive set of self-reported health factors, provides personalized feedback, and connects participants to well-being program options. Collected before the start of the emotional resilience programs and again after 1 year, the HA results of program participants were evaluated relative to a comparison group of employees who did not participate in a well-being program in 2013 (N = 308). Outcome Measures The HA assesses a variety of health factors and is summarized by an overall 1,000-point score called the Total Health Potential Score (THPS). The THPS has a maximum of 1,000 points consisting of three subscores: the Modifiable Health Potential Score (MHPS), the Quality of Life Score (QOLS), and the Non-Modifiable Health Potential Score. All health potential scores are designed so that achievement of a higher score reflects better health (2). In this study, we tested the impact of resiliency coaching on THPS, MHPS, and QOLS. Also tested was the program’s impact on the Health Risk 10 Score (RISK10). The RISK10 consists of 10 risk factors known to influence the health of individuals. Because this measure is designed to reflect risk, the achievement of a lower score reflects better health (i.e., less risk). Emotional health concerns were measured using the question: “During the past 4 weeks, to what extent have you accomplished less than you would like in your work or other daily activities as a result of emotional problems, such as feeling depressed or anxious?” Questions related to life and job satisfaction also were considered: “In general, how satisfied are you with your life?” and “How satisfied are you with your current job?” Analysis For continuous outcomes, paired t tests were used to analyze change scores between baseline and follow-up for both resiliency coaching participants and the comparison group, respectively. For categorical outcomes, McNemar tests were used to analyze changes in the response distributions between baseline and follow-up. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Participants in resiliency coaching experienced positive outcomes as measured by several summary scores. These included notable improvements in THPS (+4.5) and MHPS (+10.1) and reductions in RISK10 (-0.2), although only the MHPS showed statistical significance (Figure 3). In addition, both life satisfaction (+0.09) and job satisfaction (+0.2) improved among participants in resiliency coaching. No statistically significant differences were observed among the comparison group from baseline to follow-up. See Table for a complete listing of results.Figure 3: Modifiable health factors.TABLE 1: Preprogram to Postprogram Change for the Healthy Thinking and Healthy Communication CoursesKEY TAKE-AWAYS Among employees, Gallup poll indicators note that, at any given time, 56% are thriving, 41% are struggling, and 3% are suffering. However, at any given time, anyone — even those who are thriving — may experience a major stressor that puts them at risk for struggling. In fact, 49% of employees indicate that they had a major stressor in the past year and 26% “had a great deal of stress.” Whereas high-quality treatment and support options for those with depression and severe mental illness need to be available, building the capacity for high resilience responses allows employees to achieve their best self. Group coaching for emotional resilience can be highly effective for employees not only to bring their best self to work but also to be their best self at home and in the community. Employers can address mental health stigma through community-based partnerships that leverage multiple stakeholders’ interests. Three group coaching sessions were shown to have significant positive impacts on modifiable health factors at 1 year. In addition, notable improvements in job satisfaction and life satisfaction were recorded among employees of a large integrated health system.",

      "title": "Treatment or Accommodation for Adults With Challenging Behaviors",
      "abstract": "When an adult with developmental disabilities is referred for a significant behavior problem such as aggression, oppositional behavior, self-abuse, or destructiveness, it is customary practice in residential care settings to develop and implement a behavioral treatment plan that involves a number of interrelated steps. Typically, a history is taken to determine the strength of the behavior, circumstances related to its occurrence, and past efforts to treat it. Next, presently occurring and potentially contributing physical factors are addressed and ruled out to the extent possible by referral to appropriate medical professionals. The present status of the individual is then assessed through (a) direct observation in the individual’s natural environment; (b) interviews with the individual, when appropriate, and staff members, family, or others familiar with the person; and (c) relevant testing (e.g., as an evaluation of cognitive and adaptive skills and screening for psychopathology, Alzheimer’s disease, or other disorders) and identifying reinforcer preferences. A detailed functional analysis follows to obtain a baseline of the challenging behavior and to identify possible related environmental factors. At this point, internal factors that may be contributing to the problem behaviors as well as relevant psychiatric diagnoses are considered and, when appropriate, a referral is made for a consultation and possible medical management of the disorder. Finally, a behavioral treatment plan appropriate to the individual’s developmental level is designed and implemented, including appropriate staff training and monitoring. Typically, treatment programs involve procedures to reinforce behaviors incompatible with the challenging behavior and to apply least restrictive consequences for the referral problem. Broadly speaking, the objective of behavioral treatment is to make systematic changes in the individual’s environment, including antecedents and consequences, that will support the individual as new adaptive behaviors are learned and old problem behaviors are reduced and ultimately extinguished. The long-term goal of behavioral treatment is to have the individual maintain behavioral gains in the absence of continued treatment. The final outcome should be an improved quality of life for the person in treatment as well as the other residents and staff members whom this individual encounters on a daily basis. The professional literature is replete with studies that document the effectiveness of behavioral treatment programs, and practitioners can easily cite numerous successful treatment cases of their own. However, not all individuals with challenging behaviors experience positive treatment outcomes. We all have cases that despite our best efforts do not respond well to behavioral treatment and for some, they actually become worse. A number of factors contribute to poorer outcomes among individuals with developmental disabilities, including chronological age, a long history of problem behaviors, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, medical complications, and an intractable treatment record. The purpose of this perspective is to suggest an alternative to traditional behavioral treatment programs that we have experienced good success with over the past 10 years. We call this approach accommo",

      "abstract": "The concept of professional competence stands as the paramount criterion in the education and training of future experts. It is this competence that fundamentally determines the effectiveness and success of their professional endeavors. Professional competence is not a static or simple attribute; rather, it is an integrated, multifaceted, and dynamic construct. This construct encompasses a broad spectrum of elements, including but not limited to, a deep well of knowledge, a diverse set of abilities, and a wide range of skills. However, the scope of professional competence extends beyond these technical aspects. It also includes personal capabilities, such as emotional intelligence and adaptability, as well as indicators of general culture, which reflect a person's broad educational background and understanding of the world. At the core of professional competence lies the concept of professional suitability. This term refers to a combination of various mental and psychophysiological traits that a person possesses. These traits are crucial as they underpin the individual's ability to perform their professional duties effectively. In addition to these innate qualities, professional suitability also involves communication skills and specific competencies necessary for excelling in one's professional life. A significant direction for future research is the development of a comprehensive model that outlines the process of forming and enhancing the professional competence of pharmacists. This research could provide valuable insights into how educational programs can be structured to better prepare students for their future careers. Furthermore, the role of research and teaching staff in shaping the professional competencies of higher education applicants is an area of great importance. These educators play a pivotal role in guiding and nurturing the next generation of professionals, ensuring they are well-equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to succeed in their respective fields. This comprehensive approach to understanding and developing professional competence is crucial for the advancement of various professions and the effective functioning of health care society.",

      "abstract": "Interpersonal dependency—the tendency to look to others for nurturance, guidance, protection, and support, even in situations where autonomous functioning is possible—has become associated with passivity, immaturity, and dysfunction in the minds of mental health professionals. However, research suggests that dependent persons behave quite actively—even aggressively—in certain contexts. Although dependency is associated with certain forms of dysfunction (e.g., perpetration of domestic violence when close relationships are threatened), it is also linked with an array of adaptive behaviors (e.g., conscientiousness in complying with medical and psychotherapeutic treatment regimens). The cognitive/interactionist (C/I) model of interpersonal dependency provides a framework for understanding contextual variations in dependency-related responding: Although dependent behaviors vary from situation to situation based on perceived opportunities and risks, the dependent person’s core beliefs (a perception of oneself as helpless and weak) and motives (a desire to strengthen ties to potential caregivers) remain constant. Here I discuss theoretical and practical implications of the C/I model and summarize current trends in research on interpersonal dependency.",

Mental health patients with higher levels of self-stigma tend to have much lower self-esteem, efficacy, and personal agency; therefore, they will be more inclined to adopt role-identities at the periphery of major social institutions, like those of work, family, and academia. Similarly, the emotions felt when enacting such roles may be similarly dampened.",

We review the research that has linked mindfulness training to improved emotional intelligence in this chapter. Skills like self-restraint, empathy, and effective communication are included in this group. The article explores the potential applications of mindfulness activities in enhancing emotional intelligence. In addition to discussing the benefits of mindfulness for emotional regulation and social awareness, the essay explores how readers might incorporate the practice into their daily lives. Empirical data and case studies in many settings, such as businesses, classrooms, and personal relationships, demonstrate the real-world effects of integrating mental agility with emotional intelligence.",

Academic self-concept is influenced by students' comparisons to themselves (internal frame of reference) and to others (external frame of reference). Being a member of a homogeneous high-ability peer group is associated with declines in academic self-concept (big-fish-little-pond effect). Academic self-concept is extensively studied using a variety of rigorous methods (i.e., meta-analysis, structural equation modelling, experimental-control design) and has good intercultural generalisability. Due to the role of academic self-concept in students' achievement and motivational outcomes, educational interventions should take into account mechanisms that foster positive academic self-concept.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the analysis of child development in the digital world is associated with identifying the range of negative substitutions. Functional substitution shows that an active role belongs to the gadget. A child performs a passive role, receiving full navigation, “wired” in the gadget. Digital interaction forms reactive behavior according to the logic “stimulus - new temptation”. Social substitution is caused by copying a fi nished scheme set by the algorithm. There is no need for joint action, which is a criterion of sociality. Replacing the adult fi gure with a gadget generates a digital loneliness. The child fi nds himself “beyond” the joint work and social obligations, the installation of communication is blocked. The shift of the semantic event center is due to the fact that the child, being in virtual environment, experiences events as real and value-signifi cant. The fact is that gadget-independent motivation and goal-setting disappear. Scenario capture demonstrates the effect of total immersion. In the digital world, the priority scenario of behavior is initially set by algorithms. The convenience and effi ciency of the gadget teach the child to take ready-made schemes of action, giving rise to the illusion of development. Results. In the process of digital interiorization, several types of substitutions have been identifi ed, including functional, social, semantic and scenario capture. They are dangerous with negative effects that deform the development of the child, the cognitive and psycho-mental structure of a personality. The fi nal effect of digital substitutions is the social immaturity of the child in the world of real object-activity relations. Conclusion. The identifi ed substitutions can be evaluated as a part of the global technology aimed at algorithmization of behavioral patterns. There is an acute need for the return of the adult fi gure and the increasing algorithmic responsibility of software developers.",

      "abstract": "After diagnosis of a skin disorder, there follows a period of psychological adjustment during which most people are able to cope. Coping is a process that can be described as ‘expending conscious effort to solve personal and interpersonal problems, and seeking to master, minimise or tolerate a stressor’. Many types of coping strategies are possible, including planning; positive re-interpretation; using practical and emotional social support; venting of emotions; suppression of competing activities; emotional, behavioural and cognitive disengagement; and use of humour or religion. Several methods may be used and the methods used may change; skills are used or developed to regain a sense of equilibrium and well-being. Exploring ways of coping can be useful and an assessment tool such as The Brief COPE Questionnaire can help in this regard. Some people appear to cope well and adjust quickly despite an objectively severe skin disease, while others may become very stressed and struggle to cope in the face of an objectively minor skin disorder. Psychological adjustment is a multifactorial and fluctuant biopsychosocial process which centres around three themes: a search for meaning in the experience; an attempt to regain control over the situation and in life generally; and an effort to restore self-esteem.",

      "title": "Publishing addiction: a behavioural disorder with specific characteristics",
      "abstract": "By reading an academic journal, you are already at high risk of publishing addiction (PA). So, read on and see if you have it. PA is proposed as a previously unreported behavioural addiction. Gambling, excessive smartphone use and unrestrained shopping are other behavioural 'addictions'.1, 2 Although widespread, PA is masked by its normalization within academia, as alcoholism may be accepted in a brewery. PA can greatly impact the lives of those in its grip. The distinguishing features of PA include an urgent desire to keep publishing, getting emotional kicks from various publishing stages, including seeing your name in print, devoting excessive time to the habit, imagining that your articles are important, deluding yourself that your articles are actually read, blaming others when your articles get rejected and creating behaviours and strategies to support the habit. PA has several characteristics in common with other behavioural addictions. These include a lack of insight or denial, an inability to stop the behaviour, and delayed gratification. There may be damage to oneself and family and giving up of some social activities. Repeated rituals may develop, such as frequently checking citations and H-index on Google Scholar. The classic drug addict strategy of keeping a steady supply of the drug is echoed by constantly having several articles at various stages of publication. Some publishing addicts even start their own journal.3 Minor features of PA include constantly being on the outlook to publish even very minor issues (such as 'Antecubital fossae petechiae in Scottish country dancers')4 and performing publishing tricks, such as breaking the record for the shortest publication (two words).5 Time wasted on these multiple small pursuits could be better spent on grant applications and research leading to fewer, more important publications. Other PA features include developing coping strategies: using an exhaustive 'response to referee' method that leaves an editor with little room to reject, and viewing rejection as evidence of the article being 'an idea before its time' and one step closer to eventual acceptance. Warning signs of PA might include publishing more than 10 articles per year or having more than 100 publications. PA has similarities with alcohol addiction. Most drinkers occasionally have an enjoyable drink, but a few develop alcoholism. But while alcoholism is almost universally negative, PA often also brings positive benefits. It turbocharges spreading your ideas, and may lead to peer recognition, promotion, invitations to lecture or advise, and to stimulating academic encounters. Your career may flourish and go from success to success. But PA can lead to ruin, through salami publications, duplicate publications, plagiarism and fabricated results. In the academic publishing business model, the author does all the work, gifts it to the publisher, and then has to pay to make it widely available. Potato growers wouldn't put up with such an absurd offer from a supermarket. But academic authors accept this outrageous situation allegedly because they want to disseminate their research, to enhance their CVs, and because employers require them to publish. For many, however, the real underlying reason is to feed their PA. My interactions with the BJD, coupled with my PA, have included being the British Association of Dermatologists' Treasurer (BJD income being critically important), being President and trying to restructure editorial arrangements, being on the Editorial Board and refereeing, but my main involvement has been as author. As addicts trying to manipulate the supplier, our team members have tried to 'use' the BJD to help develop our quality-of-life measures, partially successfully. And, on leaving my office window open, even the Cardiff birds with PA chose my BJDs to nest on (Figure 1). How might PA insights help the editors of a major journal, such as the BJD? Top-ranking authors are likely to have PA. The BJD wants to attract top-ranking authors. If you understand what gives these authors their big kicks, you can develop and enhance these, creating journal ecstasy. Then you've got them! Journals already flaunt their glitzy impact factors on their websites to suck in authors, much as casinos attract gamblers with their gaudy surroundings. But they could do better. The highs of PA include receiving an acceptance email (parallels here with gambling addiction, hitting the jackpot), seeing the proofs, noticing your article on PubMed, and, the ultimate kick, finally seeing it published. Editors could try to enhance these highs. Make the submission response more personal. Individualize rejection letters and be encouraging. Make the acceptance letter more celebratory. Enhance the proofs experience. Make it simple to access the pdf of the final publication. Arrange a tracking system to inform the author of current status and likely dates. Essentially, reduce the technical, enhance the emotional and massage the trigger points. After lecturing on PA, several dermatologists contacted me to admit their addiction, and an anonymous reviewer of this manuscript also self-diagnosed PA. This disorder may be prevalent in the academic community across all disciplines, especially among the most 'successful' academics. These academics may also be in the grip of the closely related 'research addiction' for which the ultimate high is the Eureka moment of scientific discovery. PA probably occurs among other authors such as novelists and journalists, whose career choice may spring from their PA. Understanding PA may allow authors to have more insight into their behaviour and enable editors to strengthen their journals.

      "abstract": "Intelligibility measures, which assess the number of words or phonemes a listener correctly transcribes or repeats, are commonly used metrics for speech perception research. While these measures have many benefits for researchers, they also come with a number of limitations. By pointing out the strengths and limitations of this approach, including how it fails to capture aspects of perception such as listening effort, this article argues that the role of intelligibility measures must be reconsidered in fields such as linguistics, communication disorders, and psychology. Recommendations for future work in this area are presented.",

      "title": "Failure-driven learning as model-based self-redesign",
      "abstract": "Learning is a competence fundamental to intelligence. Intelligent agents who solve problems in a realistic environment need to learn in order to improve their performance in terms of the quality of the solutions they produce, the efficiency of their problem-solving process, and the class of problems they can solve.\r\nFailures in problem solving signify the need and the opportunity to learn. One way in which an agent may effectively use its failed problem-solving experiences to learn, is by reflection upon its own problem-solving process. To that end, the agent needs an explicit model of its own problem-solving behavior. This work adopts a design stance towards reflective, failure-driven, learning. This stance gives rise to a specific computational model which is based on three key ideas: (i) agents can be viewed as abstract devices; (ii) their problem solving can be understood in terms of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models; finally, (iii) failure-driven learning can be viewed as a model-based redesign process, in which the agent uses its comprehension of its own problem solving to repair itself. When the agent fails, it uses feedback from the world, and the trace of the failed process, to search through this model and identify the cause(s) of its failure. Then, it proceeds to repair its problem solving, in order not to fail again for the same reason.\r\nThis theory of reflective learning has been implemented in a fully operational system, A scUTOGNOSTIC. A scUTOGNOSTIC is like a shell in that it provides the SBF language for specifying a problem solver, and the inference mechanism for monitoring this problem-solver's reasoning, assigning blame when it fails, and repairing it appropriately. Three different systems have been modeled in A scUTOGNOSTIC'S SBF language: R scOUTER, a path planning system, K scRITIK2, a design system, and an autonomous, reactive agent implemented in the AuRA architecture. Extensive experiments conducted with A scUTOGNOSTIC demonstrate the generality and the effectiveness of its learning process.",

      "title": "Workplace Functional Impairment Due to Mental Disorders",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPsychiatrists are commonly expected to conduct disability assessments.These include an assessment of the worker's functioning, putative impairment, risk, and capacity to work.Employers and other third parties, either administrative or judicial, subsequently make disability determinations based on such assessments.This assessment also forms the foundation for return-to-work determinations, or for determining the employer's duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship.To the extent the general psychiatrist becomes involved in assessing these occupational matters, the psychiatrist is practicing forensic psychiatry.The role and responsibilities of the treating psychiatrist, within in the context of a traditional physician-patient relationship, differ vastly from one conducting an occupational or forensic evaluation.Yet, the boundaries between these distinct and often irreconcilable roles are not always clearly delineated, properly understood, or abided by.The forensic aspects of psychiatric practice are often viewed as intrusive and challenging by non-forensically trained psychiatrists, representing a role conflict many psychiatrists find themselves poorly equipped to navigate.This chapter outlines the common psychiatric disorders encountered in clinical and occupational settings.It discusses the concepts of impairment and disability, as well as the benefits of working.The most commonly requested opinions in occupational psychiatric assessments are that of a psychiatric diagnosis, causation, impairment, fitness to work (FTW), and disability, along with recommendations for further investigations and treatment.The importance of objectively measuring impairment is outlined, along with reliably establishing a diagnosis (if any), along with the non-linear relationship between mental disorder, impairment and disability.For the purposes of this chapter, any reference to mental disorders are implied to include the broad range of disorders captured in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM IV-TR, which includes the substance-related disorders (i.e.Substance Abuse, Substance Dependence, or Addiction, and others).This chapter addresses the main pitfalls and risks associated with Independent Medical (i.e.Psychiatric and Addictions) Evaluations (IME), and provides a template for conducting these.The potential cost saving associated with implementing evidence-based interventions drives a sound business case for addressing mental disorders in the workplace.This chapter offers a pragmatic approach to treatment matching and disability management for workers with mental disorders (i.e.including substance-related disorders).It outlines the principles of vocational rehabilitation in the context of psychopathology, mental disorders, impairment and disability, ensuring safety, as well as optimal clinical and economic outcomes.www.intechopen.com",

Recent studies have identified a number of psychological factors that could explain the maintenance of the disorder. These factors are presented here as part of a comprehensive psychological maintenance model of SAD. This model assumes that social apprehension is associated with unrealistic social standards and a deficiency in selecting attainable social goals. When confronted with challenging social situations, individuals with SAD shift their attention toward their anxiety, view themselves negatively as a social object, overestimate the negative consequences of a social encounter, believe that they have little control over their emotional response, and view their social skills as inadequate to effectively cope with the social situation. In order to avoid social mishaps, individuals with SAD revert to maladaptive coping strategies, including avoidance and safety behaviors, followed by post-event rumination, which leads to further social apprehension in the future. Possible disorder-specific intervention strategies are discussed.",

We conceptualise learned helplessness in operant terms as the behavioural effects of a lack of reinforcement and in goal-directed terms as the dysregulation of goal-directed behaviour. Our central claim is that if one fails to reach a goal (e.g. the goal to secure a job), then not only this goal but also other related goals (e.g. the goal to maintain social relationships) may lose their motivating effects. The similarity relation between goal stimuli can therefore shed light on how failure in one life domain can come to affect various other life domains. We detail the relation between our proposal and existing theories and discuss new research and clinical directions.",

At the same time, there is a lack of a uniform definition, conception and assessment of suicidal ambivalence. On this background, the current scoping review aims to explore the extent, range, and nature of research activity on suicidal ambivalence and to summarize research findings. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in four different databases (PubMed, Psychinfo, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) using an array of search terms (e.g., ambivalence, internal suicide debate, reasons for living and reasons for dying, wish to live and wish to die). Results In total, 28 articles published between 1977 and 2023 were included in the scoping review. The study situation lacks a clear definition, conceptualization and operationalization of suicidal ambivalence. Nonetheless, suicidal ambivalence is a common experience in persons contemplating suicide and suicidal ambivalence seems to be present before, during and after a suicide attempt. Suicidal ambivalence is associated with diverse markers of negative/positive mental health as well as suicidal ideation and behavior. Conclusion Results point to the relevance of suicidal ambivalence. At the same time, there are large gaps in knowledge about the development, impact and therapeutic responsiveness of suicidal ambivalence.",

The individual is the variable to be manipulated. The social norms and artifacts outside of the clinic or hospital are regarded more or less as constants.

      "title": "Assessment of learning through non-invasive neurophysiological measures",
      "abstract": "Publiekssamenvatting Om te meten of iemand voldoende geleerd heeft, en dus ‘geslaagd’ is, wordt er doorgaans gebruik gemaakt van een enkel bepalend testmoment na afloop van alle inspanning om te leren. Het proces dat plaatsvindt tijdens leren blijft op deze manier onderbelicht. Inzicht in het leerproces kan echter waardevol zijn, omdat dit de mogelijkheid biedt om leren goed te monitoren en om ondersteuning te bieden waar nodig. Het leerproces zou mogelijk continu gemeten kunnen worden met neurofysiologische maten. Neurofysiologische maten geven inzicht in lichamelijke processen. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn maten van hersenactiviteit, hartslag, ademhaling, zweetresponse en oog-gerelateerde maten zoals pupilgrootte, knipperen, fixaties en oogbewegingen. Tijdens leren neemt de mentale inspanning die geleverd moet worden af, deze maten reageren hierop en kunnen daardoor inzicht geven in leren. In de wetenschappelijke literatuur bestaat er tot nu toe een onopgeloste discussie over de validiteit van neurofysiologie in het meten van leren. Waar aan de ene kant een groep wetenschappers optimistisch is, staat daar een groep wetenschappers tegenover die hun bedenkingen heeft. In dit proefschrift is deze discussie geadresseerd in een (meta-)analyse van 113 eerder uitgevoerde experimenten, 5 nieuwe experimenten en een SWOT (sterktes, zwaktes, kansen en bedreigingen) analyse. Hierbij staan de volgende vragen centraal: 1) Welke neurofysiologische maten geven inzicht in leren? 2) Welke factoren beinvloeden neurofysiologische veranderingen tijdens leren? 3) Hoe kan neurofysiologie worden toegepast om leren te meten in de praktijk? De resultaten gepresenteerd in dit proefschrift laten zien dat neurofysiologie geschikt is om leren te meten. Verschillende neurofysiologische maten veranderen consistent tijdens leren in de experimentele studies, wat suggereert dat deze specifieke maten robuust zijn in het meten van leren. Uit de resultaten blijkt ook dat individuele verschillen (zoals leeftijd) en taak-gerelateerde factoren (zoals het wel of niet geven van feedback) effect hebben op neurofysiologische veranderingen tijdens leren. Het is daarom van belang om met deze factoren rekening te houden. Bij het meten van leren in de praktijk middels neurofysiologie moet daarnaast rekening worden gehouden met een aantal zwaktes en bedreigingen. Een paar voorbeelden zijn technische uitdagingen, kosten voor hard- en software en data privacy. Als dit goed wordt gedaan kan er optimaal geprofiteerd worden van voordelen en kansen. Zo geeft neurofysiologie rijke objectieve data die de mogelijkheid biedt om de leertaak in real-time aan te passen aan het individu. Bovendien worden neurofysiologische sensoren in toenemende mate in draadloze en makkelijk handelbare apparatuur verwerkt (denk bijvoorbeeld aan smartwatches met een hartslagsensor) waardoor metingen goedkoper, minder tijdrovend en comfortabeler worden. Er zijn nog een aantal stappen te zetten voordat neurofysiologie grootschalig kan worden ingezet op een valide manier. Wel is het duidelijk dat neurofysiologie potentie heeft in het meten van leren. Een toekomstbeeld waarin een enkel testmoment na het leren wordt vervangen of aangevuld door het continu monitoren en bijstellen aan de hand van neurofysiologie kan dus goed werkelijkheid worden.",

      "title": "Measures of Personal Success and Failure: A Self-Assessment, Applying the Sociological Imagination",
      "abstract": "I sometimes look back and ask myself a series of questions: am I doing? Am I having a successful life so far or have I had more failure than success? How do I measure my personal success and failure? Was my success or failure based upon my own standards or other people's determinations? How do I decide my standards? Are they influenced by other people's What is considered to be a success and what is considered to be a failure? Was my success really successful or were they considered successful only according to other people's considerations? Did I really fail in my failure or was I just locking myself behind another set of bars created by other people? Am I the only one who has been living in such a life pursuing this kind of success and avoiding that kind of failure or am I just one of many whose eyes are blindfolded by the society's perception? As I am trying to search for the answers, I find one question leading into another one. The deeper I get into these questions, the more I find that some common senses aren't so common anymore, because I cannot tell whether my common senses represent the principles of how things are and why things are; maybe my common senses are just Islands of Meaning (Zerubavel 18-23) in Eviatar Zerubavel's words, I have sorted my personal experiences into distinct categories (Zerubavel 18-23). Or maybe I was into a world already interpreted and organized by others (Zerubavel 18-23). Perhaps I should use the Sociological imagination (Mills 1) described by C. Wright Mills, to do a self-research by linking my personal experiences with society and history. I was born in a small town in China, grew up in an ordinary family, somehow managed to cross the ocean and come to the United States. Thirty one years old today, I have a respectable job with decent salary; thirty one years old, I have just had my American Dream come true, owning my first house. To a lot of people, they think I am having quite a successful life so far; but then I look even closely at myself: thirty one years old, I am still working on my first undergraduate degree; thirty one years old, I haven't done anything that is really meaningful other than just working and working to make money; thirty one years old, I still don't have a clear picture of what I will be in the next thirty years. To some people, to me at least, it is a failure. Ever since China opened itself up to the world, although the thousand years long of traditions still root in most Chinese, western cultures have always been the exceptional ones in the perspectives of many Chinese. As China is blooming in economic and many other areas, western cultures have become even more dominant, American culture is the most prevailing one among them. Walking down the streets in China today, you find you are surrounded by American cultural symbols--Nike, Adidas, one store after another; McDonald, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, from corner to corner. You can see people are lining up in every one of them. They all believe what they get are much better products, because they all believe USA is better than China when it comes to anything other than the national pride. I was, or maybe I am still, one of them. I came to the United States because I believed I would make a better living. Stories heard from parents or seen from TV about people who migrated to America are always wonderful; those people always come back with money and prestige and they all seem very successful. People envy them. I envied them. That was the reason I did not hesitate to make the decision to come here when I got the opportunity to participate in a student exchange program between US and China. My parents were very supportive too even though the application fee and other expenses were quite costly. My parents didn't have enough money to support me but they managed to borrow money from friends and family knowing that they would have to work twice harder and I would have to work just as hard as they did in the next few years; however we all believed it would be worth it at the end. …",

Let one notice that this definition means that intelligence or intelligent behavior is not an absolute concept in at least three ways: • Intelligence is relative to the goal or problem being solved. • Intelligence is relative to the situation where the goal arises. • Intelligence is relative to the knowledge and experience of the solver. Usually, intelligence is conceived as a property of individuals. In recent years, the recognizance has grown that this conception is too narrow. It makes sense and it is most useful to consider the intelligence of groups of individuals, whether small or very large. Such intelligence is still the intelligence of one entity— the group—but it is made of the ways individual intelligences are orchestrated or coordinate themselves. This being given, collective intelligence (CI) is defined here simply as the intelligence of entities constituted by several or many individuals. As taken, CI is about the intelligent behavior of entities which are conceived from the beginning as not being atomic.",

      "abstract": "Motivation, self-regulation, and stress are conceptually intertwined. For example, self-regulation is the modulation of behavior through a variety of cognitive processes representing self-observation (e.g., self-monitoring), judgment processes (e.g., comparing against standards), and self-reaction (e.g., rewards and punishment). These processes can be impaired by physiological stress, fatigue, or distracting thought/feelings. Furthermore, setting high goals, goal-striving, and goal abandonment are likely to influence, and be influenced by, stress. Other theories like the job characteristics model and self-determination theory provide implication for how to change the environment to support motivation and decrease stress (e.g., fulfill the needs of autonomy, belonging, and competence). Finally, action-state orientation can describe when people flexibly disengage from irrelevant concerns (preoccupation), effectively initiate required actions (hesitation), and stay focused until tasks are completed (volatility).",

Pedagogical engagements that disconnect individuals from acts of humanity and grace and the development of self-fueled ideological aims ensure competition, domination, and superiority. This suggests an interrogation of those engagements that have been, as Arendt (1998) suggests, “uncritically and slavishly accepted” (p. 179). The chapter examines concepts and constructs that are taken for granted—furthering individual pride, creating and posting class rules, and building upon “what is known”—revealing that social justice or socially just actions are neither the reproduction of an existing discourse nor preparation for future goal-oriented behaviors.",

It is a social institution and a social process that students can easily relate to as a significant part of their lived experience. There are also many social problems within our education system that students may have directly or indirectly experienced. Therefore, using examples from education to demonstrate concepts allow students to relate their educational experiences to the larger social world. Since students possess diverse educational experiences and view the culture of education differently, their perspectives can be explained through theories. When students learn to apply theories, they gain a better appreciation of constructing a understanding of their world. \n\nObjective\nStudents need to possess the ability to constructively and critically examine, analyze, and evaluate their lived experiences and their social world. This means to define and explain their positions and views on a topic or issue from a frame of reference. This also means to define and explain different and contradicting positions and views on a topic or issue from a frame of reference. In other words, students need to learn to use their sociological imagination in understanding societal problems. \n\nRequirement\nThe objective can only be achieved if students possess a basic working knowledge of functional and conflict theories (in this particular case). It may be necessary to review the basic tenets of the theories again.",

      "abstract": "The increased adoption of artificial intelligence in professional work environments has also led to a need for distinctly human competencies. This chapter examines human capabilities that AI cannot replicate and will remain indispensable. Critical thinking emerges as a significant differentiator in light of AI’s limitations. While AI demonstrates proficiency in data analysis and automation, it lacks the capacity to see across assumptions, evaluate information objectively, and construct robust arguments independently. Individuals must develop the ability to assess AI outputs critically and apply analytical reasoning to complex situations. Human creativity surpasses contemporary AI’s current capabilities. Although AI generates content and solves problems creatively, it encounters difficulties with genuine innovation and human emotional connection. Personal experiences, imagination, and emotional intelligence come together to produce work that resonates profoundly with others. Humans excel in emotional and interpersonal competencies. AI cannot match human abilities in emotional comprehension, relationship building, and social behaviour. Effective workplace relationships depend on empathy, active listening, and receptive communication—skills preferred when collaborating with both human colleagues and AI. Future success depends to a large extent on the development of these distinct human abilities. Young professionals who recognize and improve these skills will thrive in future work environments. This chapter helps in understanding AI-integrated future workplaces where human-AI collaboration determines professional achievement.",

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how individual and group self-beliefs are formed prior to and during a group task and how they change as a function of time after the tasks. The empirical study reported on here looks for changes in self- and collective efficacy that might occur at two different times, to identify their different effects; these are immediately after a task is completed, and again ten days later. The conclusion is that memory deficiencies result in the maintenance of self- and collective efficacies that do not appropriately match the skills of group members and that this gap affects their ongoing performance.",

The development of suicidal behaviour is mediated or facilitated by certain thoughts or patterns of thoughts. These may reflect differences in the general normal cognitive style of dealing with social problems or difficult emotions, or they may be due to the presence of abnormal cognitive distortions.

      "title": "Neuroscience and literacy: an integrative view",
      "abstract": "Significant challenges exist globally regarding literacy teaching and learning. To address these challenges, key features of how the brain works should be taken into account. First, perception is an active process based in detection of errors in hierarchical predictions of sensory data and action outcomes. Reading is a particular case of this non-linear predictive process. Second, emotions play a key role in underlying cognitive functioning, including oral and written language. Negative emotions undermine motivation to learn. Third, there is not the fundamental difference between listening/speaking and reading/writing often alleged on the basis of evolutionary arguments. Both are socio-cultural practices that are driven through the communication imperative of the social brain. Fourth, both listening and reading are contextually occurring pyscho-social practices of understanding, shaped by current knowledge and cultural contexts and practices. Fifth, the natural operation of the brain is not rule-based, as is supposed in the standard view of linguistics: it is prediction, based on statistical pattern recognition. This all calls into question narrow interpretations of the widely quoted \"Simple View of Reading\", which argues that explicit decoding is the necessary route to comprehension. One of the two neural routes to reading does not involve such explicit decoding processes, and can be activated from the earliest years. An integrated view of brain function reflecting the non-linear contextual nature of the reading process implies that an ongoing focus on personal meaning and understanding from the very beginning provides positive conditions for learning all aspects of reading and writing.",

      "title": "Social Cognitive Theory and Personal Agency",
      "abstract": "Social cognitive theory contends that all human functioning – including that of students and teachers – is determined by the interacting influence of personal, behavioural, and environmental factors (Bandura 1986). Personal factors include beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and physical attributes. Behaviours include the choices people make, how they perform, and how they manage their lives. Environmental factors include one's physical and social surroundings, peer groups, and family. Human activity is not solely determined by the environment nor by inner impulses. Rather, through a process of triadic reciprocal determinism, personal, behavioural, and environmental forces dynamically interact. A social cognitive view considers humans to be agents in their own lives. Students and teachers influence their own circumstances and behaviour by their own efforts, thereby exercising personal agency. When people lack the personal means to achieve their aims, they can solicit the help of others who can act on their behalf (i.e., proxy agency). Successful functioning also requires working with others to achieve shared goals through collective agency. All three forms of agency enable individuals to exercise some control over their educational pursuits and outcomes. People exercise personal agency through their capacity for forethought, self-reaction, and self-reflection. Prior to acting, people can make plans, set goals, envision desired outcomes, and motivate themselves. As they carry out tasks, they monitor their performance and make necessary adjustments. After performing, they look back on their successes and failures and evaluating what happened and why. These self-driven processes are foundational elements of self-regulated learning. Self-efficacy, individuals' judgments of their capabilities to perform given tasks, is theorized to be the most central of these self-referent processes to learning and motivation (Bandura 1997). A large body of evidence has shown that learners who believe that they are capable of succeeding at the tasks they face will be more likely to act in ways that bring about their own success. Low self-efficacy undermines performance and motivation. Self-efficacy derives from people's interpretations of information from four primary sources: their own performance, their observations of others' behaviours, the evaluative messages they receive, and their own physiological and affective states (Bandura 1997). Self-efficacy and its sources may differ as a function of individual (e.g., gender, ethnicity) and situational (e.g., cultural background, learning environment) factors. Researchers have called for greater attention to these contextual factors and to the methodological approaches that would be most useful for investigating them.",

      "title": "Can <i>Think Aloud</i> Be Used to Teach and Assess Clinical Reasoning in Graduate Medical Education?",
      "abstract": "Clinical reasoning may be defined as the cognitive processes involved in arriving at a diagnosis or treatment plan.1 It is central to effective medical practice, yet it remains elusive and continues to present a challenge to clinical teachers and learners.2 The antemortem misdiagnosis rate at autopsies and audits of adverse events in hospitals attest to the continuing importance of clinical reasoning, despite the introduction of guidelines and advances in technology.3,4 The level of quality and accuracy of the clinical reasoning that underlies diagnostic and management decisions is the difference between trainees and expert clinicians. The process of learning clinical reasoning may be assisted by using think aloud.Think aloud is a research method used to study cognition and is considered the optimal method to capture thought processes.5 Cognitive psychologists view thinking as a temporal sequence of mental states. Each state contains information retrieved from long-term memory, perceptions from the environment, and the inferences generated from the recovered information. Think aloud occurs when individuals verbalize their thoughts while performing a task. It is our view that during think aloud individuals do not describe or explain what they are thinking; they simply verbalize how they are using the available information to generate a solution to a problem.5 For example, when asked to multiply 17 by 13, an individual might say, \"17 × 10 is 170 and 17 × 3 is 51: adding these gives the answer 221.\" When people verbalize how they are thinking as they perform a task, the sequence of thoughts is not changed by the added instruction to \"think aloud.\"5Expert clinicians gather and use clinical information to generate accurate diagnoses. However, this is usually done in an implicit and frequently automatic process. Think aloud is a method of making clinical reasoning processes more explicit, so that inexperienced clinicians are able to learn from these processes. Think aloud methods provide explanations and descriptions of complex information, and parallels the clinical reasoning process. Think aloud explicitly allows trainees to see how high-content knowledge is used by expert clinicians, who are able to select the important information and generate links and associations to organize this information. Research has shown how trainees and expert clinicians are able to identify important pieces of information for a diagnosis.6 However, only expert clinicians are also able to identify and organize the important information to generate a correct diagnosis. Think aloud allows trainees to hear how expert clinicians selectively organize information to solve a patient problem, and it also allows supervising clinicians to understand the way trainees are thinking when using think aloud to explain their developing reasoning process. It transforms the thought processes of expert clinicians, which are otherwise automatic and implicit, into explicit and concrete explanations. Instead of learning how to deal with complex cases merely by exposure to many cases, think aloud provides a systematic way for trainees to develop their clinical reasoning skills for complex cases.7Evidence to support think aloud as a way to capture thought processes comes from task analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.5,8 In task analysis, an individual's thought processes and his or her steps used to solve a problem are made explicit.5 The contention that verbalization accurately reflects the thought processes is supported by the fact that verbalized thoughts are consistent with the sequence of intermediate steps used to solve a problem, and other sequences of verbalized thoughts are used to generate correct answers. Laboratory analyses of recordings of reaction times, error rates, patterns of brain recordings, and sequences of eye fixations add further support to the contention that verbalization during think aloud reflects thought processes.5 Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows how brain activity differs when physicians answer a question, and when they think aloud about how they arrive at their chosen answer.8 These findings add further evidence that think aloud is a measure of the process of critical cognition. In think aloud, it is the thinking processes involved that are important. How we arrive at an answer is what is instructive, rather than just focusing on the answer itself.5Much of expert clinicians' reasoning is based on pattern recognition, which is implicit.9 Pattern recognition occurs very quickly and without deliberation. We suggest that teachers retrospectively consider why they arrived at a particular diagnosis based on pattern recognition. Was this based on experience with a similar case previously, or was it that the constellation of symptoms and signs were characteristic or pathognomonic of a particular condition? Most experienced clinicians who are aware of the danger of premature closure when using pattern recognition would seek immediate confirmatory evidence from further history and physical examination to support their intuition or diagnosis based on pattern recognition. The reason for the pattern recognition, and how to avoid the associated risk of premature closure, can be demonstrated to trainees. Think aloud reveals steps in the reasoning process and makes explicit how decisions are made—outlining the process of making the diagnosis, rather than just focusing on the diagnosis. All thinking processes involved in clinical reasoning shown in box 1 can be captured during think aloud. Think aloud shows that clinical reasoning is an iterative process in which the repetition of collecting and analyzing data continues until a final diagnosis is made.10How can think aloud be used in graduate medical education to learn and assess clinical reasoning? We suggest that trainees be encouraged to pause intermittently as they present their clinical findings to their peers or supervisors, and use think aloud to explain what and how they are thinking. This can be done in small group teaching sessions or when they are presenting their findings to a supervisor (best done without the patient being present). When trainees do this, their clinical reasoning can be assessed and common errors can be remedied.11 If their supervisors explain how they themselves are thinking as part of this session, trainees can learn how an expert thinks. The table shows an outline of how think aloud can be used.While there are a number of ways to teach and learn clinical reasoning, think aloud has unique advantages.12 Based on our experience of including anecdotal feedback from clinical teachers following training in the think aloud technique, advantages of this approach are shown in box 2.We have conducted workshops at 2 international conferences where clinicians were instructed in how to use think aloud.13,14 The feedback was very positive. Attendees agreed that think aloud is a useful technique to teach and assess clinical reasoning in clinical practice, and it provides an actual teaching strategy for what is a complex process.To better understand the value of the think aloud technique for teaching and learning clinical reasoning, well-designed research such as comparing the effect of using teach aloud to other methods of teaching clinical reasoning, qualitative research to establish themes on what aspects of think aloud are effective, and a longitudinal study to assess the long-term effects of introducing teach aloud on clinical practice will be key next steps.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a model delineating attributes which enable a literate reader to successfully participate in a pluralistic society. The paper outlines the model as building upon and defining the traditional skills and schema views of reading comprehension which include maturity, attitudes, dispositions, intellectual abilities, knowledge, and experience. In this model, however, maturity emerges as the dominant attribute. The paper examines the attributes of the evaluative reader, rather than the complete model of reaeing comprehension already developed, and discusses the assumptions and propositions that inform the model. These include the iollowing: (1) the reader is in a continual state of intellectual, experiential and attitudinal change; (2) a reciprocal relationship exists among a reader's attitudes, experience, and intellectual abilities; (3) age is a variable that only partly determines maturity; (4) experience and knowledge can contribute to comprehension when intellectual abilities are limited; (5) experience and knowledge have a stronger effect on attitudes and dispositions than does intellectual abilities; (6) diminishment of any of these attributes limits a reader's ability to understand a text; (7) some texts place more of a burden on one attribute rather than another; (8) some attributes can be enhanced through instruction; (9) the evaluative reader must have multiple literacies that are more than just basic skills. The paper also describes criteria necessary for a valid assessment of the model. A figure is included.

Theories and research supporting the effectiveness of SEL programs in developing those competencies and related outcomes are discussed. It is argued that to one extent or another each of the five competencies underlie self-discipline—students regulating their own behavior, exhibiting prosocial behavior, and inhibiting antisocial behavior while requiring minimal external governance. Unfortunately, many students are socially and emotionally competent yet fail to act morally. This is often explained by mechanisms of moral disengagement, as discussed in this chapter. The chapter ends with recommendations for developing social and emotional competencies and especially those that underlie self-discipline.",

      "title": "Learning moral judgement in higher education",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT The contemporary world is faced with many global problems, such as atmospheric pollution. The handling of these problems involves not only the assembling of established knowledge and technologies but diagnosing, and making due allowance for, powerful subjective influences. These latter involve subjective perceptions of the world around one and—especially—assumptions about values and about priorities among values, ‘values˚s being used in the sense of the driving motives of people's lives to which an element of obligation is attached. There would appear to be an urgent need, therefore, for education systems to include programmes which prepare students for recognising, and learning to think critically about, such subjective perceptions and value questions. To develop such insight, in a form which influences one's active professional judgement, the usual lecture courses are inadequate: the learning must have an experiential and indeed ‘existential˚s basis; it must be ‘felt in the bones˚s. The existential dimension required in the exploration and analysis of value issues will only be secured if students become personally involved in the study of the motivation and morality of human situations, whether in the humanities or elsewhere. Some account is given of various techniques for achieving these ends. A final section discusses the problem of indoctrination as it may arise in this context.",

The view of measurement seems congruent with diverse conceptual positions. The chapter considers several problems in personality measurement. It shows that a personality variable is a disposition to respond in a given way to particular stimuli in a designated setting. The evaluation of a test or of any other measurement operation is based ultimately on just one criterion: the degree of correspondence between the measurement operation and the concept which the technique is designed to measure. Inadequacy of definitions stressed the breadth of typical conceptions of traits, together with a failure to specify stimuli and conditions. With a few exceptions, personality variables tend to be of two kinds: intuitive or informal generalizations and systematic constructs.",

It involves reasoning about social relationships in which a person is embedded when acting in a specific kind of context—whether academic or real-world—that requires construction, evaluation, and application of knowledge. Informed reflexivity is the learned disposition to reason about one's knowledge-related actions, entailing context-specific epistemic characteristics. It involves an intentional stance about the need to reason about oneself and the context. Discussions of two disciplinary competencies (science and history) and two cross-disciplinary competencies (critical thinking and writing) illustrate how epistemically competent practices instantiate informed reflexivity. Promoting informed reflexivity as an epistemic virtue might dispose students toward reliable processes of knowing and making epistemically informed resolved action appropriate to the context.",

      "abstract": "Gamification approaches in the workplace are encountering strong and passionate critics as well as dedicated proponents as the very notions of games, play, and work are being reconsidered and reframed. Workplaces are incorporating increasing varieties of concurrent and emerging games; some of these games are directly linked to how employees are projected to produce value for an organization and are paid and promoted, while others can be recreational, educational, or even medical (involving health diagnosis or treatment). In effect, many workplace settings have become the platforms for multiple, sometimes interlocking sets of rules, enforcement mechanisms, and related gaming structures. “Multigamification” approaches explicitly recognize game-related complexities and interactions, and provide means for mitigating cognitive overload, character conflicts, and other concerns. Participants can be immersed in technology-enhanced games that infuse social, medical, and economic themes either as a part of strategic initiatives in gamification (and multigamification, as described in this paper) or through emergent and less-tightly structured efforts. The overall wellbeings of organizational participants may relate in some way in how they engage in specific games as well as to how they deal with multiple games either in sequence or simultaneously; one or more games can be designated as “work” and others as “play,” sometimes reflecting traditional narratives that contrast labor deemed as “productive” with recreation. Developers can become active in exploring and tailoring games for specific workplace contexts, addressing issues of intergame compatibility, theme interaction, and synergy as well as participant overload. Multigamification can involve forms of competition among the games themselves as they compete for the limited attention of participants. This paper also addresses the challenging policy and design issues related to workplace games’ effects on participant wellbeing. Emergence of nested and overlapping gaming spheres can increase the complexity of organizational life as well as expand its ludic dimensions.",

The appropriate unit of analysis is activity. Working is a subcategory of this larger unit. Six areas of activity are distinguished: education and training in early life, paid tasks or work, updating education throughout life, unpaid tasks or voluntary activity, education of the third age, and active or passive leisure. Historical, sociological, and anthropological evidence is reviewed and related to the psychological analysis of the meaning of working. It emerges that work is a controversial topic; it is extensively praised by some and condemned by others. Few would deny that paid work is a necessary way of obtaining basic and supplementary human requirements under present-day circumstances, but the differential conditions and constraints under which it is carried out are not always accepted as a necessary corollary. Is paid work a necessary or a desirable means of obtaining a standard of living? The answer depends on whether paid work is seen in isolation or as a subsystem of a wider range of activities which together result in a fulfilling life.",

The approach is known as \"individual style of activity\" and is fundamental to the analysis of practical achievement in Russian psychology. Sev- eral areas of applied research are presented to illustrate the approach. These studies examine the process of adaptation to objective requirements by participants with distinct individual features. This research does not emphasize the classification of individuals into particular groups for the purpose of selection; rather it emphasizes how to facilitate the adaptation of people with diverse personal features through the development of individualized methods of performance, teaching, and training. The findings have many important applications in education, sports, work, and other performance settings.",

      "abstract": "D .L^ecause our schools have played a key role in forming the American character and will continue to do so, it is essential to understand the psychological principles underlying educational programs, and to develop ones that might guide future innovation towards forming productive character traits. With the goal of preparing students to succeed in a rapidly changing meritocracy, innovations in education often contribute to turning out compulsive winners and increasingly jaded consumers who have become cynical about learning. These young people may be expert at test taking but contribute little to the society and are often miserable because they feel centerless. Parents and teachers justify these innovations in terms of test results, but unless they are evaluated in terms of character, their long range effects are likely to be negative. An example is the use of competitive games to speed up learning. Competitive behavior can be rooted in different character systems, ranging from a healthy pride in performance or workmanship to a predatory urge to destroy one's competition or a desperate need to be a winner in order to escape a feeling of worthlessness. Tests of ability, endurance and courage may help develop both the individual's potentialities and realism, and in athletics, speed, strength and skill provide opportunities for natural competition. However, it s another matter when all of learning is fitted into a game. Teaching through such games may inject rich doses of excitement and learning drive into many students who will as a result increase their test scores. But there is the",

      "title": "Enriching a Survey Course in Educational Psychology through a Team Teaching Format",
      "abstract": "Educational psychology is a far ranging discipline that focuses on the student, the teacher, the classroom and the teaching/learning process. The challenge of an introductory course in educational psychology is to familiarize the student with both theory and application in such diverse areas as human growth and development, learning, personality development, motivation, measurement and classroom management. This creates a problem for faculty members who seemingly must have expertise in all of these areas. While most, if not all, educational psychology faculty certainly have some familiarity with all these topics, in most cases, their expertise will be limited to a few of the topics closely related to their specialization or area of research. This often results in a course that focuses on the faculty member's research and superficially touches on other essential topics. Obviously this can result in significant gaps in student learning. A team teaching approach has been found to be very useful in resolving this problem. Team teaching is a method that has been successfully utilized in a wide range of subject areas, including optometry, women's studies, anthropology, economics and psychology (Heath, Carlson & Kurtz, 1987; Toomey & Eldridge, 1982; Plotnicov, 1985; Lindaver, 1990; Flanagan & Ralston, 1983). This article describes the team teaching approach used at The University of Montevallo in an introductory educational psychology course. The course, while open to all students, is taken primarily by junior teacher education majors. Logistics Each of four full time faculty members in the Department of Counseling and Educational Psychology is assigned one section of this course as part of his/her regular teaching load. Two of the sections are scheduled at 9:00 A.M. Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and two are scheduled at 11:00 A.M. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Each sections has a maximum enrollment of 30 students. The sections which meet at the same hour are then combined, thus producing two classes of 50-60 students, one at 9:00 A.M. and the other at 11:00 A.M. Prior to the beginning of each semester, the Educational Psychology team meets to plan a schedule for the semester. After a review and updating of the curriculum each team member selects topics most appropriate for his/her areas of expertise. In addition, the calendar is planned such that no faculty member is scheduled to teach on a day when he/she might have other conflicting professional responsibilities. Some days involve just one faculty member who would on that day teach at both the 9:00 A.M. and 11:00 A.M. hours thus meeting all four sections on that day. Other class days may involve two faculty members while others may require the presence of the entire team. As part of the syllabus, each student receives a schedule showing the topic to be covered each day, the appropriate reading assignment for that topic and which faculty member(s) will be in class that day. Tests are constructed by creating a table of specifications from the topics discussed during the period covered by the tests. Each faculty member is responsible for writing test questions for his/her sessions. The grade in the course is based on the scores on four exams, each covering one-fourth of the course, plus an application level comprehensive final exam. The exam covering the final one-fourth of the course and the comprehensive final are given together on the final exam date. Each exam consists of fifty multiple-choice questions, thus the total possible points is 250. Letter grades are assigned based on a norm-referenced cluster system. Students are also given the opportunity to earn extra credit points through participation in several optional projects. Each faculty member is responsible for the grades of students in her/his section. Advantages The chief advantage of the team teaching approach is the resolution of the problem mentioned at the beginning of this article. …",

      "abstract": "Critical thinking ability is important to be possessed by every individual, especially in the era of globalization. The ability to think critically supports the individual to overcome the problems in life, among which environmental problems are. Individuals and environments cannot be separated, the relationship between them is reciprocal. Solutions to environmental problems can be realized through critical thinking. Each individual's critical thinking ability varies, depending on the frequency of frequent exercises to develop that ability. Such exercises include frequently asking questions, posing assumptions, identifying information, making inferences, identifying impacts, and so on. It is therefore important to identify the critical thinking skills of individuals in a forum. Description of the ability to think critically about environmental problems is expected to be the basis for the design of development of learning plan set related to the subject of Environmental Knowledge. The description of students' critical thinking ability is obtained through questions prepared according to Polya’s problem solving syntax. The set of questions contains elements of reasoning that are judged based on the intellectual standards of reasoning by Paul and Elder.",

Play becomes pathological when it deviates from healthy play in one or more of three characteristic qualities: the relationship between playing and reality; the player’s experience of the play; and the relationship of the player to the objects of play (including self and other people, as well as inanimate objects). Healthy play accommodates to the real needs of self and others; pathological play avoids reality, through a narrow-minded preoccupation that allows individual needs to be subjugated to the creation of a pretence or narrative.",

      "abstract": "Competence with emergent intuitive awareness, from fringe-of-consciousness hunches to compelling difference-in-kind realisations, is an imprecise qualitative skill and, on this basis, one generally overlooked in clinical psychology training and supervision. This situation is at marked odds with an expanding literature highlighting that intuitions emerging from unconscious inferential cognition serve as a primary resource in the decision-making of expert practitioners across a dissimilar range of professions. Additionally, (i) over forty years extensive and distinct research into working memory conclusively demonstrates that System 1 autonomous inferential reasoning is the mind’s powerhouse, yet moreover (ii) plays a determining role in attention allocation and thereby meta-level reasoning processes (i.e., System 2; cognitive control/metacognition), the very constituents of reflective practice. In short, the case appears overwhelming for clinical intuition competency training. Additionally, a substantial reflective practice training literature which could readily be modified to include clinical intuition considerations sits immediately at hand. One difficulty, however, is that an accommodating model which will seamlessly link, firstly, difference-in-kind S1 emergent awareness, and, secondly, meta-level reflective practice, is yet to be highlighted. Remarkably, coherence-based reasoning sits in plain sight as a potential bridging position. Finally, expanding upon elementary suggestions in the literature, the toolbox skills ‘slow-onset speech’, ‘affective inquiry’, and ‘therapeutic presence’ are put forward as therapy technique functional for enhancing a clinician’s intuition sensitivity.",

The present contribution deals with various office furniture programmes adapted specifically to the needs of certain types of handicap, such as those of wheelchair users, visually impaired or blind persons, hand amputees, or cerebral palsied persons. Examples are described of disability-adapted office designs both for training purposes and workplaces, including CAD or a specifically designed arrangement for technical drawing with the feet. The main objective is to show that individual functional losses can already be compensated for to a large extent by proper selection of commercially available furniture and workplace design.",

Simopoulos and Cohen argue that knowledge of one's unconscious processes improves the forensic psychiatrist's capacity to manage complex forensic situations and to generate forensic formulations and opinions that are demonstrably more valid and reliable, much like competence in cultural assessment and formulation. In practice, the challenges posed by the application of these principles in forensic settings are far outweighed by the potential benefit. Forensic practice is informed by many specialties. Forensic psychiatrists do not have to complete full training in these disciplines to make use of the knowledge and perspectives they offer. The same may not be true of psychodynamic assessment and formulation. Although much can be learned from supervision, case seminars, conferences, and reading, such knowledge does little to foster awareness of one's unconscious processes that by definition operate outside awareness and thus contribute to the vitiating effect of bias. To date, the only method whereby psychiatrists can effectively come to appreciate their own unconscious processes in action is arguably through their own analysis conducted in the course of training in analysis or psychodynamic psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Collective Intentionality",
      "abstract": "Collective intentionality concerns the intentionality of groups or collectives. Intentionality is the property of being about, directed at, oriented toward, or representing objects, events, properties, and states of affairs. Examples of intentional states (states with intentionality, not just intentions) are belief, desire, hope, intention, admiration, perception, guilt, love, grief, fear, and so on. Collective intentionality involves joint, shared, or group intentionality and the intentionality of members (qua members) of groups that have joint or shared attitudes. More broadly, the study of collective intentionality concerns forms of intentionality that underpin social reality. What is distinctive about the study of collective intentionality within the broader study of social interactions and structures is its focus on the conceptual, ontological, and psychological features of joint or shared actions and attitudes, that is, actions and attitudes of (or apparent attributions of such to) groups or collectives, their relations to individual actions and attitudes, and their implications for the nature of social groups and their functioning. It subsumes collective action, intention, thought, reasoning, emotion, phenomenology, decision-making, responsibility, knowledge, trust, rationality, cooperation, competition, and related issues, and how these underpin social practices, conventions, institutions, and social ontology. The two main theoretical questions in the study of collective intentionality concern the ontology and psychology of collective agency and collective attitudes. The main ontological question is whether we should admit into our ontology group subjects of intentional states or attribute intentionality only to their members. The main psychological questions are, if we admit group subjects of intentional states, first, how to understand what they come to, whether they are the same or different than the intentional states we attribute to individuals and if different exactly how, and, second, what is special about the attitudes of individuals who participate in group action or whose attitudes underpin attributions of intentionality to groups? More specifically, can we understand what is special about the attitudes of individuals who participate in group agency or sustain the potential for group agency in terms of concepts already available in our understanding of individual agency, or must we introduce new concepts either of the modes of intending, believing, etc., or in the contents of such attitudes? Both questions concern the debate between methodological individualists and holists about the social, the first with respect to its ontology, the second with respect to its ideology.",

      "title": "Improving goal striving and resilience in older adults through a personalized metacognitive self-help intervention: a protocol paper",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Successful aging is often linked to individual’s ability to demonstrate resilience: the maintenance or quick recovery of functional ability, well-being, and quality of life despite losses or adversity. A crucial element of resilience is behavioral adaptability, which refers to the adaptive changes in behavior in accordance with internal or external demands. Age-related degradation of executive functions can, however, lead to volition problems that compromise flexible adjustment of behavior. In contrast, the reliance on habitual control has been shown to remain relatively intact in later life and may therefore provide an expedient route to goal attainment among older adults. In the current study, we examine whether a metacognitive self-help intervention (MCSI), aimed at facilitating goal striving through the gradual automatization of efficient routines, could effectively support behavioral adaptability in favor of resilience among older adults with and without (sub-clinical) mental health problems. Methods This metacognitive strategy draws on principles from health and social psychology, as well as clinical psychology, and incorporates elements of established behavioral change and activation techniques from both fields. Additionally, the intervention will be tailored to personal needs and challenges, recognizing the significant diversity that exist among aging individuals. Discussion Despite some challenges that may limit the generalizability of the results, our MCSI program offers a promising means to empower older adults with tools and strategies to take control of their goals and challenges. This can promote autonomy and independent functioning, and thereby contribute to adaptability and resilience in later life. Trial registration Pre-registered, partly retrospectively. This study was pre-registered before the major part of the data was collected, created, and realized. Only a small part of the data of some participants (comprising the baseline and other pre-intervention measures), and the full dataset of the first few participants, was collected prior to registration, but it was not accessed yet.

      "title": "Individual and collective reflection: how to meet the needs of development in teaching",
      "abstract": "The following five core ideas explain how learning organizations function as wholes. The core ideas are central when school is examined as a learning organization. Personal mastery, mental models, team learning, shared visions and system thinking offer different angles to examine the organization. (1) Personal mastery. Without personal commitment, development is impossible. A community and an individual cannot be directed from outside. Growing means ultimately the ability to let other people grow. (2) Various deeply rooted mental models, ways of thinking and seeing things direct our daily behaviour. When evaluating teaching, the most essential thing is not to value the product only, but to value the mental processes. Individual and group reflection skills are needed there. (3) Shared vision. Appreciating views other than one's own is the most important key success factor of a team. All team members should commit themselves to sharing the vision. This presupposes plenty of discourse in the organization, because commitment cannot be imposed. (4) Team learning. The ability to genuinely learn and work together is a challenge. Collective reflection and regarding other people as esteemed colleagues fosters a good atmosphere, gives time and space to other people and will lead to a deeper understanding than one person alone can attain. (5) In systemic thinking the background is formed by system and theories. We are directed logically to only a minor extent. System thinking binds the other core factors together. This research has focused on personal mastery and mental models. The phenomena of individual and collective reflection and their prerequisites were investigated. The target group was a sample of teacher trainees in vocational teacher education. Familiarization with systematic reflection and adopting the usage of it led to a conscious professional approach, empowerment and aptness for life‐long learning. Die folgenden fünf Kern‐Vorstellungen erklären, wie Lernorganisationen als Ganze funktionieren. Diese Kern‐Vorstellungen sind von zentraler Bedeutung, wenn Schule selbst als eine lernende Organisation beurteilt wird. Persönliche Erkenntnis, Denk‐Modelle, soziales Lernen, gemeinsame Vision und System‐Denken bieten verschiedene Sichtweisen, diese Lernorganisationen zu prüfen. (1) Persönliche Erkenntnis. Ohne persönliches Engagement ist Entwicklung unmöglich. Eine Gemeinschaft und ein Individuum können nicht von außen gesteuert werden. Heranwachsen bedeutet schließlich die Fähigkeit, andere Leute an sich selbst wachsen zu lassen. (2) Verschieden tief verwurzelte Denk‐Modelle, Denkweisen und Ansichten bestimmen unser tägliches Verhalten. Bei Bewerten des Unterrichtens, gilt es nicht allein das Endprodukt zu bewerten, sondern auch die Denk‐Prozesse für die Lösungswege. Es werden Fertigkeiten der individuellen Umsetzung und kollektiver Reflexion nötig sein. (3) Gemeinsame Vision. Der wichtigste Schlüssel zum Erfolg für Lernen im Team ist die Akzeptanz unterschiedlicher Ansichten als die eigenen. Alle Mitglieder der Gruppe sollten zu den unterschiedlichen Ansichten Stellung beziehen. Dies setzt eine Fülle von Sachgesprächen in der Lernorganisation voraus, sonst ist kein Engagement zu erwarten. (4) Lernen im Team. Die Fähigkeit, mit einander zu lernen und zu arbeiten, ist eine echte Herausforderung. Kollektive Reflexion, gute Zusammenarbeit unter Kollegen, Wert legen auf gute Atmosphäre, gibt Zeit und Raum zu anderen Menschen, und wird zu einem tieferen Verständnis führen, als je ein Einzelner es erlangen kann. (5) Das systemische Denken beruft sich auf System‐ und Chaos‐Theorie. Wir sind nur zu einem geringen Teil durch Logik gesteuert. Das Systemdenken verbindet die. Hauptfaktoren unseres Denkens. Diese Forschung konzentrierte sich auf persönlicher Erkenntnis und Denkmodellen. Die Phänomene individueller und kollektiver Reflexion und deren Anfangsbedingungen wurden untersucht. Die Zielgruppe waren Lehramtskandidaten in der Berufsschullehrer‐Ausbildung. Die Gewöhnung an systematische Reflexion und deren Aneignung führte zu berufsbezogener Methode, Befähigung, Bevollmächtigung und Tauglichkeit zu lebenslangem Lernen.",

      "abstract": "Vocational choice and realization of one’s personal potential as a professional is an expression of profound study of personality structure and its interaction with the environment. The source of management and engineering and technical personnel in organizations and enterprises is represented by young graduates. At each stage of education on-the-job training for students is performed jointly with basic enterprises and organizations on the principle of combining studies with practical training in the form of part-time employment. By learning their own personal qualities young professionals will adapt to the work environment and will have the best opportunity to realize their potential at the job. According to the personality type classification suggested by American psychologist J. Holland [1], there are six psychological types: Realistic, Investigative, Social, Conventional, Enterprising, and Artistic. Each type is characterized by certain features of temperament, character, etc. Therefore a certain psychological type of personality corresponds to the occupation that allows a person to succeed. This method can be adjusted and used for recruitment and selection of personnel, it is also assumed to assist in the work of human resources. Compliance with qualifications required when entering employment is an important and decisive factor in selection of candidates for the vacant position. This method of determining personality types suggested by John Holland [1] as an additional assessment when entering employment will help to determine more accurately the employee´s adequacy for the job. Moreover it reduces the costs associated with the selection and evaluation of personnel, saves time required in order to understand whether employee is suitable for the position or not. This technique will help young professionals to adapt to working environment professionally and solve social and psychological problems.",

They expect something different from what they are doing at that moment or they think that what they are doing is inadequate; they get stuck, they get caught in negative and confused thoughts. Objectives Even if a finished object or image is obtained, the research pursues, first of all, the way and the extent to which the creative process and execution of the artifact contributes to the improvement or healing of the studied beneficiaries. Correlative objective being the increase of their quality of life and their socio-professional integration. In assessing the motor functions of the beneficiaries, it is essential that the emphasis is placed on the outstanding and hidden motor abilities of each individual. The aim is to improve: coordination disorders, spatialization disorders, fine motor skills, sensoriality, creativity, socialization. Methods ORGANIZATION OF ACTIVITIES is done in three types of workshops, with different objectives and interventions, - Occupational therapy workshop in the category that includes art therapy. - Occupational therapy - Relaxation, play therapy CASE STUDY: Placement center Jucu PA, sex M, 16 years old. Diagnosis: Secular infantile encephalopathy, behavioral disorders - heteroaggressiveness, severe mental retardation, alalia. - Uses modeling for self-expression and self-fulfillment. During work, he is not aggressive and relates to people who appreciate his work. An advanced level is observed in modeling, even compared to normal people. Spatial abstract compositions from plasticine, expressive and balanced, are made at the beginning, the evolution is observed in the modeling of the figures (he starts to model personalized human figures), which he pairs chromatically, groups them into dancing figures, or groups them affectively and vertically. He also showed changes in his behavior: he smiled while working, clapped and recognized us when we entered the workshop, wanted to be photographed and petted (although normally he can’t stand being touched). He showed interest in the camera and in the modeling works of other children from Placement center. Results Work in visual arts and design therapies aims to create a product. The benefits arise from experiences based on artistic creativity: materializing ideas and solving unexpected results. Image 1: Image 2: Image 3: Conclusions The artistic image becomes significant in strengthening the verbal exchange between the beneficiary and the art therapist, solving problems and formulating new perceptions that in turn lead to positive changes, growth and healing.

According to one approach, suggested by according to one approach, there are three main EFs; inhibition, shifting, and updating of working memory. EFs are important, in part because of their ability to predict clinical, educational, and functional outcomes. However, EFs have been assessed using a range of cognitive tasks and behavioural rating measures. This chapter will provide an overview of a range of executive function assessments used to assess EFs in childhood, with a focus on inhibition, shifting, and updating of working memory. It will consider the measurement properties of these tools, including data relating to reliability and validity. The measures will then be considered in terms of their suitability for different purposes and in relation to their use with children of different ages and abilities.",

      "abstract": "This article is designed to open a conversation about the place of spirituality in social work, highlight possible ethical issues, and question whether spirituality, as defined by social work and popular culture, is an immutable part of human development. Additionally, the role of social work in conducting spiritual assessments and interventions is specifically challenged, along with examples of how the misuse of spirituality can harm clients. The article also suggests that the profession would benefit from adopting an evidence-based concept of spirituality and establishing accountability standards. Findings: Until more is known about spirituality, social workers may want to consider: (1) placing a moratorium on using and developing spiritual assessment instruments until the concept can be accurately defined; (2) omitting words linked to religious symbols such as soul, anointing, blessing, etc. in social work practice; (3) conducting spiritual screenings rather than complete spiritual assessments, and (4) referring clients with spiritual questions or wanting spiritual support to experts known not to blame or harm clients and trained in the specific area of concerns expressed by the person. Applications. The time has come for social work to establish ethics, accountability, and limitations on the practice of spirituality.",

Life in the 21st century demands a person to master a range of skills. One of the important skills in the 21st century is critical thinking skill. This study focuses on the definition, importance, challenges in developing indicators and assessment of critical thinking skills. Critical thinking skill is the ability to think logically, reflectively, productively and systematically appeared in making consideration and making the best decision. Critical thinking skills are beneficial in improving the analysis skill, creativity, ability to make use of ideas or information, and looking for information skill as well as self-reflection. Learning can do the development of learnersâ€™ critical thinking skills. An important indicator in the critical thinking skills is interpreting which about an ability dealing with studying or analyzing, identifying the relevant or irrelevant sources, identifying and evaluating the assumptions, implementing various strategies to make the appropriate decisions, summarizing and regulating themselves.",

      "title": "HALF A CENTURY ON THE WAY TO NEW ACHIEVEMENTS (TO THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY OF KUBAN STATE UNIVERSITY)",
      "abstract": "The paper examines three scientific approaches to psychological analysis of personality development: the subjective approach (S. L. Rubinstein), the dynamic approach (L. I. Antsyferova), and the subjective-existential approach (Z. I. Ryabikina and colleagues). The author discloses the fundamental aspects of a procedural approach in addressing complex life challenges. The objective of the research is to substantiate a statement on the nature of human life, which is typically manifested in a multitude of challenging life situations experienced simultaneously and/or successively by an individual. A challenging situation is defined as a process comprising multiple stages, linked to the subject's past experiences of addressing life difficulties, serving as a marker of their current tasks, and oriented towards the achievement of future objectives. The individual components of the situation include the contradiction between needs and external requirements, the reasons that caused this contradiction, the capabilities and resources of the individual, the plan for resolving the situation, and the presence or absence of a forecast of its consequences, both negative and positive. The strategies of coping with difficulties reflect authentic methods of overcoming them and prospective tasks of personal development. This paper presents arguments in favor of the procedural approach and the possibility of its application to the analysis of everyday and extreme stressors. It is shown that there is no violation of personal dynamics even in the case of regressive changes in the behavior of an individual who has experienced a psycho-traumatic situation; an opinion is expressed on the need to study the specificity of personality development in conditions of intensive stressors, as well as the opportunities and resources that ensure a change in the pace of development, leading to the improvement of the subject's well-being and his/her reintegration into society. The research employed the methods of analysis, synthesis, and analogy as cognitive procedures, which permitted the validation of the hypothesis that a challenging life situation can be considered an ontological basis for the development of personality. The conclusion is that the studies conducted by colleagues from Kuban State University (the Department of Personality Psychology and General Psychology) and by researchers at the Institute of Psychology of the Russian Academy of Sciences shared a common methodological basis. The theoretical and empirical studies reflected different aspects of multifaceted problems in personality psychology and the subject's psychology.",

These four broad capacities are not unique to humans, but are probably uniquely developed in human brains by virtue of the expansion of the prefrontal cortex (this formulation is based on Chapter 1 of my book, Braintrust : What neuroscience tells us about morality ).",

Resistance entails therapeutically a gradual elaboration of unconscious, preconscious, and partially conscious experience. Refusal manifests as a willful nonparticipation in offering or responding to material that can be symbolized. All communication has an element of refusal, which occurs at various levels of persistence, intensity, and legitimacy. Clinical examples are provided to discriminate refusal from resistance proper, and to describe three categories of mental and group experience, (a) refusal to perceive external experience; (b) refusal to think about what one knows, and (c) refusal to think about what one does not know. Therapeutic impasses may relate to limitations of the therapist's creativity and flexibility in thinking about and dealing with refusals, including one's own.",

A review of the literature indicates, not surprisingly, (a) the content-related knowledge of children is often related positively to academic performance; (b) situations exist, however, in which children's knowledge can affect performance on some types of tasks more than others, or in which knowledge can have a deleterious effect on performance; (c) the ability to access knowledge can be a problem, especially in certain content areas and for certain types of children; (d) types of knowledge other than content knowledge, such as metacognitive, can have a substantial impact on academic performance. The literature on strategies indicates that strategic competency is related to changes in the structure and efficiency of strategies with development, the context in which the strategies are used, and the ability to apply and regulate the use of strategies. The implications of some of these data for assessment and consultation with teachers about instruction are discussed.",

      "title": "On complexity and variability of individuals’ day-to-day discretionary activities",
      "abstract": "Considering an individual’s day-to-day variability of activity-travel patterns will provide a more complete description of how an individual behaves to adapt the changing constraints and resources on different days. Without this day-to-day variability understanding, the individual’s behaviour would not be fully grasped and any suggested policy, planning and development would not completely achieve their desired objectives. The day-to-day behaviour is a subject to an interaction between individual’s needs and time-space constraints. The availability of ‘external’ resources (e.g., disposable income, built environment accessibility, and access to different travel mode/s) gives more opportunities for some individuals to participate in certain activities and/or trips than others. The constraints do not only consider budget and time constraints, but also include how an individual associates with other individuals and materials, and complies with any given authorities’ rules and regulations. The needs-constraints interaction also unveils some endogeneities which may not be captured by microeconomic and attitude theories. Failing to understand these interactions will underestimate the individual’s complex decision making process for performing certain behaviour.The constraints are not solely about physical constraints and instrumental factors, such as travel mode availability, time and cost. It is also influenced by individual’s non-instrumental variables, such as motivation, volition and habits. Currently there is a lack of knowledge how these non-instrumental variables are interacting and influencing the constraints to shape the individual’s travel behaviour. The implementation of certain activity-travel policy which only focuses in giving more opportunities to an individual within time and space resources without considering an individual’s attitude and/or habit may not be well accepted and followed by member of public. Moreover, the integration also reveals how an individual puts different priority on different potential activities based on the how an individual allocates/does not allocate time in engaging certain activities when having strong commitment and intention. In addition, including an individual’s health condition in the analysis may help in coordinating certain public health related policy with activity-travel policy.This thesis includes six papers which investigated the factors described above. The first three papers investigated how activity participation and built environment variables which can represent individuals’ constraints explain the day-to-day variability of individuals’ behaviours. Furthermore, the fourth and fifth paper explored the interaction between individuals’ time-use and activity participation, subjective characteristics and health factors. Lastly, the sixth paper examined how the time-space constraints and health condition explain the degree of variability in individuals’ multi-facet and multi-dimensional activity-travel patterns using sequential alignment method.",

One’s growth mindset comprises a variety of cognitive and motivational factors (e.g., learning goals, effort beliefs) and the perception that skill attainment and outcome in any domain are tethered to personal effort. A fixed mindset encompasses goals, beliefs, and perceptions that skill level is not malleable or impacted by effort. Structural equation models tested investigated direct and indirect pathways of mindset and motivational variables (i.e., learning goals, effort beliefs) with reading outcomes (i.e., word reading, fluency, reading comprehension) in a diverse sample of fourth grade students ( n = 408) with reading difficulties. Results revealed a direct impact of fixed mindset (−0.21 to −0.36) and effort beliefs (0.18–0.31) on all standardized, reading-based outcomes. There were no significant mediating pathways. Results are juxtaposed to other research in this area, and practical implications are discussed. Growth mindset appears a robust predictor of positive academic outcomes, and it may be beneficial to facilitate growth mindset in classrooms.",

The diagnosis of dementia, like other mental illnesses, carries significant stigma, partly due to cultural beliefs about etiology but also due to the unsocial behaviors that can result from cognitive impairment. Stigma not only affects self-esteem and causes distress, but affects social inclusion and can delay diagnosis of dementia. In order to optimize the uptake of early intervention healthcare initiatives and improve outcomes, we need to explore the effectiveness of antistigma interventions. Reducing stigma may be achieved through education, protest against current inequalities and contact with people who have dementia. Successful interventions are likely to involve a multifaceted approach that tackles self-stigma as well as public perceptions. Future research should explore the creation of culturally sensitive antistigma interventions and examine which aspects of these programs are most effective and easiest to implement.",

In appearance, these labours seem comfortable and rested, which contrasts with the discomfort and fatigue that manifest who plays them.

      "abstract": "Predicting someone's longevity requires looking at a broad variety of circumstances, making it a difficult and multidimensional task. There are a number of important factors that must be taken into account from a substantive perspective in order to provide an accurate prediction of life expectancy. Life expectancy is not a constant that can be calculated from a person's genes or other unchangeable characteristics. Instead, it is affected by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social elements, any of which may play a greater or lesser role depending on the context. For instance, lifestyle variables like smoking, alcohol use, and exercise levels, as well as access to healthcare, nutrition, and clean water, may all have a substantial influence on life expectancy. It is difficult to estimate a person's lifespan without considering a broad variety of characteristics, such as their socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and way of life. Life expectancy prediction is a regression issue rather than a classification problem, however both linear regression and decision tree classification are useful machine learning approaches for making predictions. In this study, we apply a machine learning strategy to the problem of life expectancy prediction utilising linear regression and decision tree classification methods. According to the findings, the Decision Tree Classifier obtained 92% accuracy while the Linear Regression Classifier reached 96% accuracy.",

This chapter explores the question of whether the attention orienting response to social cues is unique by reviewing cognitive/behavioral findings. The chapter proposes that current taxonomies do not adequately capture the construct of social orienting and present an adapted framework that is more elaborate in classifying both the degree to which orienting is consciously controlled and the extent to which learning and experience play a role in the acquisition of the social orienting response. The chapter then reviews neuro-imaging and developmental findings (including specific examples of atypical development; autism and schizophrenia) in order to ascertain whether the proposed framework is supported by findings from these research disciplines.",

      "abstract": "The nature and causes of mental health problems are contested. The dominant approach in services views them as \"illnesses like any other\". The structure, legislative base and practices of mainstream mental health services are largely predicated on this idea, known variously as the medical, illness, disease or diagnostic model. By contrast, psychosocial theories highlight the role of the events and circumstances of peoples' lives. The tension between these two approaches can lead to challenges and dilemmas for psychosocially oriented practitioners. Clinical psychologists participated in interviews and a focus group about these challenges and how they managed them. A grounded theory was constructed which suggested that their responses took three forms: openly \"dissenting\" (conflict), strategically \"stepping into\" the medical model (compromise), or inadvertently \"slipping\" into it (colluding). Strategies for managing the challenges included focusing on clients; foregrounding clients' contexts and understandings; holding the tension between \"expert\" and \"not-knowing\" approaches; using ordinary language; forging robust working relationships; being mindful of difference and of constraints on colleagues; recognising one's power and ability to influence; self-care and work/life balance; taking encouragement from small changes; consolidating a personal philosophy; mutual support and solidarity; drawing on scholarship and finally engaging in activism outside work.",

      "title": "Teaching Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills",
      "abstract": "Abstract Critical is a learned skill that requires instruction and practice. Business education instructors at both secondary and post-secondary levels can enhance students' critical skills by (1) using instructional strategies that actively engage students in process rather than relying on lecture and rote memorization, (2) focusing instruction on process of rather than solely on content, and (3) using assessment techniques that provide students with an intellectual challenge rather than memory recall. Several barriers can impede critical instruction. Lack of training, limited resources, biased preconceptions, and time constraints conspire negate environments that promote critical thinking. However, actively engaging students in project-based or collaborative activities can encourage students' critical development if instructors model process, use effective questioning techniques, and guide students' critical processes. The examples provided challenge instructors of students as users of information rather than receivers of information. It is possible store mind with a million facts and still be entirely uneducated. -Alec Bourne Introduction What is critical thinking, and why is so important? The Critical Thinking Community defined critical as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide belief and action (Scriven & Paul, 2007, p. 1). Critical has also been referred as metacognition (Tempelaar, 2006) or process of about thinking as defined and originally purposed by Flavell (1979). Critical skills are important because they enable students to deal effectively with social, scientific, and practical (Shakirova, 2007, p. 42). Simply put, students who are able critically are able solve problems effectively. Merely having knowledge or information is not enough. To be effective in workplace (and in their personal lives), students must be able solve problems make effective decisions; they must be able critically. Critical is not a new concept. Throughout nearly 300 years of policymaking in United States, educators have promoted eight broad goals of schooling: basic academic skills, critical and problem solving, social skills and work ethic, citizenship, physical health, emotional health, arts and literature, and preparation for skilled (Rothstein, Wilder, & Jacobsen, 2007, p. 8). Business education directly addresses work ethic and preparation for skilled employment as well as critical and problem solving. Yet many teachers continually struggle engage students in critical activities (Tempelaar, 2006), and students seldom use critical skills solve complex, real-world problems (Bartlett, 2002; Rippin, Booth, Bowie, & Jordan, 2002). Why? The answer may be in our instructional methods. Two quotes that are often cited together reflect this supposition (as cited by Schaf ersman, 1991). First, Clement (1979) stated that should be teaching students how think. Instead, we are teaching them what think (p. 1). Second, Norman (1981) noted that it is strange that we expect students learn, yet seldom teach them anything about learning (p. 1). Although content is important, process of how students learn material is equally important. Therefore, purpose of this article is analyze and synthesize secondary research provide best practices for incorporating critical instructional methods into business education classrooms at both secondary and post-secondary levels. …",

      "title": "Difficulties and Motivation of Postgraduate Students in Selected Nigerian Universities",
      "abstract": "Introduction Motivation energizes people to overcome setbacks. Study motivation helps students to stay focused and psychologically empowered to overcome obstacles and difficulties during study. Motivation drives students to achieve goals. Postgraduate students should be interested in the area of study and full of enthusiasm that should not wane as the study advances and as problems are confronted. One theory of motivation is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow identified lower needs that have to be met before higher needs at the top. The starting point of Maslow's hierarchy theory is that people have needs that must be satisfied in the following order: * Physiological: food, sleep, etc. * Safety: Stable environment relatively free from threats * Social: Affectionate relations with others and status within a group. * Esteem: Self-respect, self-esteem, and the esteem of others; desire for confidence, competence, achievement, mastery, recognition, and reputation. * Self-actualization: Self-fulfilment The Nigerian postgraduate student may desire to move up the hierarchy to attain the level of self-actualization but this progress may be hindered by difficulties which could hamper the desire, zeal, and goal. Apart from these areas of needs in Maslow's theory that postgraduate students must overcome, this study will also look at other difficulties and obstacles confronting Nigerian postgraduates students in the areas of * Prolonged semesters or sessions due to strikes and student unrest * Getting research materials * Interaction between lecturers and students. * The need to for understanding and knowledge to satisfy curiosity, explore, and discover and to find solutions, look for relationships, and seek intellectual challenges. * The postgraduate student needs self-fulfilment, development, and use of potentials. The Nigerian Postgraduate Student and Maslow's Theory Motivation is key to overcoming difficulties and setbacks in the postgraduate level. Postgraduate students must take initiative in seeking resources, assistance, managing time, and forming good reading habits. Postgraduate education must motivate students to serious work. University authorities and other stakeholders in Nigerian postgraduate education systems must consider student needs in the hierarchical order. Priorities should be given to these motivational needs so that postgraduate students can reach their potential. Problems include: * Lack of study time * Poor use of study time * Procrastination * Lack of good study space Postgraduate students also influence motivation through factors such as desire, values, and beliefs that make them act. Postgraduate study is a goal-oriented venture and value is attached to it (Wilkinson 2006). In considering issues such as family relationships, grades, career, aspiration, achievement status, money, and social life, the postgraduate student gradually understands motivational needs. Goals and desires grow from values and beliefs. Motivation is related to commitment. Postgraduate students must be committed to good study habits and staying motivated. Activism and some aspects of social life may have to wait, even if these are part of students' values, beliefs, and pleasures. Maintaining Motivation and Goals Postgraduate students must realize their strengths and weaknesses. Informal assessment of ability should be done, along with reflection on lectures and discussion with lecturers and fellow students. Reading and writing skills should be self-assessed and critiqued. This prevents under-estimation or over- estimation of one's skills and helps in attaining goals. The establishment of both short- and long-term personal goals is crucial. Postgraduate students often aim toward a particular project, degree, graduate program, and professional career. …",

While traditional intelligence is crucial for life success, emotional intelligence is vital in fostering relationships and achieving goals within the human world built on connections. Through various measures, individuals can self-observe and comfortably understand emotions, social perceptions, and others' behavior, even in challenging scenarios. This leads to improved self-control, enhanced social decision-making, and ultimately elevates success rates. Effective success depends on heightened awareness, self-emotion regulation, and understanding others. This study explores the correlation between leadership programs and students' emotional intelligence development. Existing research emphasizes the link between emotional intelligence and academic success, yet there's a dearth of studies on its evolution among students. Qualitative data highlights students' most impactful components: mandatory workshops, teamwork, and the shared cohort experience. These elements significantly contribute to emotional intelligence development in students.",

The severity of the effects can range from minor importance to major significance depending on the situation. In this presentation I use a meta-analysis of previous studies on cognitive dissonance and use information from current personality science. I inspect the varying effects from and situations where dissension is present, and also examine the relationship between this dissonance and how we conceive our idea of self. My aim is to use the science behind the conception of self and its relation to cognitive dissonance to help promote well-being. Applying concepts of awareness, nonattachment to thought, and alternative views of self can potentially help with our problems resulting from cognitive dissonance and promote more optimal personal development.",

SCRDs are often used in the fields of school psychology and special education because they are highly flexible and allow empirical inquiry to determine \"what works\" with an individual student, a class, or a school. A1-B1-A2-B2 designs involve multiple introductions and removals of the intervention, along with the measurement of the dependent variable multiple times during each phase, to determine the relationship between the two variables. Using an A1-B1-A2-B2 design, Miller, Dufrene, Olmi, Tingstrom, and Filce examined the impact of self-monitoring as a viable fading option in check-in/check-out. ALTs involve the implementation of multiple interventions during the same phase, allowing researchers to draw inferences about the relative effectiveness of each intervention.",

Communicative competence includes informative components, emotional components and social perception. Social perception is provided by such psychological mechanisms as identification, empathy and reflexion. Professional communication breaks down under the influence of emotional stress, leading to the formation of “emotional burnout syndrome” in a nurse. The negative role of a nurse’s perfectionism and other psychological characteristics in the occurrence of chronic emotional overload is shown. Mental self-regulation, cheerfulness and optimism as well as a wide “role repertoire”, flexibility and plasticity of a nurse’s behavior serve as a preventive measure of professional stress. It has been shown that a condition for the effectiveness of a nurse’s professional activity is her own psychological comfort and positive emotional attitude.",

Quantum thinking can serve as a meaningful way to respond to the ever-changing demands of medical education. Quantum thinking does not work on a theoretical model rather as a disposition of thinking and action, which is supported through curiosity, flexibility, and reflective practice. Quantum thinking provides ways to cope with uncertainty without causing inaction, to rethink assumptions prevailing for a long time, and act intentionally in a system that is all too often in routine. In doing so, quantum thinking supports a more responsive, humane, and dynamic vision of medical education.",

      "abstract": "Several themes have run through this book. Social work is a stressful and difficult, if not impossible, profession. Practitioners are required to work within disturbing, sometimes violent situations, with people who are severely disadvantaged and deprived materially and emotionally. Social workers regularly confront practice dilemmas; the necessity of having to take difficult decisions, in which there are no right answers, based on a delicate assessment of risks, needs and competing (if not conflicting) rights; and a myriad of pressures, including from within. The result is a complex maze and interaction of personal, professional, interagency and societal dynamics and pressures, and potential tangles between service-users, social workers, agencies and society. Figure P.1 attempts to represent diagrammatically how this complexity can lock all the participants into a closed system, individually and interpersonally, within and between. Workers bring to the task their personal and professional experience which may, via transference and projection, disrupt the helping encounter. What clients bring may trigger and provoke reactions in the workers (countertransference). Finally, societal attitudes — for example, ageism, intolerance of difference, conflicts in explanations for child abuse or heterosexism — are avoided or deflected through social work.",

      "abstract": "LEARNING IS A NATURAL process, a set of activities which occurs within the individual at both conscious and unconscious levels. It begins in response to a need to be met, a problem to be solved, specific life conditions to be coped with, a desire to be achieved, or just plain curiosity. It can initiate change or be a response to inner or outer changes in the physical, social, emotional, mental, or physiological aspects of daily life. Learning results in changes in the meanings an individual uses to make sense of life experiences; in the skills and strategies she or he uses for acting on, reacting to and interacting with other persons and life events; and in the values and attitudes which affect actions and intentions. Learning involves a sequence of cyclical and repetitive activities, some of which can be observed by others but most of which can be experienced and known only by the individual learner.' Learning, as described in this article, is assumed to be a process under the control and direction of the learner, but influenced by interactions with others. Librarians, for example, have a unique opportunity to influence learning activities by providing the material resources and human services to assist learners as they extract information and ideas through reading, hearing or seeing the meanings and values which others have given to life experiences. This description of learning offers a number of basic ideas which are fundamental to understanding the learner-centered approaches proposed in other articles in this journal.

      "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to set the stage for a discussion of the status of the idea of psychological process within psychological explanations and descriptions, indicating some of its consequences for the teaching of psychology. i t is argued that contemporary psychology espouses some form of modularity, which, in turn, reveals commitments to a particular variety of cognitive architecture. The assumption of modularity has been a fruitful approach in some areas (e. g. the study of perception), but it has also led to a piecemeal understanding of mind and behavior that is simply insufficient to provide foundations for professional practice in several areas of psychology (e. g. education). Whereas assuming weak modularity as a working hypothesis might be a useful and necessary research strategy, integrating psychological research findings into a coherent framework is necessary. This idea has important consequences for the teaching of psychology.",

      "title": "Entering Freshmen Hindered by Functional Illiteracy.",
      "abstract": "Research has specifically linked dropping out of school to reading disabilities and related problems. Research on reading as a cognitive task has focused on reading as an active process with three questions of concern: (1) How does the learner learn to identify the printed word?; (2) How does he or she discriminate one word from another word?; and (3) How does he or she recognize a word upon seeing it again in a different context? Other research indicates that poor readers may have been created by present reading programs. The disabled reader is probably a disabled reader because he or she is introduced to words at an ever-increasing rate, and he or she finds it harder and harder to make the fine discriminations required to identify the words. Jein Piaget's theory of schemata consists of a framework for tying together the information about any given concept or event. As he defines it, long-term memory has three dimensions: (1) episodic or personal memory and semantic memory; (2) conceptual data hierarchy; and (3) stratification construct, which includes the production, retrieving, and using of these hierarchies, the organizing framework of schemata. Reading theorists suggest that nonor poor-readers who are inconsistent and inflexible In reading need direct teaching of more skills, more thorough initial input, and more reteaching and review than normal readers. But a constant problem is how to get the slow reader to work on the same words or sound-symbol associations over and over, how to keep interest high while slowing down the pace long enough to achieve mastery of skills. More research is needed in the area of the two types of learners identifiP4 by Piaget, the global-analytic and the reflective-impulsive. (Forty-two references are attached.)

While depression and other psychological symptoms are not necessarily 'caused' by interpersonal problems, they do occur in a social and interpersonal context. Problem areas commonly associated with the onset of depression are unresolved grief, interpersonal disputes, role transition and interpersonal deficits such as social isolation.This article discusses IPC and how it can be used in the general practice setting.The structure of IPC is of a brief treatment of six sessions, each with an explicit focus: assessment, education about the interaction between interpersonal relationships and psychological symptoms, identifying current stress areas and helping the patient deal with these more positively and termination of the IPC relationship. Interpersonal counselling can be utilised general practice to reduce psychological symptoms, restore morale, improve self esteem and the quality of the patient's social adjustment and interpersonal relationships.",

      "abstract": "In terms of progressive social transformations have changed requirements for the professional personality. In particular, to ensure professional achievements it is necessary to : be ready to make independent, fast, effective decisions; ability to analyze alternatives; the implementation of influence, etc. There is an urgent need to improve the overall content of professional competence. One of the most effective ways is the implementation of leadership principles in the structure of professional competence.\r\nThe traditional view of scientists (teachers and psychologists) on the structure of professional competence involves the incorporation of certain components: motivational, cognitive, behavioral, emotionally-regulatory and others. J. Raven has developed a model of professional competence, originality which is associated with the recognition of the heterogeneity of the key factors and the cumulative nature of its main components. The author first emphasizes the ability of a competent individual to achieve significant goals and be largely independent of the social environment. So, it´s about leadership potential – socially-psychological properties of personality, which reflects the ability of the individual , regardless of the situation successfully implement leadership in professional activities. J. Raven attempted to embed leadership potential in the structure of professional competence highlighting important aspects of leadership behavior: achievement, cooperation and impact, and analyzing different types of competencies, included in the professional competence.",

Hence a typology of practices (psychoanalytic, biological, systemic, cognitivebehavioural and general) and their conformity with the underlying theoretical models (psychological, medical-biological, social, eclectic) is demonstrated. Overall these relationships are close; differences between types of therapeutic practices and models of reference are nevertheless frequent. Other aspects related more or less directly to these theoretical references are analysed from the same perspective: the degree of information psychiatrists possess in the different domains of psychiatry, their interests, the professional reading matter which they prefer and their membership of learned societies or professional and social associations. If on these subjects significant differences distinguish the therapeutic profiles, this cannot be said of replies to questions concerning the stakes in psychiatry (training, priorities and future development). The consequences of these results on the collaboration between representatives of the different therapeutic profiles are discussed, as well as questions related to eclecticism and the integration of different models in an new conceptual synthesis.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Research that focuses on the emotional, mental, behavioral and cognitive capabilities of individuals has been abundant within disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and anthropology, among others. However, when facing complex problems, a new perspective to understand individuals is necessary. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an agent-based model and simulation to gain understanding on the decision-making and problem-solving abilities of individuals. Design/Methodology/approach: The micro-level analysis modeling and simulation paradigm Agent-Based Modeling Through the use of Agent-Based Modeling, insight is gained on how different individuals with different profiles deal with complex problems. Using previous literature from different bodies of knowledge, established theories and certain assumptions as input parameters, a model is built and executed through a computer simulation. Findings: The results indicate that individuals with certain profiles have better capabilities to deal with complex problems. Moderate profiles could solve the entire complex problem, whereas profiles within extreme conditions could not. This indicates that having a strong predisposition is not the ideal way when approaching complex problems, and there should always be a component from the other perspective. The probability that an individual may use these capabilities provided by the opposite predisposition provides to be a useful option. Originality/value: The originality of the present research stems from how individuals are profiled, and the model and simulation that is built to understand how they solve complex problems. The development of the agent-based model adds value to the existing body of knowledge within both social sciences, and modeling and simulation.",

      "abstract": "Assessment is ubiquitous, we assess almost every moment of our daily lives to make decisions about our activities and, in the educational context, our work and our understandings. Understanding assessment theories and practices, particularly inclusive, learner-centred practices explicitly, is an efficient means of empowering and enabling the next generation to have the courage to challenge injustices in all levels and contexts of life. Shared explicit, transparent assessment processes can and should be put into practice in order to support learning and make a socially equitable difference.\r\nAssessment theories are varied and uncoordinated and pose a challenge to unravel. This paper analyses and evaluates different theoretical positions in international Anglophone research in order to ascertain how best practice can be supported for learner-inclusive assessment. \r\nThe evaluation of assessment theories demonstrates that the main definitions of assessment (including summative and formative assessment) are viewed from two different perspectives: one bases these on the processes of assessment while the other on functions of assessment. How these assessment theories may be reconciled is also examined. In practice, these differences tend to be reflected in explicit procedures when definitions are linked to processes, and to implicit procedures when definitions are based on functions of assessment.\r\nThese different assessment perspectives result in very different consequences for the roles and responsibilities of students and tutors, and how learning may be viewed and supported. Clarifying assessment issues has huge impact on both learning and teaching practices, and ultimately, on how society envisages justice.",

      "title": "Why do people fail to act? Situational barriers and constraints on ecological behavior",
      "abstract": "The lack of success in dealing with the inconsistency between positive attitudes and ecological behaviors, and in explaining why people fail to act pro-environmentally is still widespread in practice and research. In our view, this has to do with three main reasons: 1) A positivity fallacy the belief shared by many researchers and practitioners that as long as people have the right (or positive) attitudes, intentions, skills, information, etc., the right proecological action should follow; thus, they disregard the importance of negative determinants in explaining the attitude-behavior inconsistency. 2) Lack of a psychological level of explanation; even when negative determinants are considered, the psychological explanation is often disregarded or incompletely identified, with most of the factors identified being socio-economical, or urban planning and architectural, etc. However, factors explaining why people fail to act can also be viewed within a psychological level of explanation, with behavior considered to be the result of an interaction between contextual variables and psychological processes. 3) Underestimation of the unconscious processes influence; contextual effects on behavior can be mediated not only by conscious perception but also by cognitive processes of which people are not aware of. Given these reasons, a model of psychological barriers and constraints is proposed (DN-Work model; “Didn’t work”) trying to integrate negative determinants within a psychological explanatory model of proecological behavior. This model aims to represent a process view regarding how a conflict between pro-ecological and anti-ecological behavioral goals can be produced, given the presence of two types of barriers and constraints: a) perceived barriers and constraints, and b) unconscious barriers and constraints. We briefly present two studies based on this model. These studies address habit accessibility as an unconscious behavioral barrier on ecological decisions to buy organic products, mediated by the effect of behavioral-goals activation from the situation. _________________________________________ *CORRESPONDENCE: RUI GASPAR DE CARVALHO, Faculdade de Psicologia e Ciencias da Educacao, Universidade de Lisboa, Alameda da Universidade, 1649-013 Lisboa, Portugal.

En este articulo se examinan los factores que influyen en la eleccion de unos determinados estudios y se analiza la dinamica de la toma de decisiones incluyendo los conflictos que, a menudo, surgen ante varias alternativas.",

      "abstract": "For those aiming to improve the social competence of others, the choice is usually between shaping specific micro-skills or more general problem-solving. While these are not mutually exclusive in practice, research has tended to investigate them separately. One of the major issues facing those targeting micro-skills is their validity in the setting of concern. For those targeting problemsolving, the issue is predominantly one of triggering problem-solving behaviour in the absence of trainer prompts. Other major issues which still have to be satisfactorily resolved include the identification and assessment of children requiring improved social skills and social competence. In addition, there is a need to remind ourselves that while improved social skills should lead to improved judgments about an individual's social competence, the latter is a somewhat abstract notion which tells us little about an individual's goals and objectives. While improved social competence should be one of our goals, it must be anchored to well defined behavioural objectives. One can be the life and soul of a party and receive high social competence ratings, yet be lonely and isolated once the party ends.",

      "abstract": "Traditional academic learning has tended to emphasize learning as exclusively a mental process, whereas progressive approaches to learning insist that learners must be active and learn by doing. Early research on learning, dominated by behaviourism and cognitive psychology, limited itself to measurable, observable behavioural outcomes. The social nature of learning offers opportunities for the learner to reflect upon her learning not only by herself, but with others. Being able to undertake reflection alone is necessary but not sufficient. Determining who part of the learning relationship is will be important depending upon the nature of the learning task. For example, it may be inappropriate to organize development groups or learning partners where there are line relationships between members of the group. Reflective learning for transformation occurs when learners are enabled to pause and reconsider, preferably with others, the nature of what they are doing.",

This type of Balance is a product of self-regulatory processes providing productivity and satisfaction. Self-regulatory processes such as resilience are based on cognitive, emotional and behavioral strengths, and should happen adequately within time and different contexts. The concept of Balance emphasizes justice implicitly. This definition is constructed by the comparison of the ideas of different pioneer thinkers in psychology and other disciplines. There are great similarities between the definitions of positive mental health and psychological balance on the subjective and functional aspects of mental health. However, Balance perspective draws attention to a holistic perspective on mental health and can contribute to prevent social problems by emphasizing justice.",

Although children can learn positive behaviors such as coping and resilience or how to support one another, they might also learn problematic behaviors such as interpersonal violence or substance abuse. SCT describes how people can learn indirectly from their family members by seeing how their behavior is either punished or rewarded. Reinforcements are communicative reactions to a person's behavior that either work to encourage them to keep doing what they are doing, or discourage them from continuing their behavior. Self-efficacy is the confidence in the ability to successfully perform a behavior or communication act. Self-efficacy is influenced by individual factors and barriers to the success that exist in the environment.",

As a consequence, we assimilate this vast array of information at the unconscious level so it can later be considered useful during the process of identifying belief systems and behaviors for learning, decision-making, memory, language, and knowledge. These assimilations are ordered using internal strategies that can be externally observed as analog feedback behavior(s) from an individual's unconscious. These can then be concisely expressed in models for application regarding effective choices in decision-making and learning strategies, memory access, and the actualization of other understandings and applied as knowledge.

      "abstract": "Professional deformation is a widespread phenomenon among representatives of various occupational groups, especially in roles classified as “people-oriented.” The risk associated with professional deformation among probation officers in Ukraine lies in its negative impact on both job performance and personal life. Several factors contribute to the development of professional deformation in probation officers, including economic, political, social, legal, organizational, pedagogical, and psychological factors. The primary factors leading to professional deformation among probation officers include stress, moral fatigue, job dissatisfaction, psychosocial environment, repeated stressful situations, emotional suppression, personal values, overload of professional duties, lack of professional development, and exposure to traumatic events. The particularities of professional deformation among probation officers manifest in the following ways: emotional burnout, cynicism and loss of empathy, loss of faith in the system, deterioration in physical health, reduced sense of security, behavioral changes, a tendency toward isolation, increased consumption of alcohol or drugs, and a decline in work quality. This article aims to identify the specific characteristics of professional deformation among probation officers in Ukraine. It clarifies the concept of “professional deformation” and identifies its cognitive, emotional, and behavioral levels. The specifics of probation officers’ work are outlined, highlighting the extreme nature of their work with individuals under probation measures. The article identifies the causes of professional deformation in probation officers and describes the manifestations of this phenomenon. Keywords: professional deformation, probation, probation officers, emotional burnout, professional burnout, factors of professional deformation, stress.",

Methods are now being developed that can alert those facing retirement to the emotional diffi culties they may face and help them plan ways of coping with problems. Three forces in particular make the transition to retirement difficult: (1) organizations and work careers have, however inadvertently, filled a wide variety of very basic human needs, so the retiree is often unprepared to know how to replace these needs in other ways; (2) social norms and subtle pressures enhance feelings of being \"finished\"; and (3) marital difficulties result from a new twenty four-hour-a-day relationship, from unresolved conflicts, patterns of interaction, poor communication, and inadequate sharing.

      "abstract": "While some cognitive scientists regard social interactions as just another form of environmental interaction, others have proposed that social interactions place special demands on the cognitive systems involved, and may have shaped individual minds in particular ways. One consequence of the demands of action coordination between several individuals could be that in social interactions, others’ tasks are represented and integrated in one’s own action plans even when coordination is not required. To test this assumption, we investigated the performance of pairs of participants carrying out complementary and different tasks alongside each other, and compared this to performance in exactly the same tasks carried out alone. The task of another agent influenced individual performance in the group setting. Performance was also modulated by the nature of the other’s task. This suggests that individuals shared task representations and integrated each other s task in their own action planning. The results are consistent with the view that the demands of joint action have shaped mental processes, and support the claim that cognition must be studied in relation to social context.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality technology is used nowadays in various areas of science, and psychology, in particular. Successful work with virtual reality systems requires that a sense of presence emerges in the user, i.e. the subjective experience of the reality of being located in the artificially created environment and interacting with it. The lack of this experience or its insufficiency result in the interaction possibilities a virtual environment being unexploited. As a psychological phenomenon the sense of presence is caused by various psychological factors besides technological factors. In this paper, the reference literature review shows that the sense of presence is conditioned by demographic, cognitive, personality, and motivational variables. In particular, the sense of presence is dependent on differences in cognitive abilities and personal features, although in the last case the evidence is contradictory. The paper highlights a special role of cognitive control, i.e. metacognitive processes that are responsible for adjusting cognition to the context of the current task, thus emerging the sense of presence. The usage of expertise of psychological factors of the sense of presence in the development of virtual environments allowing effective user interaction is considered. The usage of psychological factors of the sense of presence as criteria for selecting users to operate in virtual environments is discussed. The directed research of various psychological factors that affect the sense of presence will not only support the development of general psychological theory of the sense of presence but also will allow to create effective solutions for fundamental and applied problems using virtual reality technology.",

Numerous social interactions—foraging, talking, trusting, coordinating, competing—can be formally represented in a game with specific rules and strategies. These same interactions seem to rely on an interweaving of mental selves, but an effective strategy need not depend on explicit strategizing and higher mental capabilities, as less sentient creatures or even lines of software can play similar games. Human players are distinct because we are less consistent and our choices respond to elements of the setting that appear to be strategically insignificant.",

      "abstract": "This paper poses a series of fundamental educational challenges about mental health. First, it questions whether 'mental health' is a valid concept, in the light of debates over mind/body dualism. If the concept is valid, should the absence of mental health be seen as an illness, an adaptive strategy or simply a statistical eccentricity? Fulford's concept of 'failure of intentional action' is commended as a philosophical basis for unravelling these issues. Secondly, the paper considers whether diagnosis is a simple or complex process, and whether it can be an objective activity or one which involves a strong subjective element. The current and potential value of multiaxial classification systems are discussed. Thirdly, themes concerning mental health treatment are introduced, covering problems with consent and patient preference, the evidential basis of interventions, and the range and limitations of possible treatments. Finally, the paper reviews the educational processes needed to meet these challenges effectively. It recommends the development of multifaceted educational programmes, nurturing a spirit of critical enquiry and personal awareness and, above all, the recognition and toleration of the uncertainty and complexity which lie at the heart of successful medical practice.",

Unlike representations, which reflect the object in a set of many different features, both significant and insignificant, the concepts carry a general, social experience, denote the essence of the object and distinguish it from all other objects. An important task of the teacher is to stimulate students' desire to acquire knowledge independently, to transform children in active participants in the educational process, to understand the essential features and connections of phenomena and objects of nature, which means to form concepts about them.&#x0D; In the process of forming a natural concept, it is impossible to do without thinking operations, which include comparison, analysis, synthesis, abstraction and generalization. At about 5 years of age, there are significant changes in the child's thinking, but purposeful pedagogical influence will significantly increase the effectiveness of this.&#x0D; In the course of the research methods, forms and techniques for the formation of natural concepts in students were selected. Verification of data formation initially took place at the ascertaining stage of the experiment and after the forming stage. Compared to the initial study, after organized work, the number of children with a high level of formation of natural concepts increased by 10 %, also the number of children with a medium level of formation increased by 7 %, and the number of low level decreased by 18 %. Thus, specially organized forms of work, selected methods and techniques help to form natural concepts in older preschool children",

There is no developed theory of its origins or functions, and different types of fatigue (mental, physical, sleepiness) are routinely confused. The widespread interpretation of fatigue as a negative consequence of work may be true only for externally imposed goals; meaningful or self-initiated work is rarely tiring and often invigorating. In the first book dedicated to the systematic treatment of fatigue for over sixty years, Robert Hockey examines its many aspects - social history, neuroscience, energetics, exercise physiology, sleep and clinical implications - and develops a new motivational control theory, in which fatigue is treated as an emotion having a fundamental adaptive role in the management of goals. He then uses this new perspective to explore the role of fatigue in relation to individual motivation, working life and well-being.",

Method: Extensive literature review was done in Google scholar, PubMed and national or institutional websites with the corresponding keywords to summarize the cases of impaired decision making and regulation of informed consent and ethical measures in those cases. Results: Decision making capacity requires three level of capacities and four levels of abilities. If a person has factual understanding, implies a certain level of rational belief, knows to manipulate information to arrive at a choice and remains stable on the choice, is known to be capacitated in decision making. Impaired decision making capacity is more common in Alzheimers disease and schizophrenia research. Although a definite line between decisional capacity and incapacity is still in question, many assessment tools are available to conclude it. Moreover, decisional incapacity has been found as a significant ratio in general or psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes regarding psychological disorders or critically ill conditions. But, these conditions should not prevent anyone from understanding, choosing, or accepting any intervention as sometimes they may have some preserved abilities too. As per accepted ethics, respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions. First, the individual should be treated as an autonomous agent and second, the person with diminished autonomy is entitled to protection. Thats why, in case of severe psychiatric diseases and Alzheimers diseases, surrogate consent is recommended. But surrogacy should be reviewed by the institutional review board (IRB). Multimedia consent process, advanced consent directives, rational consent waiver and many other processes are practiced in case of ethical research involving decisional incapacitate persons which are discussed in the paper. Conclusion: It should be clarified by the IRB whether involvement of impaired subjects has beneficial scientific aim or not. Capacity assessment system should be in an organized and systemic way. Threshold for capacity and recognition of persons able to conduct this process should be fixed. Role of surrogacy and involvement of IRB to align it in a proper manner is always a matter of concern. Consideration of risk management, subjects autonomy and assent-dissent issues should be clarified in research.",

Insecurity and doubt regarding a person�s own competence and worth flowing from painful events in the past tend to make people vulnerable. Often, spiritual wounds lead to a warped image of God; a warped self-identity as a Christian; intense pain in family relationships; overwhelming feelings of disillusionment; problems with personal borders; a lack of basic life skills; a lack of trust and purpose in life, as well as fluctuating phases of opposite emotions, like depression, anger and joy. Once denial has been overcome, counselling towards healing can start. Such counselling should primarily focus on joining a support group, spiritual healing, healing with regard to habits of thought, social recovery as well as physical healing.",

As a result, listing and comparing relative theories will help form a better understanding. Cognition is “the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses”, which has the corresponding psychological mechanism [1]. It involves many features of psychological processes such as attention, working memory, problem solving and decision making. Early psychologists took considerable time to formalize their theories regarding cognitive resources. In psychology, cognition is usually used within an information processing view of an individual’s psychological functions (Eysenck and Groome, 2015). In social cognition, the term is also used to explain attitudes, attribution, attention, and decision making. Attention is the first step of information processing in human brain, as a regulation mechanism of psychological activities, which has become a vital area of focus.",

Neuroimaging can be a valuable tool that makes it possible to: a) locate the cognitive, motor and/or perceptual processes involved in the different dual performance paradigms; b) characterise the responses and function of specific brain signals in each of the tasks, and c) relate changes in neural activity to the efficacy of different intervention programmes.Paradigmas de ejecución dual: aspectos conceptuales.Introducción. Los paradigmas de doble tarea (o tareas de ejecución dual) se hallan implicados en múltiples y variadas actividades de nuestra vida cotidiana, ya que se consideran una ventaja evolutiva de la filogenia que posibilita llevar a cabo varias tareas al mismo tiempo con una optimización ‘de los recursos neuronales’ en comparación con las tareas que, por el contrario, se realizarían como una tarea única o simple. Desarrollo. Se revisa la bibliografía relacionada con tres paradigmas de ejecución de doble tarea: a) paradigma cognitivo/motor que hace referencia a modelos, en los que se hallan implicadas una tarea con un componente cognitivo y una tarea con un componente motor; b) paradigma motor/motor que hace referencia a una tarea motora y una tarea simultánea también motora, y c) paradigma cognitivo/cognitivo, en el que se implican una tarea con un componente cognitivo y otra también cognitiva. Conclusiones. Las tareas duales son una eficiente herramienta para detectar el deterioro cognitivo leve, así como un paradigma idóneo para la intervención en rehabilitación, dado el incremento de recursos atencionales y funciones ejecutivas implicados en su ejecución. En cuanto a la neuroimagen, ésta puede aportar: a) localizar los procesos cognitivos, motores y/o perceptivos implicados en los diferentes paradigmas de ejecución dual; b) caracterizar las respuestas y función de determinadas señales cerebrales en cada una de las tareas, y c) relacionar modificaciones en la actividad neural con la eficacia de diferentes programas de intervención.",

Psychological research has shown that learners' mindsets are linked to a wide range of psychological processes (e.g., attributions, effort beliefs, goal orientations, beliefs about mistakes/failures, self-regulatory tendencies, and emotions). This chapter discusses existing evidence on mindsets in SLA, including the conceptualization and measurement of language mindsets, associations with other individual difference constructs, and the effect of mindset interventions. Although research on language mindsets has produced promising findings to help us understand learners' resilience and the development of intercultural competence, more research is needed to develop effective mindset interventions in language learning. To continue to strengthen the research on the individual differences in language mindsets, future research should continue to connect mindsets with a broader range of motivational factors and linguistic outcomes and to understand the individual characteristics that underlie language mindsets or interact with language mindsets in predicting learning outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Humans differ from other animals in the way they can skilfully and precisely operate or invent tools to facilitate their everyday life. Tools have dominated our home, travel and work environment, becoming an integral step for our motor skills development. What happens when the part of the brain responsible for tool use is damaged in our adult life due to a cerebrovascular accident? How does daily life change when we lose the previously mastered ability to make use of the objects around us? How do patients suffering from compromised tool use cope with food preparation, personal hygiene, grooming, housework, or use of home appliances? In this literature review we present a state of the art for single and multiple tool use research, with a focus on the impact that apraxia (impaired ability to perform tool-based actions) and action disorganization syndrome (ADS; impaired ability to carry out multi-step actions) have on activities of daily living (ADL). Firstly, we summarize the behavioral studies investigating the impact of apraxia and other comorbidity syndromes, such as neglect or visual extinction, on ADL. We discuss the hallmarks of the compromised tool use in terms of the sequencing of action steps, conceptual errors committed, spatial motor control, and temporal organization of the movement. In addition, we present an up-to-date overview of the neuroimaging and lesion analyses studies that provide an insight into neural correlates of tool use in the human brain and functional changes in the neural organization following a stroke, in the context of ADL. Finally we discuss the current practice in neurorehabilitation of ADL in apraxia and ADS aiming at increasing patients' independence.",

      "abstract": "Background: There is no accepted or standardized definition of 'malnutrition'. Hence, there is also no definition of what constitutes an adequate nutritional status. In elderly people, assessment of nutritional status is complex and is complicated by multi-morbidity and disabilities combined with nutrition-related problems, such as dysphagia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and muscle weakness. Objective: We propose a nutritional status model that presents nutritional status from a comprehensive functional perspective. This model visualizes the complexity of the nutritional status in elderly people. Design and results: The presented model could be interpreted as the nutritional status is conditional to a person's optimal function or situation. Another way of looking at it might be that a person's nutritional status affects his or her optimal situation. The proposed model includes four domains: (1) physical function and capacity; (2) health and somatic disorders; (3) food and nutrition; and (4) cognitive, affective, and sensory function. Each domain has a major impact on nutritional status, which in turn has a major impact on the outcome of each domain. Conclusions: Nutritional status is a multifaceted concept and there exist several knowledge gaps in the diagnosis, prevention, and optimization of treatment of inadequate nutritional status in elderly people. The nutritional status model may be useful in nutritional assessment research, as well as in the clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Individuals' actions, interactions, and reactions to events involving them are referred to as human behavior. Traditional research in understanding human behavior has been dominated by psychology and sociology. However, in the age of Artificial Intelligence, it has evolved into a multidisciplinary research domain. The goal is to bring together computer scientists, engineers, psychologists, and sociologists to develop automated tools that use computer vision, computer audition, natural language processing, and machine-learning approaches that can assess verbal and nonverbal behavioral indicators of human behavior. Given that The student behavior is representative of their progress in learning and student-teacher behavioral synchrony indicates teaching quality. Thus, the automated behavior research understanding has great potential to do tremendous good. Behavioral computing approaches may be used to recognize student actions such as hand raising, standing, sitting, note-taking, but also to infer behavioral cues such as body posture, facial expressions, head nods, and eye-gaze direction. Such actions can be used to measure the latent behavior states such as attention, concentration, and engagement. These approaches may also be used to study various teaching strategies and identify the ones which improve attention and engagement. Human behavior understanding, therefore, has a great potential to revolutionize how students and teachers engage in learning environments. It can also be used to improve teaching quality. This chapter examines the potential applications of visual sensing in classroom-based learning environments. We review current trends for data collection and data annotation to identify their limitations along with possible solutions. To complete the machine-learning pipeline, we review several domain-knowledge-based features alongside automated feature engineering and machine-learning algorithms to identify their merits and demerits. Finally, we present emerging methods from other domains of human behavior research that may also be used for classroom behavior understanding.",

      "abstract": "The focus of assessment of disease impact is moving beyond survival and biomedical outcomes to include a comprehensive set of health status and quality of life concepts. We have discussed four socially relevant concepts that can be thought of as dimensions of health status or well being: physiologic status, personal (physical) functioning, mental health, and social well-being. Quality of life was also discussed briefly as a very global concept encompassing these health status dimensions and a broader set of concepts including finances, housing, and employment. Five categories of measures based on manifest content were also discussed, including measures of disease/diagnostic status, personal functioning, mental health, general health perceptions, and social/role functioning. The physiologic dimension of health is very heterogeneous and includes many concepts and measures that vary largely independently of each other and that differ in terms of their impact on the other dimensions of health status. The physical, mental, and social dimensions of health and well-being also can be measured many different ways, and each can be broken down into distinct concepts that may vary in importance from one study to another. Of these three concepts, social well-being is the most heterogeneous. To assist investigators searching for valid measures of specific health status and quality of life concepts, we recommended formal estimations of measurement models. A preliminary model of 15 health status measures was presented to illustrate the usefulness of such a model.",

      "title": "Gradations in task engagement emerge from metacognitive priority control",
      "abstract": "Engagement is a critical motivational factor that has broad effects on learning, productivity, performance, and even satisfaction and happiness. However, engagement can be impacted by a myriad of factors including the features of the task, the broader environment and the person’s needs and biological states. Engagement has been difficult to characterize and measure, resulting in domain-specific conceptualizations and models that vary widely, creating a disconnected view of the overall phenomena of task engagement. Here we address this problem by developing an integrated metacognitive framework for understanding task engagement. We identify the key phenomenal characteristics of task engagement as integrating a graded effort for ongoing tasks with the temporal dynamics of task switching. We treat engagement as resulting from a unified meta-cognitive decision process that handles the gradient of engagement as resulting from a common priority calculation, the equivalent of an overall utility rate for ongoing tasks. Priority signals are computed relative to a set of available tasks and updated across time and changes in the environment. We propose a metacognitive controller makes decisions about both task switching (when to quit, next task) and cognitive resourcing (working memory, attention, etc) using the graded priority signals. By simultaneously choosing the task and allocating resources using the same graded signals, we capture the complex dependencies of engagement with task errors, performance, and time allocation.",

      "title": "Developmental Issues Surrounding Severe Discrepancy",
      "abstract": "This article reviews the role of development in the concept of discrepancy. Development is first defined generally and then differentiated into five types. Each type is then related to discrepancy and the notion of normal variability. The nature of individual differences is discussed in relation to the use of discrepancy for identifying other handicapping conditions. A discrepancy between ability and achievement is shown to occur within normal development and therefore is not appropriate for defining learning disabilities. It is concluded that discrepancy may be better used within learning disabilities rather than in between distinguishing learning disabilities and other handicapping conditions.",

      "title": "Mathematics And Experiential Learning Are They Compatible?",
      "abstract": "In the process of experiential learning, students acquire skills and values as the consequence of a direct experience. Experiential learning draws on senses, emotions, and cognition and appeals to learners' entire being. Such learning, by nature, enables the development of a variety of capabilities, such as planning, teamwork, coping with stressful situations, responsibility, and leadership. Experiential learning has many different definitions; it is referred to here as a \"sequence of events that include one or more specific study objects requiring active involvement of learners in various stages of the process\" (Walter &amp; Marks, 1981, p. 1). This definition perceives the process of experiential learning as an active practice in which learners leave the conventional situation of mediated learning in favor of unmediated learning through practice. Experiential learning is based mainly on the behavioral-cognitive approach, which contends that change on the cognitive level might occur amidst an experience and project onto behavioral and emotional aspects as well. In the current article, an academic project, Mathematical Debate, which is an integrative part of the strategy and process of experiential learning is presented. The strategy of experiential learning is part of the perception of planning courses guided by a learning-focused approach, which emphasizes the formulation of learning outcomes. Planning a course in a learning-focused approach helps create dialogue between the academic faculty and students and leads to compatibility between the learning outcomes (course goals) and the teaching methods and goals of evaluation.The purpose of this article is to present the need for paradigmatic change and the transition from planning a content-focused course to planning a course that is focused on learning and on the experience of learning. This article shall present a case study of a course in the \"backward design\" method, which is compatible with the learning-focused paradigm. The challenges posed by this method will be discussed as well.",

Los principales resultados arrojaron coincidencias en la orientacion hacia el logro (alcanzar la excelencia) sea dentro o fuera del ejercicio de la Psicologia; una marcada orientacion a satisfacer sus necesidades psicologicas o intrinsecas antes que las materiales o extrinsecas. Aunque muestran una marcada tendencia a “sonar” con ejercer otros oficios ademas de la psicologia, dentro del ejercicio, la Psicologia Clinica fue el objetivo laboral mas ambicionado a largo plazo, mientras que otras areas como la Psicologia Escolar u Organizacional eran vistas como “objetivos temporales” por considerar mas factible su ingreso al campo laboral a traves de ellas, por otro lado la Psicologia Comunitaria o Social era concebida como una “accion humanitaria” a desarrollar en paralelo a las otras actividades profesionales. Se evidenciaron coincidencias significativas sobre planes de emigrar y deseos de reencuentro con familiares y amigos, explicadas por el momento vital e historico-cultural que comparten los estudiantes por la situacion pais. Por ultimo, la mayoria de los estudiantes mostraron marcados intereses artisticos y deportivos desarrollados en paralelo a la profesion de psicologia.",

      "title": "Il fenomeno della resilience",
      "abstract": "The study of the effects of child mistreatment, including sexual abuse, neglect and physical abuse, suggest that the interaction between exposure to adverse experience and risk or protective factors produces a variety of phenotypic expressions; this variety includes both individuals with severe psychopathology and individuals seeming well-adapted. In substance, positive adaptation means competence with respect to behavioral, social and/or cognitive functioning (despite past or present maltreatment) and well-adapted individuals are considered resilient. This adjective is derived from resilience, term that has been improperly used as synonym of invulnerability, stress-resistance, adaptability. Reviews of literature show that resilience is currently considered a dynamic and multidimensional developmental process involving positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity. There are several variables that influence, in a positive or negative manner, the development of resilience: protective and risks factors. Investigators have identified a triad of protective factors: 1) dispositional / temperamental attributes of the child, including higher cognitive ability, positive self-esteem, internal locus of control for good events, external locus of control for abuse (or external attribution of blame), spirituality, ego-resiliency, coping strategies; 2) familial cohesion; 3) extrafamilial support. The three elements of this triad often collaborate in determining resilience, in opposition to risks factors usually coexisting in maltreatment situations (as low socio-economic level or maternal depression). In research on resilience some methodological features are more important in regard to data collection: all the sources of data, as parents', teachers' and peers' ratings, with the help of intelligence and achievement tests and grades in school, but also children’s self-reports.",

This manuscript applies recent advances in understanding decision processes to illuminate several sources of bias and error in student decisions. Decision making uses an energy resource (willpower) also involved in selfcontrol, and so when people experience depleted resources, their decisions may be less effective than usual. We review factors that contribute to depleted willpower (e.g., decision fatigue, poor diet, lack of sleep), as well as well as results of decision making in depleted state (decision avoidance and postponement, irrational bias, passive endorsement of status quo and default options, lack of integrative compromise, heeding of irrelevant criteria).",

Critical thinking involves a variety of skills such as the individual identifying the source of information, analyzing its credibility, reflecting on whether that information is consistent with their prior knowledge, and drawing conclusions based on their critical thinking. Almost all successful people can be expected to be good at their ability to think critically. The disposition toward critical thinking is considered to be crucial to a good critical thinker, as the requisite of the core cognitive skills. The critical thinker characteristics are described as a set of attitudes that define a personal disposition or tendency to use critical thinking in one's personal, professional and social life. The seven habits of mind that trigger the Critical thinking are, Truth-seeking, Open-mindedness, Analyticity, Systematicity, Self-confidence, Inquisitiveness and Cognitive maturity.",

A child is considered ‘in need’ if their health or development is actually impaired or likely to become so without some remedial intervention. Impairment refers to the absence of normal healthy development; that is, when a condition usually interferes with daily social functioning and performance. Need is linked explicitly to the existence or likelihood of harm, which in turn is connected, critically, to the ability (or inability) to act in society. It is dependent on seven points of context, which are outlined. The chapter then considers the different approaches for measuring different types of need: expressed need, comparative need, and normative need.",

      "title": "Building Models of Psychopathology Spanning Multiple Modalities of Measurement",
      "abstract": "There is currently tension in the field of psychopathology regarding recent scientific initiatives that seek to incorporate neurobiological concepts and measures into models of psychopathology, particularly with regard to significant methodological challenges facing such endeavors. In order to establish multimodal models of psychopathology that include brain and behavioral indicators along with report-based measures, a methodological strategy is needed for addressing basic psychometric issues common to lab-task measures. This chapter describes an iterative psychoneurometric research strategy to addressing such issues. This approach focuses on neurobehavioral traits – i.e., latent dispositions that manifest in brain and behavioral responses within lab tasks as well as in self-reported proclivities. The chapter provides an overview of this approach and illustrates its use in developing a multimodal model for inhibitory control capacity (inhibition-disinhibition), a neurobehavioral trait that confers liability for externalizing forms of psychopathology (substance problems, delinquency, and aggression) as well as internalizing disorders marked by pervasive and unregulated distress. It discusses how the psychoneurometric approach can be extended to other neurobehavioral traits (e.g., threat sensitivity) that operate as liabilities for psychopathology, and how multimodal models of core trait liabilities can serve as anchors for an integrative, measurement-based framework for understanding, assessing, and treating mental health problems.",

      "abstract": "Psychodynamic psychotherapies (PDP) is an umbrella term for a variety of therapeutic modalities that have evolved out of the psychoanalytic/psychodynamic tradition, each theorizing a trajectory of human development that includes an etiology of and treatment for psychopathology. PDPs have in common the belief that people have an unconscious mind that influences thoughts and behaviors outside of the individual’s awareness. These processes operate from birth till death and are responsible for adaptive and maladaptive functioning at the level of interpersonal relationships and daily living. The psychodynamic therapist creates a case formulation for the individual seeking treatment, which incorporates a formal diagnosis with an understanding of the underlying dynamic factors contributing to the individual’s suffering. From this case formulation a treatment plan is created specific to the individual. During treatment, the therapist develops a strong working alliance while utilizing psychodynamic-specific techniques targeted at bringing insight into these unconscious thoughts and behaviors. Greater self-understanding enables greater choice ability and flexibility in functioning. In contrast to prevalent views, empirical research has found support for the efficacy of PDP in the treatment of mental disorders, including but not limited to: depression, anxiety disorders, somatic disorders, and personality disorders. In general, PDP was found more effective than control conditions and not different from active treatments. PDP effects have been shown to remain stable post treatment.",

This is found in the AI ethics of “coherent extrapolated volition” and “bottom-up ethics”. This paper shows that the normative basis of AI social choice ethics is weak due to the fact that there is no one single aggregate ethical view of society. Instead, the design of social choice AI faces three sets of decisions: standing, concerning whose ethics views are included; measurement, concerning how their views are identified; and aggregation, concerning how individual views are combined to a single view that will guide AI behavior. These decisions must be made up front in the initial AI design — designers cannot “let the AI figure it out”. Each set of decisions poses difficult ethical dilemmas with major consequences for AI behavior, with some decision options yielding pathological or even catastrophic results. Furthermore, non-social choice ethics face similar issues, such as whether to count future generations or the AI itself. These issues can be more important than the question of whether or not to use social choice ethics. Attention should focus on these issues, not on social choice.",

Appropriate answers to specific ethical issues resulting from conflict or stress in the interpenetration of psychic (actions, perceptions and beliefs) and communicative schemes (decision-making sequences, interactional patterns and communicative themes) are also today’s concerns. In my paper, I propose a redefinition of second-order Ethics (after Heinz von Foerster’s Second-Order Cybernetics). Second-order Ethics proves to be a valid answer to the needs for an ethical theory able to address the theme of responsibility in personal processes where learning to learn is crucial and also a good tool to face concrete situations requiring therapeutic intervention or counselling in learning organisations.",

This feeling encompasses all of the individual's beliefs about their abilities to implement the behaviors they deem helpful to achieve the desired results. The Sense of Perceived Personal Efficacy influences the choice of activities, performance, the expenditure of effort, persistence in the face of difficulties, positive or negative thoughts, and emotional reactions. These beliefs regulate human behavior according to four processes, primarily the affective process (coping principally). The Sense of Self-Efficacy is based on four factors: lived experience, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, emotional or physiological states, and sources of information about the Sense of Self-Efficacy. This article summarizes research that revolves around the following questions: is there a link between feelings of Perceived Self-Efficacy and coping strategies; can we act on the student's motivation through his Sense of Perceived Self-Efficacy possibly modifiable by coping strategies?",

      "title": "Emotional Intelligence and Work Life Balance of Employees in the Information Technology Industry",
      "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence is a set of qualities and competencies that captures a broad collection of individual skills and dispositions, usually referred to as soft skills or inter and intra-personal skills, that are outside the traditional areas of specific knowledge, general intelligence, and technical or professional skills. Emotions are an intrinsic part of our biological makeup, and every morning they march into the office with us and influence our behaviour. Emotional intelligence consists of five factors: Knowing one’s emotions, managing emotions, motivating one, recognizing emotions in others, and handling relationships Goleman [1]. Researchers today are interested in finding the effects of emotional intelligence on employees and thereby, organizations, and analyzing the various other facets of EQ. Emotional intelligence improves individual and organizational performance. It plays a significant role in the kind of work an employee produces, and the relationship he or she enjoys in the organization. Work-Life Balance is a challenging issue for IT leaders, managers and has also attracted the attention of researchers. Work/life balance, in its broadest sense, is defined as a satisfactory level of involvement or ‘fit’ between the multiple roles in a person’s life. In this climate managing the boundary between home and work is becoming more challenging. Organizations need to ensure they not just encourage but mandate a practical and workable work/life balance policy, benefiting and meeting the needs of both the organization and its employees. Organizations not providing real opportunity for employees work/life balance are opening themselves up to increasing numbers of dissatisfied and unproductive employees and hence increased attrition rates. Merely creating a work/life policy framework is not enough; fostering an organizational culture that supports the use of available policies is also of great importance. Further there is a need for employers and employees alike to find flexible and innovative solutions that maximize productivity without damaging employee’s well-being, their family relationships and other aspects of life. This study is an attempt to contribute afresh with a new perspective to the field of human resources and behavioural sciences with special reference to emotional intelligence in relation of employees work-life balance in IT organizations. It is also an earnest attempt to bridge the gap especially in this area by highlighting the relevance and importance of work-life balance and emotional intelligence to leadership, senior management, individual and organizations and hoping this study will initiate a series of serious and productive discussion on the subject. The findings and outcome of this research will be beneficial to the IT organizations in India, which is a flourishing industry and contributes significantly to the GDP of the country and the talent pool of the world. The study will bring in sharp focus the major challenges encountered in these areas and the solutions that will aid IT organizations to deal more significantly in increasingly their effectiveness. The review on the related literature in the area of emotional intelligence and work-life balance studied in this research has provided the researcher an insight into many factors. It also provides direction in designing the present study. Having reviewed several studies and having identified the gap, the investigator felt an imperative need to undertake the present investigation. This term paper is through light on impact of emotional intelligence on performance of employees and the next objective is to know how to become an EI organization. Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. Some researchers suggest that emotional intelligence can be learned and strengthened, while other claim it is an inborn characteristic. To do the research thoroughly, review of literature is being taken with twenty articles. Through this study, it is concluded that emotional intelligence has greater impact on performance of employees. Secondly an emotionally intelligent organization is based on an organisational strategy to improve business performance.",

Variables within the referring analyst, patient, candidate, and supervisor are examined in their interaction with the circumstances of the assessment enterprise. Issues of competence, self-esteem, and oedipal rivalry, as well as guilt feelings, concerns about rejection, and other conflicts may be mobilized and may prevent a successful outcome. Clinical data from three assessment are presented and discussed. The concept of an assessment process, analogous to the psychoanalytic process, is proposed. In this process, manifestations of the patients intrapsychic life and indicators of potential transferences emerge in the context of the analysis of the patients reactions to the assessment. Potential sources of interference with the assessment process are identified, and measures to avoid them are suggested.",

      "title": "Metacognitive practice",
      "abstract": "Mindfulness as science has an uneasy relation with mindfulness as practice. Scholars seeking to define mindfulness have typically attempted to turn definitions used by meditation practitioners into scientific constructs—ideally in a manner that honors their Buddhist roots and has relevance for organizations. This produces an abundance of components like present-centered attention, non-judgment, self-acceptance, etc., that relate to each other only vaguely and point only abstractly to a common idea of mindfulness. Metacognitive practice is an alternative to this multicomponent approach. In it, the role of the scholar is not to select certain practitioner definitions as authentic, relevant, and scientific, but to instead theorize about the attempts practitioners make to define mindfulness. In fact, mindfulness may best be understood as repeated attempts to understand mindfulness. Because organizations are dynamic and complex and expertise is never complete, it is seldom clear what \"being mindful\" should look like in any specific situation. As such, attempts to understand mindfulness must always continue. People must develop metacognitive beliefs and strategies that allow them to enact mindfulness anew in each situation. Such development of metacognition is not individual: it occurs within a community of practice that furnishes supportive technologies, social interactions, terminologies, and activities.",

The deans who participated in the study had been education deans for at least 6 to 7 years, indicating that they had avoided the revolving door syndrome of 4.5 years in a single appointment. Deans described their problem solving in interviews that asked for a response to vignettes. The answers were analyzed using a conceptual model that was developed over a period of 7 years. The framework consisted of four dimensions of leadership: intellectual, emotional, social, and moral. All 14 deans used all four dimensions in responding to the vignettes yet relied on the intellectual dimension as the basis for employing the other three dimensions. Within each dimension, education deans used specific themes (e.g., defining problems) more frequently than other themes. Implications for the professional development of deans are explored.",

With the help of a within-subject design we flnd that participants’ performance in the innovation games is in fact related to their creativity, risk tolerance and self-control. Other personality traits such participants’ anxiety, independence, tough-mindedness and extraversion, if any, only play a minor role, and the same is true for participants’ analytical skills.",

      "title": "Homo Informaticus",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the concept of homo informaticus—the individual organization member framed in the IVO perspective. Homo informaticus is a cognitive microcosm that performs complex cognitive processes, engages in decision making and satisfying of informing needs, and designs and evaluates information systems (IS). Discussed are cognitive processes of thinking, feeling, perceiving, memorizing/memory recalling, and learning. These cognitive processes are involved in the fundamental informing process that starts with perception of external data, continues with applying knowledge to data, and ends with inferring information (meaning). The perspective of key cognitive processes enriches the informing model: perception is driven by previous knowledge, memory retrieval is engaged, and thinking is an overall driver, engaging both ratio and emotions. The discussion addresses cognitive limitations. Memory is limited in volume and content, perception is prone to illusions, and thinking is susceptible to biases. These limitations influence the outcomes of informing (information created) and learning (knowledge acquired). Decision making is affected as well, as indicated in its various models that reveal non-rational aspects. It is argued that homo informaticus is subject to informing (information) needs and actively seeks to satisfy them. Several models addressing this topic are examined. The chapter also covers cognitive and learning types that can be used for understanding the diversity characterizing homo informaticus. Karl Jung's typology is coupled with the dimensions of data scope, location, and processing mode. Kolb's learning styles are discussed in turn. Furthermore, the system evaluation capability of homo informaticus is demonstrated in the context of system adoption models. Finally, the system design capability is discussed in the historical context of Scandinavian experience.",

However, variation between people in the timing and degree of change experienced suggests that a range of factors determine individual cognitive ageing trajectories. This narrative review considers some of the lifestyle factors that might promote (or harm) cognitive health. The focus on lifestyle factors is because these are potentially modifiable by individuals or may be the targets of behavioural or societal interventions. To support that, the review briefly considers people's beliefs and attitudes about cognitive ageing; the nature and timing of cognitive changes across the lifespan; and the genetic contributions to cognitive ability level and change. In introducing potentially modifiable determinants, a framing that draws evidence derived from epidemiological studies of dementia is provided, before an overview of lifestyle and behavioural predictors of cognitive health, including education and occupation, diet and activity.",

      "title": "Tactics for Individual Productivity",
      "abstract": "The resolution of a difficult task often follows a series of identifiable steps. Students of creativity have often characterized the process as a four-stage phenomenon: • Preparation: Orientation to the problem and definition of the task. • Incubation: A period of aridity or immersion in unrelated activities. • Illumination: A sudden spark of insight and the recognition of a candidate solution. • Resolution: Assessment of the candidate solution and its implementation. The preparatory phase of a difficult task involves a careful consideration of the underlying problem and a clear specification of the goals. Too often we tackle tasks without an adequate definition of the true problem, and discover too late that the solution resolves an irrelevant problem. A distinguishing feature of challenging tasks lies in their resistance to attack, and solutions do not always spring from a single session of wrestling with the problem. Often difficult issues are resolved, whether gradually or suddenly, over spaced efforts interrupted by unrelated activities. Some students of creativity take the view that incubation is a period of “intermission” in which the problem submerges into the subconscious. The lack of strict conventions in this netherworld allows for the juxtaposition of new objects in novel and even bizarre combinations. The resulting ideas possess the novelty that is an essential ingredient of a creative solution. Other writers take the view that incubation is nothing more than a period of relaxation or recuperation in which a tired mind regains its energies. Still others would claim that the incubation phase is merely a stretch of time that allows the mind to assimilate other stimuli from the environment, whether at the conscious or subconscious level. Whatever the true role of incubation, the fact remains that many of our difficult problems are resolved only after several sessions of conscious effort separated by seemingly unrelated activities. A candidate solution to a difficult problem often occurs suddenly, just like the elementary ideas that constitute them. Such preliminary solutions or “insights,” however, can be misleading or even incorrect. For this reason, the ideas must be properly evaluated.",

      "title": "Grit and Successful Aging",
      "abstract": "Successful aging is a multidimensional construct that has been used by a variety of clinical and empirical disciplines to describe physical and psychological well-being among the elderly. While biomedical models of successful aging rely on fixed criteria related to health and disability status, psychological models emphasize dynamic processes that promote life satisfaction in the face of age-related declines. Psychological models have proposed individual traits that are associated with successful aging processes, including those related to coping with, adapting to, and compensating for age-related challenges (e.g., tenacious goal pursuit, flexibility, etc.). Grit is a noncognitive trait that may promote coping and compensation but has been relatively unexamined in relation to successful aging. The ability to adapt to age-related losses, such as physical disability and cognitive decline, may represent a previously unexplored facet of grit that is specific to older adults. Preserved cognitive functioning is an important component of successful aging that may be promoted by grit and the use of compensatory strategies. In the context of atypical cognitive decline, however, grit may fail to promote effective compensation and may instead result in the use of unsuccessful strategies or \"costly perseverance.\"",

At the same time, such experiences awaken a combative side of the personality, born from the need to adapt, survive and return to normal - an ability called resilience. By developing awareness and building resilience, the individual acquires a valuable resource for psycho-emotional and functional recovery.

      "title": "EXPERIENCE CONSTRUCTING AS A FACTOR OF PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT OF A PSYCHOLOGIST",
      "abstract": "The article is devoted to substantiation of influence of personal experience as an organized semantic formation on the development of a psychologist professional competence. It is shown that the problem of professional competence development should be considered in the context of a post-nonclassical methodological approach that interprets an individual as a person which is capable of self-determination, self-creation and self-designing. The experience constructing as a necessary condition for personal development is interpreted as bringing sociocultural and personal information into the system, organizing this information into related structures that help to understand its meaning. Professional competence is considered as the unity of knowledge, which is necessary for successful professional activity and experience, which involves not only the possession of necessary practical skills and abilities, but also the presence of a specialist’s developed field of professional meanings, which determine the creative nature of the psychologist’s professional activity to a large extent. The personal experience is an organized and holistic structure, the source material for which is provided by real life and professional events. It can be considered as comprehension and ordering of current events, which arise in certain life and professional situations, and, being defined, understood and interpreted, they are transformed into personal experience. The main components of professional competence are cognitive, operational and communicative. They are formed at different stages of education in the process of carrying out the following activities: educational quasi-professional and educational-professional. It is shown that the development of all professional competence types is based on understanding a students’ personal experience and to a great extent depends on the successful resolution of major conflicts – inconsistencies, desemantization and semantic conflict. Failure to resolve these conflicts blocks the development of the future specialist’s semantic sphere and leads to the person’s professional experience rigidity, uncertainty in his own professional capabilities, frustration in the future profession. It is proved that one of the conditions for resolving major conflicts is the development of the ability to understand and interpret, which are important procedures of the psychologist’s practical activities, as well as his self-knowledge, self-development and professional reflection, thus enriching his professional and personal experience. It is also shown that the development of new schemes and scenarios of professional activity with the help of two main mechanisms for understanding and interpreting personal experience – semiotic and communicative, as well as the development of dialogism as one of the professionally important qualities of a psychologist, plays an important role in the development of a psychologist’s professional competence.",

Today, self-education is a term that is rarely used. However, as can be seen in the publications of Seif (1930) and Frick (2007) it is nevertheless a term which raises some interesting questions. While Seif sees “self-awareness” as a prerequisite of self-education, Frick discusses the central role of “empowerment” and Adler’s Individual Psychology within a modern integrative perspective. In sum, a comparison between the two authors reveals differences but also some similarities: A psychodynamic understanding of the limitations caused by a person’s lifestyle and biography becomes necessary when endurance and persistence alone do not lead to personal achievement but instead to vicious circles. These negative developments can be recognized and changed with counselling, therapy or other processes of self-discovery.",

      "abstract": "In foreign language studies, many people confront various problems and puzzles, which mainly result from emotional factors apart from intellectual ones, including the lack of self-control and self-confidence. The emotional intelligence means the ability to understand, control and encourage oneself and also the ability to take care of others and establish harmonious interpersonal relations. The author believes that the emotional intelligence plays a decisive role in doing everything successfully. Therefore, we should make great efforts to cultivate students' emotional intelligence in their self-control, self-encouragement, concerning others and establishing harmonious interpersonal relations so as help students learn the foreign language well.",

      "title": "The program of empirical research of axiopsychological determinants of the act of self-determination of future psychologists",
      "abstract": "The act of self-determination of future psychologists is under­stood as a manifestation of an active personal position in choosing and defending the vector of their own life, an internal act of moral and ethical choice, and an individually significant integral psychosocial formation that progressively integrates motivational, value-based, cognitive, and activity-related components of action. It reflects the gradual and consistent formation of their personal and professional identity, encompasses their choice of future life path and professional trajectory, and requires awareness of their social role, a developed readiness for self-development, and the presence of grounds for responsible self-realization, as well as reflective comprehension of oneself as a specialist and a morally mature personality. The heuristic significance of studying the act of self-determination of future specialists is proven on the basis of comprehensive psychodiagnostics of its structural and substantive components (situational, motivational, active, and post-active), each of which represents a distinct level of their conscious engagement in acts of making life-significant decisions and indicates the presence within their professional consciousness structure of corresponding axiopsychological determinants – elements of the value-semantic sphere that regulate and direct their individual volition regarding the direction of personal and professional self-realization. The integrity of the act-based self-determination cycle is interpreted as the degree of integration of all its structural, substantive, and value-spiritual components into a holistic personality structure of a higher education applicant capable of overcoming adverse external circumstances, critically revising personal goals and meanings, making autonomous existential choices, and reflectively comprehending the consequences of decisions for their everyday life. The significance of the proposed instrumental and diagnostic support is demonstrated by stating the level of student readiness to implement their chosen professional path, determining the available resources for further personal and professional growth, identifying vectors of near-term development, and providing support in forming a holistic personality of a specialist in the socio-humanitarian field. Prospects for further research include empirical verification of the proposed psychodiagnostic program for a comprehensive empirical study of the axiopsychological determinants of the act of self-determination of future psychologists.",

      "abstract": "Freshmen are generally ill at ease with the new circumstances where they begin living and learning in an unfamiliar and inadaptable way,i.e.,the freshman syndrome.Psychologically the syndrome manifests itself from three aspects: cognition,behavior and emotion,and the reason is essentially the mental perplexity that is unable to respond well to the new circumstances because the individual freshman's cognitive structure and behavioral mode are both out-of-date.In this regard giving simply a sermon to those freshmen is ineffective at changing their original cognitive structure and behavioral mode,since both are stable naturally.The effective way to enable freshmen to adapt themselves quickly to the college life/study rests with the process to make their own experience educational,thus changing their cognition and behavior through education.They need the education of developmental psychology,including mistake trying,to be mentally mature and other cognition training to enable them to take a flexible view of the world.With respect to the behavioral training,it involves what should be well doing in learning,interpersonal relation and the thing to cope with.",

Lack of assertive behavior is related to the concept of learned helplessness. Components of assertive behavior are described with suggestions for enabling the visually impaired person to develop these skills. The underlying concepts of assertion training are explained along with specific techniques to be utilized in the school or rehabilitative setting. With a structured intervention resulting in improved assertiveness skills, blind or partially sighted individuals can increase their effectiveness in communicating with others and can feel more in control of their lives.",

AI for Learning examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can, and should, positively impact human learning, whether it be in formal or informal educational and training contexts. The notion of ‘can’ is bound up with ongoing technological developments. The notion of ‘should’ is bound up with an ethical stance that recognises the complementary capabilities of human and artificial intelligence, as well as the objectives of doing good, not doing harm, increasing justice and maintaining fairness. The book considers the different supporting roles that can help a learner – from AI as a tutor and learning aid to AI as a classroom moderator, among others – and examines both the opportunities and risks associated with each.",

      "abstract": "The ability not just to think, but to think well is, or at the very least should be, essential to fulfilled adult life. We might wish to ask, then, whether the thinking abilities of average people are sufficiently developed to make a maximum contribution to people's life fulfillment. Our ability to answer this question, it turns out, is severely limited. Human mental ability has been the subject of systematic empirical study for the past century, beginning with early psychometric investigations that provided the foundation for the theory and practice of the measurement of intelligence and culminating in the now-mature and well-respected field of modern cognitive psychology. Although much has been learned, there is still a good deal of human thinking about which we know almost nothing – thinking that might figure importantly in people's lives once they have completed formal schooling, and the particular intellectual demands it poses, and begin to channel their energies into the concerns of adult life.",
