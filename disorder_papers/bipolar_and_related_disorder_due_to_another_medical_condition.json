      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

In the great majority of these instances, however, the external conditions represent only an additional, precipitating aetiological factor which is operating as a trigger mechanism to a mental derangement of non-specific character already present in a latent state. It may therefore be of some theoretical and practical interest to report on a group of acute and subacute psychotic states whose history, features, course and outcome characterize them as constituting a readily recognizable clinical entity of purely psychological, situational origin.",

There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

Hysteria and anxiety neurosis often can be managed as successfully by an internist or general practitioner as by a psychiatrist. Depression more often justifies a psychiatric referral. \"Functional\" symptoms which cannot be attributed to one of these syndromes often warrant further search for an organic cause.",

This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

Headaches or neuralgias from other causes may offer abundant difficulties in differential diagnosis to members of this special group or to other physicians, especially if a careful history, family and personal, is not given precedence over physical findings and roentgen evidence. To limit the field of discussion, I choose to consider under \"other causes\" only those headaches or neuralgias, with associated symptoms, which appear periodically for months or years or most of a lifetime in the ambulatory or ordinary office patient. Such patients usually carry on most of their regular duties and enjoy good health except for short periods of marked discomfort. Real pathologic changes in the face or head, or",

Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw.

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte.

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders.

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Sintomi Psichici e Somatici dei Disturbi dell'Umore: razionali di terapia",
      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

At present, psychotherapeutic treatment is an essential part along with the pharmacological one and can be carried out intermittently during the menstrual period.This article aims to report some factors suffered by women with PMDD within their work performance, which must generate emotional, physical, and social strategies so that each menstrual cycle can cope with the various consequences of this condition. The findings made it possible to identify complications in women in physical conditions such as extreme pain, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, decrease in blood pressure, decrease or loss of appetite, sleep disorders, lack of libido, and fatigue, among others. Moreover, on an emotional level, it can present irritability, crying, social withdrawal, guilt and worthlessness, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or intention, stress, or Burnout Syndrome.",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management.

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS).

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

It is often difficult for clinician to make correct diagnosis in presence of various disorders. The clinical picture of various disorders interferes with treatment process and the outcome. There are some disorders in psychiatry, known as chronic illness. These are schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. All these three disorder have a major effect on individual's life. Anxiety, depression, substance abuse and panic symptoms are common in schizophrenia; hence the clinical picture changes frequently. While the literature suggests that presence of two or three disorders make treatment worse, hence multidisciplinary treatment need to be used.",

      "title": "KNOWING DEPRESSION AND PHARMACOLOGICAL, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR ITS TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Approach of Fibromyalgia",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "title": "Burnout and its impact on Nurses and Doctors",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "title": "Depression associated with stroke",
      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation.

But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

Some of these problems are the result of the apparent nature and complexity of the symptoms presented by the psychiatric patient. However, other problems reflect philosophical positions ranging from those based on the premise that primary depression does not fit the medical model and therefore is not a \"disease\" that can be modeled, to those holding that the emotional state of depression is so uniquely human that subhuman organisms cannot be used in its analysis. In evaluating animal models of any human disorder or condition, it is crucial for those using the models to keep abreast of developments and advances in the relevant clinical knowledge concerning the particular condition being studied. This is especially important for such disorders as essential hypertension or major depression where the central causative factors are not yet known, but where extensive clinical investigation is constantly expanding knowledge of the patients' condition.",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants. The patient complains of feeling antsy or being agitated or unable to sleep when taking traditional antidepressants. Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness.

During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

The condition may seem to be part of the individual's character. There may be a convincing alternative explanation. The illness may cause the individual to be unappealing, leading the clinician to withdraw. The physical disorder may render the patient unable to communicate effectively. The patient may exhibit few, if any, physical signs or symptoms, especially at the outset. The disorder may be disguised by an atypical presentation. The only clue may be the absence of something that should be there.",

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome.

      "abstract": "Introduction The National Institute of Mental Health describe the main symptoms of bipolar disorder as alternating episodes of high and low mood. Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

      "title": "SPL12 HEAVY PHYSICAL WORK AND FATIGUE IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure.

      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

Their inattentive, hyperactive, impulsive, irritable, oppositional, antisocial, callous, psychopathic, narcissistic, and histrionic behaviors and their abuse of, and dependence on, psychoactive substances interfere with functioning in school, work, and other settings; alienate peers and family members; and can lead to serious social consequences such as family conflict, being fired from employment, or incarceration.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda .

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it.

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

      "title": "Psychodiagnostics as a mandatory element of patient protocols in dentistry",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The psycho-emotional status of patients requiring dental treatment is severely affected by constant stress.[1] Stress is associated with visible or perceived defects that disrupt the patient's image: difficulties in articulating words during chewing or communicating with other people. The severity of such a stressful condition depends on several factors. Among these are the type of nervous activity, characteristics of the patient's perception of their image, social environment and social reaction to the patient's appearance, patient's assessment of their own condition, and the dentist's attitude toward the patient's psycho-emotional state.[2] Many unsuccessful dental interventions occur primarily due to the negative emotional mood of patients; however, they also deal with the discomfort that they experience both during and after the dental procedure. That is exacerbated by increasing stress, anxiety, and psycho-emotional tension or exhaustion, diminishing the positive effect of dental treatment.[3] Further, numerous research works observed possible changes in the normal functioning of the patient's body, namely, in pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate values.[456] These are visible in the results of studies when the ECG was performed during dental surgery.[7] Such deviations might also have the opposite effect. Thus, psycho-emotional stress leads to a delay in the grafting process. Changes in the nervous and endocrine systems can cause certain disturbances in the hemostatic system.[8] High emotional tension is also known to cause a specific contraction of the skeletal musculature of the face, which results in a manifestation of a local vascular response.[9] Another psycho-emotional trait that characterizes patients with dental problems is the anticipation of pain far before the start of the surgery. Some particularly sensitive patients can experience serious emotional trauma, even during simple dental procedures such as dental extraction. Fear can occur at the anesthesia stage, and the patient's body is then characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, which exceeds energy production. Psycho-emotional stress results in a 17% increase in oxygen consumption on average, triggering anaerobic glycolysis. This process, in turn, is a precursor to acidosis, leading to tissue hypoxia and a delayed reparation process. Increased anxiety is the cause of maladaptation and the appearance of neuropsychic disorders, as well as a slower recovery rate after surgery.[10] Psychodiagnosis is, thus, a necessary element of dental treatment. The use of dental questionnaires contributes to the selection of appropriate tactics for interaction between the physician and the patient. In this case, the questionnaires both before and after patients' dental treatment appear necessary. Comparing the results of the pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire provides good insights into the effectiveness of dental treatment. As there are relatively few studies of this type to date, it appears necessary and relevant to conduct them. In order to adequately assess patient satisfaction with the quality of dental care provided, specialized questionnaires may be helpful, in addition to traditional methods of psycho-emotional analysis.[11] They contain dental questions that are relevant to both the dentist and the patient.[12] Once these questionnaires have been analyzed, the right tactics for patient rehabilitation can be selected.[13] A logical construction of such an analysis is the study of changes in the values of indicators of the patient's psychological state both before and after dental intervention.[14] Such an analysis is a reliable measure of the effectiveness and quality of dental care provided.[1516] Further, these studies appear necessary as they may contribute to the improvement of dental service quality. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis of the psycho-emotional condition of patients both before and after dental surgery. The objectives of the study were: (a) to examine the psycho-emotional state of patients with removable constructions; (b) similarly, to examine the state of patients with fixed constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS The study was conducted in the Russian Federation in 2019–2020; it addressed data on patients from three dental clinics (two clinics from the Moscow city [Dental Clinic No. 62 of the Moscow City Health Department and Dental Clinic No. 12 of the Moscow City Health Department] and one clinic from the Perm city [City Dental Clinic No. 1]). The study involved a total of 600 patients divided into three groups. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 63 years, with a mean age of 42.0 ± 5.5 years. The average age and the number of men and women in each group are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Gender composition and average age of patients in the three groupsThe number of men and women in each group was similar (P ≥ 0.05; Table 1). The age of patients within each group and between groups also had no significant differences. The first group consisted of 200 patients with fixed dentures (metal-ceramic, used up to 3 years); the second group included patients with removable devices (200 patients); and the control group comprised 200 patients with healthy teeth. The dental procedures were provided under local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN The Fere method was applied to estimate the predominant activity of the hemispheres. A scheme included three components: a current source and its amplifier (15 mAm) + silver electrodes (S = 2 cm2) + ohmmeter. Parameters of this skin-galvanic reaction were taken from two fingers of the right and left hands. Parameters on different hands were measured separately, first on the left hand and then on the right hand. Low resistance values at the moment of data acquisition allowed concluding the right hemisphere dominance in the patient's mental and emotional spheres and the corresponding emotional manifestations, namely, aggression, negative emotions, and increased anxiety. On the left side, the same data indicated the dominance of the left hemisphere with the corresponding emotions—satisfaction and positive emotions. Afterward, a bilateral asymmetry of hemispheric activity was calculated, when the left-hand indicators were divided by the right-hand indicators. The index value equaling to one was considered to be a physiological norm. Thus, the activity of the hemispheres was balanced. This study was conducted following international ethical and moral standards (the Helsinki Declaration of 1975). When working with patients, their written consent to data processing was obtained. Anonymity and confidentiality of information were preserved. RESEARCH METHODS Levels of anxiety and pain were determined by using a questionnaire. For this purpose, a generally accepted scale of patients' self-assessment of anxiety by Spielberger and Hanin and a Universal Pain Assessment Tool were applied. This test adequately reflects personal and reactive anxiety, estimating it as a constant characteristic of a personality. The advantage of the test is its validity and informativeness in the self-assessment of anxiety levels. The test includes two blocks corresponding to the level of reactive (questions 1 to 20) and personal (questions 21 to 40) anxiety. Reactive anxiety was calculated following the formula P = (A1 − A2) + 50, where A1 is the sum of 3–4, 6–7, 9, 12–14, and 18 items of the anxiety level scale, and A2 is the sum of items 1–2, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 19–20. Similarly, the level of personal anxiety was calculated using the formula L = (A1 − A2) + 35, in which A1 corresponds to the sum of items from questions 22 to 25 inclusive, questions 28 and 29, 31 and 32, also questions 34 and 35, questions 37 to 39 inclusive, and A2 is the sum of items from the remaining questions. Pain level was interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10 or by monitoring the patient's behavior. Each patient also filled out a questionnaire designed to express their opinion about the quality of dental treatment received. The questionnaire included questions on the patient's assessment of their teeth condition and their opinion on how the treatment affected their health and various aspects of life. The list of questions also included social aspects of the patient's life and, from the patient's point of view, the necessity and obligation of visiting the dentist. RESEARCH ALGORITHM The study was performed in the following way. First, a testing of Fere's skin-galvanic reaction was performed. Then, each of the patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire developed by the authors. Pain assessment was performed during the dental procedure under local anesthesia. Afterward, the skin-galvanic reaction readings were taken again, and the Spielberger-Hanin Scale questionnaire was administered. The Anxiety Scale questionnaire was offered once since in case of repeated completion, the patient may deliberately change the answers following his/her momentum opinion that the wrong answer was chosen at the beginning. The aim was to capture the possible relationship between questions about dental health and changes in anxiety levels. The algorithm allows establishing a clear psychodiagnostic of the patient's psychic state after the dental procedure, in particular, to reveal any changes in anxiety scores after the received therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data were processed using Statistica v. 6.0. A two-sample t-test for independent samples was used to detect the significance of differences. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The distribution of features corresponded to normal, allowing for the establishment of Pearson's correlations. Tables 1–3 show arithmetic mean values for each parameter and the error of the mean.Table 2: Psychodiagnostics results of patients with healthy teeth (control group) before and after the survey about the condition of teethTable 3: Characteristics of psycho-emotional condition in patients from Group 1 (fixed metal-ceramic dentures) before and after evaluation of dental statusRESULTS For the control group, the asymmetry hemispheric activity index in 81 patients was within unity, which corresponded to a state of equilibrium. For another 69 patients, this index was less than unity, which corresponded to positive mood and the dominance of the left hemisphere. Finally, in 60 patients, the coefficient exceeded unity, which corresponded to dominance of the right hemisphere and negative emotional mood [Table 2]. In the control group, significant differences were established only for female patients. In both groups, with equilibrium and negative hemispheric activity index, the differences between the values before and after treatment were significant toward a 1.1-fold increase [Table 2]. The other indicators, particularly in the male group, did not differ from those in the control one. A direct correlation was established between the score in the dental status questionnaire and the emotions with which the patient filled out the questionnaire. This correlation was more pronounced in women (0.72; P ≤ 0.05) compared with men, namely, 0.72 vs. 0.57 at P ≤ 0.05, respectively. Consequently, the emotional state of the patients can influence the answers in the dental status questionnaire. There was also a direct correlation between the score growth in the questionnaire and the values of the hemispheric activity index after the survey, namely, 0.75 (P ≤ 0.05) for women and 0.64 (P ≤ 0.05) for men. Thus, the questions of the survey itself can have a significant influence on the patients' emotional state. At the same time, no statistically significant correlation between anxiety scores and the results of the dental status questionnaire were recorded for the control group. For patients from the second group with removable dentures, the hemispheric activity index corresponded to unity in 83 patients, that is, was equilibrium; in 48 patients, it was less than unity, that is, the left hemisphere and positive emotions dominated; and in the remaining 69 patients, the index exceeded unity, that is, the right hemisphere and negative emotions dominated. However, after a survey about dental health, the following changes were observed: 55 patients reported a state of equilibrium, 37 patients had positive emotional disposition, and the remaining 108 had a negative empathy. Significant changes were also obtained for the hemispheric activity index after the dental status survey, namely a 1.3-fold in men with the positive emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), a 2.2-fold in women with the negative emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), and a 2.1-fold in men from the same group (P ≤ 0.01). Also, a direct correlation between the increase of patients' questionnaire scores and their emotional state was recorded: 0.70 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.79 for men (P ≤ 0.05). These results indicate the influence of the patient's emotional state on the questionnaire results. After the survey, however, this relationship intensified in Group 2, and the correlation between the scores and hemispheric activity factor was 0.88 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.91 for men (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the control group, there was also a correlation between the anxiety level and score growth rates. Thus, for personal anxiety in men, the Pearson's correlation was 0.84 for both genders (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the reactive anxiety index amounted to 0.78 for women and 0.81 for men (P ≤ 0.05). The increasing level of anxiety indicates a negative influence of responses about dental treatment, which is also illustrated by the increasing number of patients with a negative emotional empathy in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 had a similar emotional state distribution compared with Group 2 before completing the dental status questionnaire. Thus, 87 had an equilibrium status with index values around unity, 68 were positive, and 43 were negative [Table 3]. After the patients answered the questions about dental health, the ratio of subgroups with different emotional moods changed in favor of the negative one. Hence, there were 80 people in an equilibrium state, 63 were positively inclined, and 57 had a negative emotional disposition [Table 3]. This indicates a tendency for the negative emotional mood to increase after the survey on dental status. Significant changes in the hemispheric activity coefficient both before and after treatment were noted for men with positive mood (a 1.1-fold increase, P ≤ 0.01), for women with negative mood (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05), and for men from the same group (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05). There was a direct correlation between the increased scores and emotional disposition among men and women in Group 1, namely 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Also, a correlation was established between the value of the hemispheric activity factor and the increased scores after the survey was recorded, namely, 0.82 for men and 0.81 for women (P ≤ 0.05). A correlation between an increase in the scores and the values of personal anxiety for men and women was 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). For reactive anxiety, these indices were 0.56 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). As a result, patients in Groups 1 and 2 with removable and fixed dentures differ in anxiety levels. This confirms the hypothesis that the results of the dental health survey generally have a negative impact on the psycho-emotional status of the patient, especially when the local type of anesthesia is used. DISCUSSION This study showed that after the survey on dental status and quality of life was conducted, a significant increase in the hemispheric activity index values was noted among patients in the groups with removable and fixed dentures demonstrated. Hence, the emotional state of the patients changed toward the negative in both groups in general. These changes affected most patients with negative emotional mood prior to the administration of the questionnaire. There was also a dependence on the type of dentures. In Group 2 (with removable dentures), the increase in negative emotions was more pronounced, with the indices of anxiety varying more in male patients. Thus, the survey results can be used to perform a psychodiagnostic of the patient's emotional condition. If the patient scored up to 18 points on the survey, it can be stated that he or she is satisfied with the dental treatment provided. When the number of points ranges from 18.0 to 29.0, the patient can be considered as only partially satisfied with the quality of dental care provided. If a patient scores more than 29 points based on the test results, it can be assumed that they are not satisfied with the dental treatment performed. The behavioral response of patients under local anesthesia in the first group suggested a moderate level of pain. According to the results on the hemispheric activity index, the indicators of negative emotional mood worsened 1.2 times (P ≤ 0.05) for men and women in the group with fixed dentures; however, in the group with removable dentures, this tendency was stronger with 2.2 and 2.1 times, accordingly (P ≤ 0.01). These results are supported by the increased level of anxiety in patients with removable and fixed dentures. No emotional changes were found in any of the controls. The significance of differences between the groups according to the survey results was confirmed by statistical tests and established correlations between the emotional mood and the increase in scores. Among the study limitations, the factor of gender belonging (significant differences obtained for men and women) and the state of the patient's psyche should be particularly considered. In cases where the patient's mental condition may deviate from generally accepted norms (i.e., phobias), the test results may not adequately correspond to the patient's real psycho-emotional state. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the stress level of patients with epilepsy during dental procedures.[17] Data from questionnaires administered to 85 patients with epilepsy before elective dental surgery were considered. Dental anxiety was found in 17.6% of patients (n = 15). At the same time, dental anxiety did not correspond to factors such as age, level of education, type of epilepsy, frequency of attacks, use of antiepileptics, and many others. However, a significant correlation was found between gender (P < 0.01) and the type of oral surgery (removal of a retained third molar; P < 0.05) on the one hand and the level of dental anxiety on the other. Similar results were reported in other studies.[1819] A relationship to the gender factor was also established in this study. Results from this study are generally consistent with similar research. Thus, using data on 105 patients (aged 18–23 years) of dental clinics, it was found that different groups demonstrated various anxiety levels expressed in dentophobia and salivary pH changes.[20] Group 1 demonstrated a low level of anxiety and consisted of 33 patients (31.4%). Group 2 included 32 patients (30.5%) with moderate anxiety levels; however, in Group 2 with 40 patients (38.1%), a high anxiety level was recorded.[20] Of the 105 study participants, 85% showed low levels of dentophobia, 27% demonstrated low levels of anxiety, 29% showed moderate anxiety levels, and 28% showed high levels of anxiety. The mean salivary pH of all participants was 6.79 at rest and 6.43 in anxiety.[20] Thus, saliva pH may also be a factor worth considering in such studies. Another study showed that microcirculatory changes can indicate psycho-emotional stress development.[21] The study included 30 patients. The control group consisted of patients without psycho-emotional disorders but with postprosthetic complications after dental implantation. The results obtained showed that the capillary blood flow during stress changes at both oscillatory and nonoscillatory levels. At vasodilatation, an intensification of blood flow and disruption of venous flow was established. Analysis of high- and low-frequency oscillations by wavelet transformations revealed an increase in endothelium activity and a decrease in sympathetic adrenergic vasomotor and precapillary tone. Psycho-emotional stress is, therefore, mostly caused by a physiological factor. The patient's consciousness in dental clinic is a comprehensive relationship with the stimuli received from external and internal receptors. Through the interaction of these receptors, the consciousness forms a kind of emotional background, reflecting the patient's perception of the physical condition.[22232425] Besides, all of the patient's perceptions or experiences about their condition are reflected in the way they relate to their health.[26] In general, such patients can be divided into three groups: with a dismissive attitude, with an adequate attitude, and finally, the group with increased attention to their health.[16] Other data indicate that a negative emotional background is influenced by factors, such as the patient's intelligence, the intensity of pain, and the severity of the ongoing disease or upcoming dental procedure.[2728] Thus, research into the patient's emotional activity type plays an important role in subsequent dental treatment. The predominance of negative emotions, such as irritability, demandingness, and the frustration of their physical sensations, constitute a significant proportion among character traits, which also affect the patient's social life.[29] It is known that among the patients who have agreed to treatment, feelings of fear and pain may increase even before the dental treatment starts. Fear may take different, and often opposing, forms, such as worry, euphoria, and anxiety. Of the techniques used, two approaches are dominant.[22] The first approach is clinical, consisting of analytical conversations with the patient and observing behavioral patterns. The second approach is a laboratory one, which is less costly in time and resources and implies the use of questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaires are the Eysenck questionnaire, the MMPI, and the MMPI 2. Further, the Eysenck questionnaire links types of temperament, extraversion and introversion, as well as stability and instability. However, most of the questionnaires show different deficiencies. Some of them diagnose a small number of psychoypes, others are too cumbersome, and many do not include psychometric properties. CONCLUSION This study showed that changes in the hemispheric activity index and indicators of personal and reactive anxiety are related to the survey results on the dental status and the type of dental service provided. By the quality-of-life criteria, the values obtained were different according to the emotional mood of the patient. It follows that obtaining reliable information about the patient's satisfaction with the dental care provided, questionnaires on the patient's dental health status are required in addition to the standard psychodiagnostic techniques. The study and analysis of the data obtained allow for the right choice to restore the patient's physical and mental health after receiving dental care. Such a multicomponent approach can greatly enhance the quality of dental treatments and establish the most efficient methods. These results are confirmed by the heightened level of anxiety in patients in groups with removable and fixed prostheses. No change of emotional mood was noted in controls.

Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

One can then observe co-occurrence and mutual interaction of dysfunctions typical of addiction and of other mental disorders that accompany addiction. That is why, clinical pictures of such states (double diagnosis) are usually less unique, have an unusual course and cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The problem of forensic psychiatric opinion and treatment of people with a double diagnosis is another aspect of these difficulties. It is caused by the fact that forensic psychiatric assessment of the mental state of such people requires taking into consideration a very complex clinical and legal situation triggered by the interference of various ethiopathogenetic and clinical disorders. It leads to the need for complex evaluation and reference to sanity or other signs of functioning within the current law should result, first of all, from the analyses directly pertaining to the influence of the diagnosed disorders on the state of patients with double diagnosis. The forensic psychiatric aspect of disorders connected with double diagnosis is particularly significant as there is a relatively high risk of behaviours posing a threat to public order in this group of patients.",

This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents.

Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory.

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages.

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

      "abstract": "In the course of medical practice we are confronted from time to time by peculiar seizures or nerve storms, which lack conformity with the more familiar descriptions. Some of these seizures cause great alarm to their victims, in that they seem to threaten paralysis, speechlessness, unconsciousness, or even death itself, or because they occasion profound states of instability and prostration. The appearance and sufferings of the patients during these attacks may further alarm relatives or onlookers, and even the medical man, unless he be familiar with the true nature of the seizures or fully alive to the history of the case, may be taken unawares, and feel so dubious about their purport and outcome as to be unable to give a reassuring prognosis. And yet the seizures which I have in mind are all consistent with long life and with good health at other times. Those with the more local effects may simulate or suggest organic disease of the brain ; those causing serious instability may also be wrongly attributed to cerebral vascular disease or cerebral tumour ; those which cause",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious.

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

In particular in younger children, an uncomfortable situation, a psychological problem or an emotional distress is rarely expressed directly but usually through physical symptoms.

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients.

      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief.

The pathogenesis is multifactorial but is probably often due to changes in the autonomic nervous system, as well as to age-related changes in the cardiovascular and endocrine systems. In addition, the presence of multiple diseases and medications are common contributing factors. Standardized measurement of postural blood pressure and recording of heart rate and assessment of associated symptoms are essential for the clinical diagnosis. Evaluation and management depend on an initial thorough clinical review of problems. Usually elimination of offending medications and treatment of contributing medical disorders are adequate. Occasionally, use of volume expanders and newer experimental agents is indicated. Postural hypotension can be seen as a prototypical clinical disorder of the elderly. It reflects impaired homeostasis; its etiology is multifactorial and due to the effects of both age and disease; it is clinically protean; and it can result in falls, injury, and progressive decline if not recognized and treated early.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Esta afeccion se presenta frecuentemente en todas las personas del mundo y mas, si estos se encuentran laborando y/o estudiando, si el estres se presenta en exceso o no se puede revertir, se pueden generar distintas enfermedades como: hipertension y diabetes, las cuales presentan sintomatologias como: aumento de la presion sanguinea, gastritis, problemas del sueno, agotamiento, alteraciones de apetito, tension y dolor muscular, dolores de cabeza, alta temperatura corporal, pesadillas, ansiedad, fobias e irritabilidad, ademas, no solo se generan alteraciones a la salud, sino tambien en el rendimiento academico y laboral causando ausencia e incapacidad para cumplir con sus deberes, hasta incluso se pudiese llegar a la muerte. En la presente investigacion se determinaron las diferentes variantes que pueden llegar a ser alteradas por el estres academico y laboral. Los datos se obtuvieron midiendo los parametros fisiologicos de frecuencia cardiaca, presion arterial y glucosa serica utilizando los equipos necesarios para ello, ademas, se aplicaron diferentes encuestas como el PSS-14 e Inventario SISCO, los resultados recabados se verificaron estadisticamente con las pruebas de Ryan-Joiner y Kruskal-Wallis aplicando un nivel de confianza del 95%, concluyendo estadisticamente que el estres fisiologico no puede ser danino o mortal cuando se liga directamente con el estres academico y laboral.",

      "abstract": "Summary Overtraining, a decrease in performance despite training that does not disappear after 2 weeks of relative rest, accompanied by symptoms like fatigue, anorexia, and muscle and joint pain, mood changes and feeling burnt out or stale is a frequent syndrome in endurance athletes. It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity.

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

Stress factors in elderly have their particularity. Anxiety states in elderly can develop in response to factors that wouldn’t cause mental disorders in a young persons. The most common chronic factors in elderly are lonely dwelling, change of life conditions and financial losses, diminished capacity of self-serving, helplessness and living in dependence of other people because of somatic diseases. Among acute stress factors could be mentioned on interrupted association with relatives, moving to a new place, had planned hospitalization and surgical treatment. Clinical picture of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder in elderly has its particularity. It is characterized by impairment of emotional and will functions expressed in depressive mood, fear, anxiety assessment of future. These factors lead to forming pathological motivation of behavior, accompanied by feeling of helplessness, uncertainty in abilities. Cognitive functions are also disturbed, especially in case of comorbide organic emotionally labile disorder of vascular genesis. In such cases symptoms of both disorders enforce each other. Firstly, attentive functions are disturbed because of fixation on unreal problems, connected with anxiety apprehensions. Voluntary memory is also reduced, especially on recent events. Although mixed anxiety and depressive disorder has a mild level of severity, it is accompanied with disturbance of critical functions. It has a great influence on persons’ capacity to make decisions and on level of social functioning.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

      "abstract": "Hypochondriacal delusions are not bound to a specific mental disorder, but occur in the whole spectrum of psychoses. In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are thought to be one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses in children/adolescents. Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder, and the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders among youths with chronic medical illnesses is higher compared to their healthy counterparts. Anxiety disorders may develop secondary to predisposing biological mechanisms related to a child's specific medical illness, as a response to being ill or in the hospital, a threatening environment, as a result of other genetic and psychological factors, or as a combination of all these factors. Additionally, exposure to physical pain early in one's life and/or frequent painful medical procedures are correlated with fear and anxiety during subsequent procedures and treatments, and may lead to medical nonadherence and other comorbidities. Anxiety disorders can have serious consequences in children/adolescents with chronic and/or life-limiting medical illnesses. Therefore, proper identification and treatment of anxiety disorders is necessary and may improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also physical symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive methods as well as psychotropic medications are used to treat anxiety disorders in pediatric patients. We will review current treatments for anxiety in children/adolescents with medical illnesses and propose future research directions.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a rare condition, however its consequences might be devastating, since it affects patients’ physical function as well as psychological well-being. Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex disorder that is commonly associated with brain dysfunction, social isolation, and vocational difficulty. Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric illness in epilepsy, but emerging evidence is providing a more complete and clearer elucidation of the problem. Clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with quality of life than does the seizure rate. In fact, depression is second only to medication toxicity as the clinical factor that explains the greatest variance in quality of life. Only a small number of studies have investigated the plausible neurobiological mechanisms of depression in epilepsy, but preliminary data suggest that underlying brain dysfunction may be a more important predictor than vocational or social disability. Furthermore, specific aspects of hippocampal dysfunction may be a causal factor in the genesis and maintenance of depression in temporal lobe epilepsy. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management are expected to become available in the near future.",

Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Depression in the Diabetic Patient",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Their proximity is an indicator of the closeness of the classification of the two disorders. Dissociation is often part of the response to trauma. Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

Symptoms of depression can be manifestations of either dementing or medical illnesses, both of which are common in the elderly. Psychosocial factors that are unique to the elderly may be etiologic in the genesis of depressive symptoms, but nevertheless require the clinician to fully assess each patient and treat as appropriate. Accurate treatment mandates a detailed history, often with collaboration with the family, and a thorough medical evaluation for other comorbid illnesses that may contribute to the patient's current presentation. The treatment of depressive symptoms in the elderly requires an understanding of both the origin of these symptoms and the proper treatment of the underlying disorder whether it is due to medical, dementing, psycho-social or melancholic factors.",

      "abstract": "Insight is a multidimensional construct, defined as the awareness of having a mental disorder, of specific symptoms and their attribution to the disorder, the awareness of social consequences, and of need for treatment. Although insight has been studied specifically in schizophrenia and its study in mood disorders has traditionally received limited attention, the evaluation of this concept in mood disorders is also very important because of the impact on treatment compliance and outcome. In bipolar disorder (BD), clinical insight varies substantially over time. Most researchers observed that insight is more impaired during an illness episode than during remission, in mixed than in pure manic episodes, in bipolar II than in bipolar I patients, and in pure mania than in bipolar or unipolar depression. Lack of insight is a consistent factor of non-adherence to medication in bipolar patients, along with severity of BD, side effects of medication, effectiveness, and patient-related factors. Also, impaired insight into treatment and a great number of previous hospitalizations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes (psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, violent or suicidal behavior) among the patients with bipolar I disorder. In the management of bipolar disorder, improving quality of life (QoL) and outcome should be one the most important goals.",

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas.

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

      "title": "[Current psychological findings in essential hypertension].",
      "abstract": "Many authors have investigated the role of psychic factors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypertension. Experimental studies have confirmed that the emotional stress induces a longterm blood pressure increase. Psychophysiologic investigations have revealed that patients with essential hypertension, when compared to the healthy population, are characterized by prompt reactions at the very initial stage of the disease, accompanied by an elevation of the biochemical and vegetative functional parameters, blood pressure in particular. It is in concordance with findings that hypertonics have hemodynamic reactions at rest quite similar to those found in normotonics under the emotional stress. Certain psychosocial factors cannot be identified as absolute causes of the disease. Their particular role varies from person to person. It depends on particular personality features whether any of these factors will be experienced as a stress. It has therefore been assumed that hypertension is a concomitant vegetative phenomenon, typical for people who have a permanent feeling of anger or for ambitious people who are under a permanent pressure of striving for success. Numerous psychological investigations have led to a conclusion that hypertonics have psychological troubles which cannot generally be considered as specific for hypertension. The question concerning the part played by such behaviour as the primary cause of the disease is still to be answered. Doubtlessly, such behaviour is frequent in hypertonics and it probably contributes to persistence of the disease, since they are more apt to stressogenic situations. These findings have resulted in formulating the therapeutic strategies with psychophysiologic orientation. At the physiological level, they resolve the increased excitement and lower the excessive reactivity of the vegetative nervous system, whereas on the psychological level, applying psychotherapy methods, they achieve both cognitive and behavioural changes.",

Stress caused by a working environment is known as occupational stress and globally considered to be among the topmost serious health issues. Stress and burnout have reached all-time highs across various professions as stressors have become assiduous and indeterminate - employers and employees alike are scrambling to return to normalcy in the working environment. Burnout results from the physical, mental, and psychological reactions from experiencing prolonged stress. Burnout, considered an occupational phenomenon rather than a medical condition, is often exacerbated with depression and anxiety leading to concerns of employee well-being and mental health. The progressive escalation of occupational stress and burnout has gained attention from global organizations and as the nature of work continues to evolve, understanding occupational stress can support initiatives for managing it.",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma refers to a sudden intense surge of anxiety secondary to some external event that exceeds the subject’s ability to cope with and to defend against. However, the term “trauma” is actually difficult to define due to its subjective nature. The American Psychiatric Association defines it as an event or events that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others. Examples of such events include military combat, violent personal attack, natural or humanmade disasters, and torture. For children, sexually traumatic events may include ageinappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury (American Psychiatric Association. and American Psychiatric Association.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses.

      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3.

These include at leasttwo of the following six symptoms: muscle aches, drowsiness,headaches, sleep disturbances, inability to relax, andirritability. Factors affecting employee health and well-beingcan have a significant impact on the financial costs associatedwith employee health and the profitability of the business.Action needs to be taken at an individual and organisationallevel to reduce the levels of stress and burnout syndrome.",

It can be challenging for clinicians to differentiate PBA from mood disorders, contributing to its high rate of misdiagnosis.

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

It is a common knowledge that comorbid anxiety and depression disorders can influence the course of various somatic illnesses and worsen their prognosis. We also have evidence-based studies that depression for example is an independent risk factor of heart infarct onset. On the other hand, we observe the somatization of clinical picture of mental disorders, the increase of atypical forms manifesting through pain or other somatic syndromes that leads to the increase of mental illnesses in the primary care. The research of common pathways of mental and somatic pathology should be the subject of further interdisciplinary research programs. The other issue is the patient's compliance that plays in important role in the success of every kind of treatment. Personality traits and status of mental health can influence ones attitude to illness as well as motivation to therapy. We cannot assess the population state of health without taking into consideration the evaluation of mental status as well as such definitions like subjective well being, life quality and stigmatization.

A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse.

Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide.

This stigmatization is sometimes internalized by the patients, leading to self-stigmatization. Specific features and impacts of stigmatization and self-stigmatization in patients with bipolar illness are the subjects of this review.Studies were identified through PUBMED, Web of Science and Scopus databases as well as existing reviews. The search terms included \"bipolar disorder\", \"stigma\", \"self-stigma\" psychoeducation\", \"psychotherapy\", \"psychosocial treatment\". Key articles listed in reference lists were searched.Considerable recent evidence indicates that bipolar patients and their families are stigmatized, and that this stigmatization affects their quality of life as well as social functioning. The severity of stigmatization in bipolar disorder is greater than that in people with depression. There is also evidence of self-stigmatization which further decreases the quality of life. Stigmatization and self-stigmatization were shown to be one of the barriers that delay or prevent effective treatment, and thus exert adverse effects on the outcomes of bipolar disorder.Stigma affects the experience of illness as well as social functioning in patients with bipolar disorder. The impact of stigma on the lives and treatment outcomes of patients with bipolar disorder mandates intensive effort of mental health research and policy to address this problem. Much has been done against the stigmatization of the mentally ill. But the fight against stigma remains a fundamental objective of health programs for mental health.",

Indeed, many patients with this affliction wander from one physician to another either vainly undergoing increasingly complex diagnostic procedures or being dismissed as anxious or neurotic.

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the causes of a decline in the socioprofessional functioning and for decreased quality of life. Depression is often accompanied by other medical conditions. It is not known to what extent these medical conditions precede or lead to depression. The present study proposes to identify somatic comorbities in a group of patients with major depressive disorder. The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk. Early and effective treatment leads to a lower mortality rate.",

      "title": "Treatment options for situational anxiety in the neurology physician practice",
      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

The findings suggest that burnout can take place among representatives of older age and more it is continued, provided professional activities. The cessation of the work activities leads to stress, often with the subsequent development post-traumatic stress disorder and stress-induced diseases. However in this case the clinical symptoms of the syndrome of emotional burnout, does not disappear, but only happens their clinical transformation attach various psychosomatic disorders. Thus, the elderly, suffering the syndrome of emotional burnout, are at high risk group with regard to the formation and development of diseases, associated with stress and require close monitoring in the framework of the compulsory program of medical examination.В статье представлены результаты сравнительного исследования клинических проявлений синдрома эмоционального выгорания у 84 работающих по специальности врачей-терапевтов женщин пожилого возраста и 48 официально прекративших работу по данной специальности. Полученные данные указывают на то, что синдром эмоционального выгорания может иметь место у лиц пожилого возраста, и он более всего связан с продолжающейся профессиональной деятельностью. Прекращение данной трудовой деятельности приводит к стрессу, нередко с последующим развитием посттравматического стрессового расстройства и стресс-индуцированных заболеваний. При этом клинические проявления самого синдрома эмоционального выгорания не исчезают, а лишь трансформируются с присоединением различных психосоматических нарушений. Таким образом, пожилые, страдающие синдромом эмоционального выгорания, являются группой риска в отношении формирования и развития заболеваний, связанных со стрессом, и нуждаются в пристальном наблюдении в рамках обязательной программы диспансеризации.",

In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage.

      "title": "Stress exposure, perceived stress severity, and their effects on health",
      "abstract": "While stress is one of the central concepts in many contemporary theories of health, there is no universal definition of stress or stressors. Stress is usually understood as a subjective experience of tension, pressure, distress, fear or negative emotions that occurs as a result of a perceived threat to one’s mental or physical well-being and is accompanied by an evolved biological response that facilitates adaptive reaction. While stress is conceptualized as a taxing condition, it is not understood as uniformly harmful per se. In fact, stress response is often cited as an adaptive reaction. Moreover, not every incident of stress exposure results in a disease or has an undermining effect on health. Mere exposure to stress does not warrant the healthy organism’s falling ill. Yet stress has been shown to affect health both directly and indirectly, having impact on multiple chronic conditions. Stressors vary in their severity and their ability to leave their mark on health, and it is therefore important to develop reliable methods of measuring stress to better understand how stress affects health and instigates pathology. One of the difficulties of measuring the effects of stress is connected to the distinction between external stressors and their internal appraisal. More recently, stress researchers began to make a distinction between stress exposure (i.e., facing an objectively measurable stressor) and perceived stress severity (i.e., a subjective experience of stress resulting from individual’s facing a stressor). The latter has been shown to have a superior predictive ability in terms of negative health outcomes (both breadth and depth of observed effects) compared to the former. Measurement-wise, subjective stress also tends to yield more precise results, which makes it preferable as a stress-assessment tool. The present article is a literature review study that delves into this distinction and attempts to shed light onto its implications for measuring stress and its effects on health.",

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much.

These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper delineates mental load and stress as two related concepts that originate from different theoretical frameworks. A proper distinction between the two concepts is important, not only for theory building, but because it may lead also to different interpretations of experimental results, and, consequently, to different recommendations in applied situations. High workload is regarded as an important but not a critical factor in the development of stress symptoms. It is quite possible to work hard in difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavourable conditions, without cognitive strain, psychosomatic complaints, or adverse physiological effects. High task demands can be met by mobilizing extra energy through mental effort. This 'trying harder' reaction is a normal and healthy coping strategy to adapt to situational demands. In contrast, stress is regarded as a state in which the equilibrium between cognitive and energetical processes is disturbed by ineffective energy, mobilization and negative emotions. Stress typically is characterized by inefficient behaviour, overreactivity, and the incapacity to recover from work. Stress is regarded as a state in which the physiological system is disorganized, which results in decreased well-being, sleeping problems, psychosomatic complaints, and increased health risks.

There is increasing research evidence, however, showing the differences between MDD and BD in multiple aspects, such as clinical characteristics and pathogenesis. Here, we summarized the research progress on the heterogeneity of BD and MDD by reviewing Chinese and English literature published in recent years. The main content includes the differences between the both disorders in clinical manifestations, psychological characteristics, genetic factors, neuropathology, and neurochemical metabolism.

      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic, and disabling illness that adversely impacts the child's psychosocial development including family, social, and academic functioning. Prevalence of bipolar disorder is about 1% in adolescents. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and younger adolescents is a challenge, as symptoms may differ from those typically observed in late adolescence and adulthood. One main area of debate centers around the core mood symptom of pediatric mania. The presence of classic cardinal symptoms of euphoria and/or grandiosity characterized by distinctive developmental expressions is emphasized by one view, while another view stresses the distinctly assaultive and persistent irritability of pediatric mania. The non-episodic, continuous, rapid cycling pattern and the high rate of mixed mania pose additional diagnostic challenge, as clinicians may not be able to rely on the typical presence of mood swings to make the diagnosis. Frequent occurrence of comorbid disorders exhibiting symptom overlap with pediatric mania, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may further complicate the diagnosis. Appreciation of current evidence combined with exercise of good clinical judgment may help clinicians optimally diagnose a substantial number of psychiatrically referred youths who present with a complex and severe symptomatology suggestive of bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

In its milder or more circumscribed forms, it causes people to avoid activities such as speaking or eating in public that are an important part of social functioning. In its more severe and generalized forms, it imposes crippling restrictions that result in social isolation and loneliness. It is perhaps the most prevalent and disabling of the anxiety disorders yet is responsive to treatment. Still, few persons seek this treatment, viewing their problem as a form of shyness or inherent weakness to be endured. Added to this, mental health professionals have, until recently, been slow to diagnose and treat the condition.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

It is the manifestation of one or more physical symptoms accompanied by excessive thoughts, emotion, and/or behavior related to the symptom, which causes significant distress and/or dysfunction. These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions. These revisions were intended to increase the relevance of SSD and its use in the primary care setting.",

These distressing symptoms affect not only the individuals directly experiencing them, but also those who care for them, both personally and professionally. The importance of altered mental status is yet further magnified by its prevalence, as one of the most common reasons to receive acute medical care. The term altered mental status, however, represents an especially complex constellation of symptoms, a label applied by clinicians that simultaneously consolidates and oversimplifies different patient concerns and clinical syndromes that can be due to disparate causes within and outside of the nervous system.[1] This complexity can provoke nearly as much confusion in clinicians as patients themselves.",

It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which start shortly before or at the onset of menses and which could last for 3 days. In particular, PD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of young females and is the main reason behind their absenteeism from school or work. It is suggested that increased intrauterine secretion of prostaglandins F2α and E2 are responsible for the pelvic pain associated with this disorder. Its associated symptoms are physical and/or psychological. Its physical symptoms include headache, lethargy, sleep disturbances, tender breasts, various body pains, disturbed appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and increased urination, whereas its psychological symptoms include mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability. While its diagnosis is based on patients' history, symptoms, and physical examination, its treatment aims to improve the QOL through the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and/or the use of non-pharmacological aids (e.g., topical heat application and exercise). Patients must be monitored to measure their response to treatment, assess their adherence, observe potential side effects, and perform further investigations, if needed.",

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

      "title": "Central Poststroke Pain: An Abstruse Outcome",
      "abstract": "Central poststroke pain (CPSP), formerly known as thalamic pain syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy, is a central neuropathic pain occurring in patients affected by stroke. It is one manifestation of central pain, which is broadly defined as central neuropathic pain caused by lesions or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Thalamic pain was first described 100 years ago by Déjerine and Roussy and has been described as \"among the most spectacular, distressing, and intractable of pain syndromes\". CPSP is characterized by constant or intermittent pain and is associated with sensory abnormalities, particularly of thermal sensation. While the pain is frequently described as burning, scalding, or burning and freezing, other symptoms are usually vague and hard to characterize, making an early diagnosis particularly difficult. In fact, those who develop CPSP may no longer be under the care of health care professionals when their symptoms begin to manifest, resulting in misdiagnosis or a significant delay before treatment begins. Diagnosis is further complicated by cognitive and speech limitations that may occur following stroke, as well as by depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Patients may also exhibit spontaneous dysesthesia and the stimulus-evoked sensory disturbances of dysesthesia, allodynia and hyperalgesia. The present study offers a historical reference point for future clinical and basic research into this elusive type of debilitating pain.",

      "abstract": "Children and adolescents may express psychiatric symptoms via somatic complaints. Likewise, children with chronic somatic illnesses are likely to experience psychiatric sequelae. We report three cases of adolescents who were admitted to general paediatrics services for abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting with a negative medical workup. In each case, a clear psychosocial stressor was evident. It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter. More research is needed to determine appropriate screening tools for identifying cases where psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in symptom presentation, as well as potential treatment modalities for such cases.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships.

      "abstract": "Factitious disorder is defined by the intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological symptoms with the objective of assuming the patient role. It is frequently difficult to adequately diagnose this disorder, above all, when the faked symptoms are those of a psychological or a psychiatric disorder. In these cases, there is often high comorbidity with other mental disorders, thus making it difficult to differentiate between real and factitious symptoms. Moreover, the lack of clear objective markers makes assessing the diagnosis even more difficult. In this article, we have aimed to clarify how a correct diagnosis of factitious disorder with psychological symptoms can be reached, to observe the different therapeutic strategies described in the literature and to analyze the utility of each one of them in a given case report.",

      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

To the emotional unrest caused by these vestiges of ancient taboos may be added disturbances of the female reproductive organs that are caused by other emotional conflicts. In psychosomatic illness, the patient is a victim of some emotional conflict of which she is unaware. Her symptoms are real, but the causes are elusive. Because she is disturbed, she consults a physician in an effort to discover an organic basis for her symptoms. Menstrual disturbances; vague, low, abdominal pain; intramenstrual cramping; headache, nausea, vomiting; palpitation, loose stools, and urinary frequency may be associated with emotional conflicts. Marital problems may be the causative factor, or may intensify gynecological conditions. Sexual maladjustment may cause a woman to be frigid or to have dyspareunia. Menstrual disturbances may be the only manifestation of her unhappiness. Some physicians believe that emotional conflicts may play an important part in sterility. A patient who consults her physician because of symptoms for which no physical basis may be found needs as much sympathy and understanding as does the patient with demonstrable physical pathology. Her pains and aches, troubles and miseries, discontents and disappointments are very real to her; she must not simply be classed as neurotic, ignored when she lists her complaints, or rushed through her examination and consultation with the physician. The nurse's understanding will be of great comfort to this patient and perhaps will even be a factor in helping her get well.",

      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

      "abstract": "The approach to a patient who is confused demands the same principles of assessment that would be applied to other situations in neurology or medicine. The doctor requires knowledge, skill, and most of all experience, but can improve the chances of a correct diagnosis and appropriate management by careful history taking, examination, and observation. This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium. The same patient can have both or neither subtype.\n\nDelirium tremens is a specific term for the confusional state caused by withdrawal of alcohol.\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of delirium depend on the population studied. Prevalence in hospital ranges from 10–20% in medical wards and could become higher as the elderly population in hospital increases. The incidence during hospitalisation ranges from 4–30%, again depending on the population studied. About 25% of people over 70 years old admitted to hospital have delirium.\n\nThe history and examination should be directed to look at …",

      "abstract": "Background: Psychological stress is a reaction to an unexpected situation that favours adaptation and response to the event. However, when psychological stress is chronic or very intense, it can induce changes in various systems and tissues, causing diseases or aggravating existing ones. Objective: To briefly analyse the pathophysiological conditions caused by psychological stress. Method: A narrative review of the scientific literature on pathophysiological conditions as a consequence of psychological stress was performed. Results: Psychological stress can induce various conditions at the gastrointestinal, immune and cardiovascular levels. This is mainly due to the neurobiological and endocrine response because when faced with a stressful stimulus, a deregulated release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines is generated, altering the normal physiology of the organism. Gastrointestinal disorders are mainly due to goblet cell dysfunction, resulting in intestinal hyperpermeability, inflammation and infection. Changes at the immune level lead to an increase in inflammatory responses but a decrease in the protective activities of the immune system. Finally, cardiovascular conditions include atherosclerosis, increased blood pressure and stroke. Conclusion: Psychological stress can induce real physiological pathologies and, in some cases, fatal ones. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies have already been studied and identified. Knowledge of these molecular mechanisms can help clinicians and therapists to improve the treatment and therapy of patients.",

The classical characteristics of psychosis are impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delusions, and illusions. While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully.

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disturbances represent a common and uniquely challenging consequence of stroke. These disorders arise at the intersection of lesion-related brain dysfunction and psychological distress related to the event and its aftermath, making it difficult to identify what symptom is a direct physiological consequence of the stroke. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment. Further research is needed to understand and tailor treatment of these disorders in the poststroke population.",

      "abstract": "This chapter deals mainly with common acute and chronic neurological problems, particularly as they affect employees and job applicants. The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "title": "Quality of Life of Older Adults with Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is now recognized as an important patient outcome in response to a disease, treatment, or procedure. The term health-related quality of life (HRQL) refers to a multidimensional construct involving the individual's evaluation or judgment about subjective well-being and objective attributes of functioning. Although there are varying definitions of HRQL, a group of international experts agreed that the fundamental dimensions of HRQL are physical, mental/psychological, and social health, as well as global perceptions of function and well-being.1 Other dimensions of HRQL might also be important, depending on the purpose of an investigation and the specific health condition being studied. These dimensions include cognitive or neuropsychologic functioning, sexual functioning and intimacy, personal productivity, symptoms, pain, energy/vitality, sleep, and self-esteem. Urinary incontinence and its associated symptoms can have a significant impact on the HRQL of older adults. Evidence suggests that incontinence can affect HRQL in diverse and far-reaching ways and that there is considerable variability among individuals in their perceptions and responses to urinary symptoms.2 In addition, there are differences in HRQL impairment, depending on the type of incontinence, the age, and possibly the gender of the patient.2 Surprisingly, research has not consistently documented a strong relationship between incontinence severity (typically measured in the number of incontinent episodes or grams of fluid lost on a pad test) and HRQL impact. The explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between these two types of patient outcome measures is unclear. In this issue are two reports that examine aspects of the HRQL of community-dwelling older adults with urinary incontinence. The reports approach the topic from different perspectives and research methodologies, yet each report makes an important contribution that furthers our understanding related to the impact of incontinence on one or more domains of quality of life. Catherine DuBeau and her colleagues3 present descriptions of the impact of urge incontinence in the lives of older women and men obtained through qualitative research methodologies. The ultimate goal of their work is to develop a HRQL instrument that has strong validity for use in urge incontinent older patients. These authors compared patient-defined areas of impact obtained through focus group interviews with provider/expert areas of impact obtained from the literature and included in published condition-specific quality of life instruments. DuBeau et al. also examined the patients'descriptions to identify the possible role of patients'explanatory style as a mediator of the impact of incontinence on HRQL. DuBeau et al.'s study represents the second generation of instrument development work in research on the HRQL of incontinent patients. She and her colleagues are to be commended for their sound approach to the development of a new condition-specific HRQL instrument. Because HRQL is, by definition, the patient's own perspectives on his/her functioning and well-being, the use of focus group and content analysis methodologies is appropriate. As a next step in establishing content validity, the authors could either take the items identified in the focus groups back to the participants or take them to a new group of older adults with urge incontinence for further validation. Another critical step, one which is usually skipped in HRQL instrument development, would be to have the participants evaluate the importance of each of the specified items in relation to the other items. This would help identify whether each item should be weighted equally or given a different value in calculating subscale scores. See also p 683 and p 693 One limitation in DuBeau et al.'s study was the use of a nonrepresentative sample, i.e., the sample was all white and predominantly of high socioeconomic status. Cultural and economic differences could affect perceptions of the impact of incontinence in participants'lives. Despite this limitation, the results from this study emphasize the differences between the way experts and patients view HRQL and provide new information on the impact of urge incontinence on older adults. More than half of the items identified by DuBeau and her colleagues were not described previously, which may be related to the different conceptual orientations of researchers about what constitutes HRQL versus what factors influence it. For example, DuBeau and her colleagues include a domain on coping. In some theoretical perspectives, this might be considered a personal trait that is not a characteristic of HRQL, whereas in others it might be viewed as a mediating variable of HRQL.4 Also, specific items identified — such as the inevitability of incontinence, that incontinence is a psychological not a physical problem, the association of incontinence with women's biology, and fear of aging — reflect an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs rather than HRQL. A significant finding in this study was the greater influence of urge incontinence on coping with embarrassment and the interruption of activities compared with the performance of activities, which is used typically in geriatric assessment models. A novel aspect of DuBeau et al.'s study was the examination of explanatory style, i.e., the habitual manner in which persons explain how and why uncontrollable adverse events such as illness occur to them, as a possible mediator of HRQL. Previous research suggests that explanatory style correlates with the range of responses of individuals to illnesses. It makes sense that explanatory style affects responses to incontinence. The authors'findings indicate an association between negative explanatory statements and HRQL items and suggest that there may be gender differences. However, the results on gender differences must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of men in the sample. No consistent relationship was found between incontinence severity, as measured by the number of incontinent episodes on a voiding diary, and explanatory style. Theodore Johnson II and his colleagues5 conducted a secondary analysis from data collected in the 1990–1991 National Survey of Self Care and Aging to assess whether urinary incontinence and its severity were associated with the self-rating of poor health. The National Survey of Self-Care and Aging is a random sampling of geographic clusters of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the contiguous United States. This study had a sample size of 3485, with oversampling of the oldest-old age group and men to enable subgroup analyses. Findings from Johnson et al.'s study confirm earlier research about the relationship between incontinence and health perceptions. This is an important milestone. Urinary incontinence was associated with poor self-rated health for white subjects who had no instrumental activities of daily living impairments even after controlling for age, activity of daily living status, and comorbid health conditions. The odds of rating one's health poor were doubled if the incontinence was mild to moderate and quadrupled if the incontinence was severe. Previous research examining the relationship between incontinence and self-rated health status has been criticized because of the failure to account adequately for frailty. Johnson et al.'s study did control carefully for functional status and comorbidity and found that urinary incontinence is associated with poor self-rated health independent of frailty. Although analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, this study has two main limitations. First, it was a post hoc comparison dependent on cross-sectional data collected in a larger study for a different purpose. Thus, as the authors pointed out, conclusions about causality are problematic. Prospective studies are needed. Second, the quantitative nature of the study, with fixed choice responses to a survey instrument, does not allow for the breadth of responses that might come from in-depth interviews of incontinent individuals, allowing better understanding of why they rated their health as poor. Was it because of the incontinence and its associated symptoms or consequences, or are there other unexplained factors that might have been missed? Future research should address the frame of reference used by incontinent adults in their self-ratings of health. Krause and Jay6 found that global ratings of health are interpreted in different ways by different people and that these ways may depend on race and, possibly, education. Understanding why persons rate health in a particular way may be helpful in determining appropriate interventions. Additional studies on the HRQL of incontinent older adults are greatly needed. There is much that we still need to learn about how age, gender, and lower urinary tract pathophysiology alter the impact of incontinence on HRQL, as well as the factors that influence HRQL. However, these studies should be based on a clear conceptualization of HRQL in which the determinants of quality of life are distinguished from the dimensions of quality of life. Wilson and Cleary7 have presented a useful model that helps categorize clinical variables and shows their relationships with measures of HRQL. In their model, various patient outcomes are linked with causal pathways to show how intervening variables mediate the effect on HRQL. Their model includes five levels of patient outcomes: biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and quality of life. Characteristics of the individual (e.g., personality, motivation, values, preferences, and symptom amplification) and of the environment (e.g., psychological, social, and economic supports) influence the five levels in complex ways. In addition, nonmedical factors may directly influence an individual's rating of overall quality of life. Translating their model to incontinence research, the biological and physiological factors might include the underlying pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract, urodynamic variables, and pelvic support and pelvic muscle strength characteristics. Symptoms are the patient's perception of abnormal physical, emotional, or cognitive states and are influenced by demographic and cultural factors. Examples of these include lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Functioning refers to the individual's ability to carry out his/her normal activities. General health perceptions would be the individual's self-rating of health status. Overall quality of life would be the individual's life satisfaction as a whole. In conclusion, the qualitative study by DuBeau and her colleagues and the survey analysis by Johnson and his associates complement each other, enriching our understanding of the way incontinence is interpreted and processed by patients. Further depth and refinement in our understanding of the impact of incontinence can lead to more focused and more effective interventions that will improve the HRQL of the millions of Americans who suffer from incontinence.",

Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

      "abstract": "Essential hypertension is a heterogenous disease made up of several still unspecified subgroups. According to the dual theory of hypertension, acquired and genetic factors can lead to vascular muscle defects and increased sympathetic drive, which, either both or each alone, can lead to an increased vascular resistance. Acquired factors can either help a predisposition to become a manifest disease, act by itself to cause a disease or prevent a genetic trait from becoming manifest. Among the acquired factors, we differentiate those lying inside the personality, which means they are early acquired in life and those lying outside of the individual such as job-stress, noise exposure etc. How the external stressors are perceived depends upon the personality make up and the social support system. Within the presented model the Greek word 'crisis' plays an important role, since it characterizes a state in which a decision has to be made. In a situation in which a decision cannot be made in reality or tried out in fantasy life, the organism will activate the autonomic nervous system in a planless fashion, alternating very rapidly between its two branches, with concomitant symptoms of trembling, piloerection, salivation, vomiting, urination, defecation etc. In case this persists for a longer period of time the reciprocity between the two systems may break down, the organism seems to be psychologically immobilized. In the beginning of stress exposure, increased sympathetic nervous system activity is seen as an adaptive response, thereby enabling the individual to cope, but if the attempts to cope meet with constant failure, the stress becomes unbearable. The attitude of giving up which then develops is accompanied by a low level functioning of the sympathetic nervous system. This goes along with an adaptation for the baroreceptor depressor mechanism. As a consequence, any kind of additional stress would not lead to a relieving counterregulation. This might be a small stone within the mosaic of essential hypertension.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid leakage in a patient with depression: pre-existing depression may complicate the clinical picture of this complex syndrome",
      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

      "title": "Depresija u starijoj životnoj dobi",
      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a major disorder of mood characterized by a persistent dysphoria, anxiety, irritability, fear, brooding, appetite and sleep disturbances, weight loss, psychomotor agitation or retardation, decreased energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty in concentrating or thinking, possible delusions and hallucinations, and thoughts of death or suicide.The disorder, which occurs in children, adolescents, and adults, may develop over a period of days, weeks, or months.We call it the four step viscous cycle of Incidence, Prevalence, Mortality and Lifetime risk.The reasons could be many specifically categorizing them into environmental, psychological and genetic causes.Episodes may occur in clusters or singly, separated by several years of normality.The causes of the disorder are multiple and complex and may involve biological, psychological, interpersonal, and sociocultural factors that lead to an unidentifiable intra psychic conflict.Treatment includes use of antidepressants like FETZIMA and electroconvulsive therapy, followed by long-term psychotherapy.Nursing care is needed to ensure adequate nutrition, appropriate balance of fluid intake and output, good personal hygiene, and protection of the patient from self-injury.It is also called major affective disorder or unipolar disorder.Genetically triggered determinants leading to Major Depressive Disorders include diseases like Dysthymia, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, etc. Environmental changes play a major role in bringing psychological changes in a person thereby leading to various kinds of changes in their attitude which might take the shape of Major Depressive Disorder.All of these various environmental, psychological and genetic factors which give rise to depression shall be further discussed in the paper.",

Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

Based on the discrepancy, the somatic symptoms with medically unexplained origins maintains, prolonged chronically, and grow up to FSS owing to various factors; physiological pathways, mood disturbance such as anxiety or depression, doctor-patient relationship, psychosocial stresses, alexithymia and alexisomia, and lack of support systems. As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses. FSS should be treated from aspects of both the similarity and the difference.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

Occupational stress is accepted as a multifaceted condition that does not arise from one specific hazard or displays one specific symptom.

Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre.

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "title": "Management of Hypertension Complicated by Psychiatric Comorbidity",
      "abstract": "Diverse psychosocial forces can impact hypertension and its clinical care. Chronic mental stress is possibly a cause of essential hypertension. Opinions on this are polarized, no doubt partly because the occupational health litigation dimensions of the subject are so divisive. White coat hypertension has psychologic roots that remain enigmatic; introversion and shyness have been implicated. The apparent blood pressure (BP) surges of labile hypertension can be real, artifactual, or illusory; psychologic factors are operative in some instances via panic attacks and episodic life stress. Panic disorder not uncommonly coexists with hypertension, confounding the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and influencing antihypertensive drug choices; panic attacks can masquerade as hypertensive emergencies. Obsessive compulsive disorder can transform home BP measurement into a compulsive, ritualized component of the illness. Depressive illness and schizophrenia may coexist with hypertension through prescribed psychotropic drugs causing weight gain and BP elevation. Attitudinal barriers to treatment, beyond explicit psychopathology, do exist; antidrug ideology, psychologic denial, and indifference to life itself are examples. In nearly 40 years of medical practice involving primarily the care of patients with high BP in Canberra, Australia; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Melbourne, Australia, it has been impressed on one of the authors (ME) that some patients are extraordinarily difficult to help. These are the patients who make the heart sink when their names are seen on the patient list for the day, because of past and ongoing therapeutic failure with them. This failure is usually not a result of them having the most severe hypertension. More often than not, it results from the presence of psychiatric illness coexisting with their hypertension or a personality that impinges adversely, in various ways, on the doctor-patient therapeutic alliance. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity are common in hypertension clinics. This can result from medical referral biases, with somatic symptoms or morbid health preoccupations in depression and anxiety disorders leading to the initial medical presentation and subsequent referral. In addition, the prevalence of some psychiatric illness is genuinely increased in patients with essential hypertension; an example is panic disorder.1 Further, some drugs used in psychiatric care can cause hypertension secondary to weight gain. In this commentary, we try to formulate the common psychosocial reasons for therapeutic failure with hypertensive patients and describe some of the characteristics of everyone's \"difficult\" patient. This could only be possible with the input of both the clinical experience of the hypertensionologist (ME) and the psychiatric expertise of his wife (RS), who tried to make sense of his uncomprehending and psychiatrically naive complaints at the end of the working day. Together, we have prepared this commentary in the hope that in the future, treatment of the problem patient might be a little less daunting. The prevalence of panic disorder is increased in patients with essential hypertension. This represents a special case of a broader phenomenon, the high level of anxiety disorder, often undiagnosed, in medical practice in general.2 With panic disorder and hypertension, there is almost certainly a true increase in comorbidity,1 but medical referral and attendance biases also contribute to the apparent link. Further, some antihypertensive drugs seem capable of initiating panic disorder. α-Adrenergic drugs that cause recurring postural hypotension accompanied by dizziness, palpitations, and sweating are a case in point. The mechanism appears to be analogous to that operating when recurrent cardiac arrhythmias, particularly supraventricular tachycardia, cause panic disorder by sensitizing the patient to cardiac symptoms.3 The presence of panic disorder can confound hypertension diagnoses. A panic attack accompanied by marked BP increase can lead to a misdiagnosis of hypertension sufficiently severe to constitute a medical emergency. Differentiating panic disorder from pheochromocytoma can be difficult, which is explicitly acknowledged in the use of the term pseudopheochromocytoma applied in patients in whom anxiety disorder masquerades as an adrenal medullary tumor.4,5 Similar symptoms can occur with both, accompanied by BP surges. Twenty-four-hour urinary catecholamine excretion can be misleading; urinary adrenaline excretion can be elevated 2- to 3-fold in patients with panic disorder if the collection period includes a panic attack. The invariable sense of dread at the very onset of panic attack, not typical of a pheochromocytoma episode, is a helpful discriminator. Hypertensive patients with anxiety disorder can generate worrying symptoms by hyperventilating, which often leads to unnecessary medical investigations.6 Persons experiencing panic can also misinterpret their symptoms as drug side effects. These \"side effects\" are to be curtailed by the doctor or in a short order all antihypertensives in the pharmacopeia will be tried, but discontinued, on spurious grounds. Panic disorder usually responds well to selective serotonin reuptake-blocking drugs and to cognitive behavior therapy, alone or in combination. β-Adrenergic-blocking drugs are a useful addition, helpful in treating both the panic disorder and the hypertension. In some patients, BP is materially higher at the time of medical consultation than when self-recorded in the home or measured with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring; this is the so-called white coat effect.7 Despite these forms of BP measurement being regarded as the gold standard, the error occasionally can be in the home BP record, such as in the patient who takes multiple measurements, searching for their \"best\" (lowest) BP level, which might perhaps be found after a hot shower and duly recorded. Not surprisingly, the clinic BP in persons such as these will be higher. Much more usual is active elevation of BP at the time of the medical consultation. The precise origins of the white coat effect remain uncertain. It is sometimes attributed to a stereotyped, conditioned anxiety response, but this is unlikely because if it is true, extinction of the response would be expected with the flooding exposure of repeated clinic visits and BP measurements. The white coat effect usually persists across multiple visits,7 often for many years. Our personal experience is that the white coat effect seems to be prominent in shy and rather self-conscious patients for whom the uncomfortable intimacy of the consultation is the trigger for the BP elevation (and not uncommonly, blushing). There is systematic support for this idea in a Japanese study8 in which researchers found that white coat reactors scored low on the Eysenck extroversion scale (ie, they had high introversion). Eysenck argued that the highly introverted, in particular, find social interactions aversive. Further support comes from a study in Italian patients9 that reported that the white coat phenomenon was highly correlated with an increase in BP during public speaking, a stereotypic challenge to the introverted. Patients with white coat hypertension do not have greater BP response across the board to stressors in general. Does this formulation provide a strategy for overcoming the measurement artifact that white coat hypertension entails? Not really; training the patient in BP self-recording remains the preferred option. BP is very fluid in its responses to the internal environment and to life events. White coat hypertension has its origins in this phenomenon. In some patients, the day-to-day variability of BP seems to be greater than usual (as distinct from white coat hypertension, which is a constant in the clinic7). This is used as a diagnostic discriminator, in their being categorized as labile hypertensives. To some, family physicians and medical generalists in particular, this diagnostic designation ranks in importance with some other recognized hypertension subclasses, such as essential, secondary, and malignant hypertension. Hypertension specialists are less accepting of the existence of labile hypertension as a discrete entity. Some deny its existence.10 Others would suggest that although excess BP lability can be illusory, or artifactual, it is sometimes real and diagnostically important (Table I). In some patients, such as those with panic disorder or episodic life stresses, labile hypertension is real enough and psychogenic. In people with severe, recurring life stresses, BP can be the \"barometer\" of their level of distress. Others may perhaps have inexplicable surges of sympathetic nervous system activity sometimes categorized as autonomic epilepsy: a murky, poorly understood characteristic of a few patients with essential hypertension. In some patients, such as those with borderline BP elevation, lability of hypertension is illusory.10 BP recorded in the clinic, while actually showing the usual degree of variability, creates an illusion of greater fluctuation than normal by oscillating around the cutoff for the diagnosis of established hypertension.10 In other patients, high BP lability is artifactual, a consequence of the auscultatory gap phenomenon in which there is a premature disappearance of sounds with subsequent return as the cuff is further deflated. Labile hypertension diagnosed from hospital charts is notoriously of this form. Some careful interns and residents, in avoiding the auscultatory gap artifact by estimating the BP by pulse as a preliminary measure, have recorded the BP accurately, while those who are less careful have missed the true systolic pressure and recorded the lower BP when the disappearing auscultatory sounds reappear. The labile hypertension not to be missed is that accompanying pheochromocytoma. Extreme BP variability, with associated symptoms, is the clinical hallmark of this dangerous tumor of the adrenal medulla and sympathetic chain. Measurement of catecholamines and their metabolite in urine and/or plasma will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. The notion that chronic mental stress can cause hypertension was an idea in the past often banished to the realm of medical folklore. The general public has needed little persuasion that the link exists, sometimes even using the word \"hypertensive\" as a psychologic descriptor for describing excitable or agitated behavior. Many personally relate to the \"tense\" in \"hypertension\" and may be too ready to attribute their elevated BP to stress in their job or in their domestic life. Although some uncertainty still exists concerning the role of stress in the pathogenesis of human hypertension, clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory research does provide increasingly strong support.11,12 Our own recent research seems to identify the presence of stress biomarkers in patients with essential hypertension.13 In our own country, in an admittedly contentious judgment, an Australian governmental body, the Specialist Medical Review Council, ruled that stress, including stress in the workplace, is one proven cause of hypertension.14 How effective are relaxation therapies, such as relaxation training, meditation, and yoga, and structured stress reduction strategies in domestic and working lives as antihypertensive therapy? Certainly much less effective than expected from this account. Among nonpharmacologic therapies, weight reduction and exercise outrank relaxation therapies and stress reduction strategies in antihypertensive efficacy.15 Patients with depression commonly present with somatic complaints and are incidentally found to have elevated BP. Their negativity can make them sensitive to adverse drug effects. If they are seen by their primary care physicians as \"problem patients,\" they will be more likely than usual to be referred to a hypertension specialist. Depressive illness seems to be common in hospital hypertension clinics, due primarily to this bias in hypertension detection and medical referral. Essential hypertension and depressive illness do not seem to be causally linked other than through adverse drug effects. In the old days, this was due to some antihypertensive drugs causing depressive illness; centrally acting antihypertensives such as reserpine and methyldopa could do this. Now the wheel has turned, with psychotropic drugs sometimes causing hypertension, primarily through promoting weight gain; this leads to hypertension as a component of the metabolic syndrome.16,17 Much of what has been said about drug-induced hypertension in patients with depressive illness applies also for those with schizophrenia. Classic antipsychotic drugs, novel antipsychotics such as olanzapine, antidepressants of all types (including selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake blockers such as venlafaxine), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including paroxetine, prescribed for accompanying depressive illness can cause extreme weight gain, diabetes, and hypertension in patients with schizophrenia.16,17 The tendency for individual psychotropic drugs to cause weight gain is variable, both between patients and across drug classes. Some psychotropic drugs are much more likely than others to cause weight gain (Table II). These should be avoided if possible in those patients who have developed the metabolic syndrome. Schizophrenia is often associated with other cardiac risk factors such as smoking and physical inactivity, making avoidance of obesity and hypertension doubly important. What antihypertensive medication is preferred in psychotropic drug-induced obesity-related hypertension? Although this remains somewhat speculative, there are some pointers. A case for preferential prescribing of antiadrenergic antihypertensive drugs that target the known pathophysiology of obesity-related hypertension, activation of the sympathetic nervous system,18 can be advocated on theoretic grounds, but at present there is little empiric evidence to support this. Perhaps more important is the requirement that chosen antihypertensives do not cause weight gain or increase insulin resistance, predisposing to the development of diabetes. High-dose diuretics are best avoided, if possible, on the latter grounds. β-Adrenergic-blocking drugs also are not ideal,19 having been found in large trials to cause some weight gain, perhaps 1 to 2 kg on average, and to predispose to the development of diabetes.19,20 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been especially recommended, as they appear to be antidiabetic.21 The imidazoline-binding agents such as rilmenidine and moxonidine, which are not available in United States, inhibit sympathetic outflow from the brain, cause weight loss of 1 to 2 kg on average, and increase insulin sensitivity.20,22 Perhaps this is a drug class of the future for obesity-related hypertension? Overall, compliance with treatment instructions is not good in patients with essential hypertension. This perhaps is not surprising for an illness in which treatment rather than relieving existing symptoms aims to achieve the delayed benefits of future freedom from myocardial infarction and stroke. Psychiatric illness can further impair compliance. Negativity and lack of volition in those with comorbid depressive illness or schizophrenia compromises medications taking. So do anxiety disorders; in this case the reason is that somaticized symptoms of anxiety are mistaken for adverse effects of the antihypertensive drugs and the drugs are then stopped. Patients can have high levels of hostility, including some with obsessive compulsive illness, which tends to turn the therapeutic encounter into an unproductive tug-of-war with the physician; treatment recommendations can be resisted. Undiagnosed alcohol abuse, a cause of hypertension, can unfavorably influence attitudes toward health care. Some patients have a strongly held doctrinaire distrust of medication, which they view as potentially toxic, and are reluctant to start treatment, or if they do, they surreptitiously reduce the dose. Some patients may not really wish to get well at all. There are those whose reaction to illness, because of secondary gain or for reasons known only to themselves, prevents recovery. These can be the most difficult patients of all to treat, even for doctors with specialty psychiatric training. When BP measured in the doctor's office or the clinic is misleading, skewed by a white coat effect, self-measurement at home is recommended. Psychiatric comorbidity, however, can render home BP measurement a burden for the doctor and patient alike. Home BP measurement should be orderly, along a regular and proscribed path, with BP values perhaps being carefully tabulated to give a helpful overall depiction of the situation to the doctor at the next medical visit. In patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the timing of BP measurement is often chaotic, driven by the presence of symptoms of anxiety which suggest to the patient that BP is high. When it is, because of the acute anxiety, a path of escalating anxiety and escalating BP may commence, perhaps continuing throughout the day with literally dozens of measurements and more often than not terminating in an anguished late evening phone call to the doctor. Home BP measurement may be too anxiety-engendering for some patients to tolerate. Tabulated home BP measurements, perhaps with an overall summary, are a very helpful aid to the doctor when patients attend clinic visits. Some occupational groups—engineers and accountants come to mind—do this comprehensively and well, often providing elaborate computer printouts of graphs constructed over months derived from 3 or 4 daily BP measurements. This level of attention to detail is usually not really necessary but is helpful nevertheless. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the repeated measurement of BP is sometimes taken to extraordinary levels, with perhaps 40 to 50 measurements daily, this activity sometimes replaces other prior compulsions, such as ritual hand washing. In these cases, home BP measurement has become an expression of the patients' illness and they are better off not doing it. Beyond psychiatric diagnosis, attitudinal barriers to effective treatment of hypertension may be present. Such barriers can be ideologic, as in a zealotry that takes the form of the opinion that \"drugs are poison and made by a corrupt pharmaceutical industry.\" Denial can be a barrier, as in the patients who persistently search for their \"best\" BP, taking home BP measurements under circumstances they have learned will yield lower BP values, such as after a hot bath. An overvaluing of the power of positive thinking can also be a barrier to treatment in patients who believe that they should be able to control their BP by strength of will alone, such that a need to take antihypertensive medication equates with failure and personal weakness. It can actually represent indifference to survival, particularly, it seems, in elderly men. We have found that the magic words to motivate here are \"strokes\" and \"grandchildren\"—antihypertensive medication-taking can be driven by fear of the first and love for the second!

      "abstract": "Abstract: Both physical and mental health is intimately linked. People who have a significant mental illness are more prone to suffer from a variety of chronic physical diseases. People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

      "abstract": "Stress defines a cluster of psychophysiological responses aimed at enabling resources to solve difficult situations, as well as restoring and maintaining homeostasis in the body. Stress is a combination of physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioural and emotional responses to new or threatening stimuli and serves as a protective adaptation of the body under physiological conditions. In accordance with the effect on the body, beneficial and negative stress is distinguished. Stress can be divided into “chronic” and “acute”. The intensity of the physiological response to a stressor is highly individual and situationally dependent. Many variables, including personal attributes, coping strategies, social support, and past experiences may modify the physiological stress response in any given situation and can account for the different response of people exposed to the same stressor. Intense and persistent stress can lead to psychological and pathological body injury. Stress has a significant impact on different brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala etc. Depression, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and even stress-induced mental diseases are closely related to functional and structural damage of the related brain regions. Repetitive daily acute stress can be associated with different diseases, first of all cardiovascular diseases, which affect quality of life and can cut short life expectancy. Timely treatment is required to prevent progression of early stress reactions to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in individuals at high risk. Advanced stress and anxiety management interventions include non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.",

This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

Bipolar depression, i.e. depressive episode(s) as part of bipolar disorder, can be differentiated from unipolar depression only through the previous course of illness. A correct diagnosis therefore may be delayed. The pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression differs from that of unipolar depression due to a high risk of recurrence of either hypomanic/manic or depressive episodes or mood instability. Therefore, long periods of specialized treatment will often be required. Both bipolar and unipolar depression will often benefit from adjunctive social and psychological interventions.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a recurring complex psychopathological mood disorder causing significant impairment in children. PBD spectrum includes bipolar I (full manic episode), bipolar II (depression with hypomania) and bipolar not otherwise specified (NOS) (“others” in mid-spectrum who may be exhibiting prodromal PBD states but do not fit criteria clearly).The clinical presentation of PBD often does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for bipolar disorder (BD), which was developed in adults and not adapted for children. The diagnosis becomes difficult because symptom presentation is variable and largely dependent on developmental age. Although discrete episodes of mania and depression that define BD in adults may match the presentation of some patients who have BD in adolescence, patients who have BD of childhood and prepubertal onset may or may not manifest these clear-cut episodes. The duration of episodes in children may be as short as 1 to 2 days. Mood symptoms can be chronic, can present as predominantly mixed episodes, or can continuously cycle rapidly, with severe irritability or aggression as the usual presenting symptoms. Disruptive behavior, hyperarousal, racing thoughts, elation, and grandiosity also may characterize the moods. A major depressive presentation is associated with a significant risk for developing subsequent BD. Poor psychosocial skills as well as cognitive and attention deficits may manifest along with mood and behavior changes. The chronic relapsing mode of PBD may extend into early adulthood. Longitudinal studies abound on PBD; yet, there is no firm agreement on exactly what constitutes the diagnosis of PBD.Complicating the diagnosis of PBD is the high rate of comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, conduct, substance abuse, and oppositional defiant disorders. Children who have both PBD and ADHD tend to manifest a more severe course of illness, presenting with psychosis and comorbid depression often requiring hospitalization. Although both PBD and ADHD include symptoms of distractibility and hyperactivity, the distinguishing symptoms of mania, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and exhibition of sexual tendencies are present in PBD but usually not in ADHD.PBD is thought to result from an interaction among genetic and environmental risk factors in which family environment is important. The genetic endowment of parents might contribute to the family dysfunction, predisposing already genetically affected offspring to evolution of the disorder. PBD is a highly heritable disorder having a documented genetic determinant, although its basis is not yet fully elucidated. Family history is the most significant risk factor for developing the illness. Studies show an increased risk of psychopathology in the offspring of parents who have BD. Early depression, anxieties, and dysregulated behavior may be useful markers for later development of BD in high-risk children. Those symptoms may be episodic. Some researchers suggest that PBD markers may be detectable almost a decade before the onset of the clinical disorder.Ongoing research is searching to identify PBD prodromes and early risk markers for the later developments of PBD. Clinical staging is proposed in identifying the PBD evolution among at-risk children. Early symptoms in the evolution include abnormalities in temperament, anxiety, sleep disruption, minor mood disturbance, difficulties with emotion regulation, and adjustment problems, progressing into mixed mood episodes, followed by frank bipolarity later in adolescence and adulthood. Heritable biomarkers in the areas of attention, executive function, and affect processing are subjects of ongoing research. There may be structural, functional, and biochemical alterations in the brain predisposing the child to mood instability.Research has suggested that physical, sexual, and emotional childhood traumas that occur at a time of sensitivity of the maturing central nervous system may predispose to and modulate the clinical expression and course of the PBD. Traumas cause organic changes in the brain that lead to mood dysregulation. These changes may result in a rapid cycling course, psychotic features, suicidal behavior, and an earlier age of onset, all of which induce a more severe clinical PBD profile. Traumas can result from any stressful event. Examples include behavioral, educational, family related, or substance abuse induced episodes; negative life events, such as low socioeconomic status, ongoing family conflicts, or low quality of life; or any disappointing life events such as school failure or termination of relationships.As many as two thirds of adults given a diagnosis of BP had symptoms beginning in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of risk and prodrome recognition, along with early and accurate diagnosis that allows intervention before full development of the highly impairing disorder. Expert agreements on what constitute key features and valid biomarkers for PBD diagnosis are needed.Comments: When reviewing community-based studies, the diagnosis of PBD has increased dramatically over the past decade. In retrospective studies in adults, 10% to 20% revealed the onset of symptoms when they were younger than 10 years of age, and 60% when younger than 20 years, with most self-reporting a delay of 10 years in making the diagnosis. Although unfortunate, this finding may not be surprising, because there are less clear diagnostic criteria for children and because pediatricians have not been trained to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis is important in order to initiate appropriate treatment and minimize morbidity and mortality, such as through suicide. As pediatricians, we need to consider the diagnosis in children who exhibit irritability and aggression, and a family history of bipolar disease is important to determine. Future research is needed to better examine treatment options in children and whether earlier treatment will result in better outcomes. The challenge of managing PBD is yet another example of the importance of mental health training for pediatricians and for collaboration with mental health providers to provide the best possible care to our patients.Janet Serwint, MDConsulting Editor, In Brief",

Within gastroenterology, attention has focused on the increased frequency of abuse history, particularly for patients with refractory functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Furthermore, regardless of diagnosis, abuse history can impair health status and one's ability to cope with one's medical condition. Especially for patients with painful functional GI disorders resistant to usual treatments, the physician should inquire in a supportive manner about the possibility of a prior abuse history or other psychosocial traumas (e.g., major loss). This can then lead to an appropriate mental health referral (along with continued medical care) and an improved clinical outcome.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

Because of this, they are brought to the clinician many years after the onset of their symptoms, only when their delusional behavior becomes overt.

      "abstract": "Abstract Conversion disorder (previously called hysteria) describes neurological symptoms such as paralysis, movement disorder, or sudden collapses that are genuine but not related to disease. Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

People who have BD comprise more than 1% of the world’s population from all nationalities, ethnic origins, and socioeconomic statuses. There are four different types of bipolar-related disorders: bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II, cyclothymic disorder, and unspecified BD, which are classified by different patterns of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes. Where manic and hypomanic episodes are both states of increased activity, energy, or agitation, hypomanic episodes only last around four consecutive days and are less severe compared to manic episodes, which last around one week. Depressive episodes are characterised by feelings of despair and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. Like many other psychological disorders, BD is often difficult to diagnose accurately in clinical practice due to large variations in individual symptoms, symptom overlap, or lack of approved biomarkers.

Moreover, it is often difficult to elicit a past history of hypomanic episodes from patients because of its milder presentation.

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

The development of broader, more patient centred outcome measures such as quality of life and “health gain” has also elevated the status of depression, particularly because depressive symptoms are now seen to be the primary contributors to morbidity in some neurological illnesses. Two recent studies showed how depressive symptoms accounted for much more of the variance in morbidity in Parkinson’s disease (40%) than did movement disorder (17%).1,2 Critics of these studies could rightly point out that before the advent of L-dopa, motor disorder was definitely the biggest contributor to morbidity in Parkinson’s disease, and that quality of life as a measure is more directly related to mood state …",

Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a primary psychotic disorder characterized by two or more of hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and/or negative symptoms. At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

A number of experiments are described which show that biochemical, physiological and/or pathological changes in an organism do not seem to be caused by the aversive or noxious nature of the stressor but by the ability or inability of the organism to deal with this stressor. If an individual can cope successfully with the environmental challenge, little or no stress is experienced, the challenge is viewed as only minimal stressful and no major health consequences seem to arise. If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise. Thus, coping strategies available to and employed by an individual will determine whether or not stress is experienced, whether or not an event becomes stressful and whether or not pathological consequences will occur.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

      "abstract": "Any symptom represents a perception of an abnormal internal body state. The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae.

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

      "title": "Hiccups as a myocardial ischemia symptom",
      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

Such pattern, characterised by a prevalent peak in the morning and a secondary one in the evening, strictly resembles that of arterial blood pressure. The lack of differences between the temporal pattern of hypertensive and normotensive subjects suggests that the physiological pattern of blood pressure, and not strictly a condition of hypertension, may play a favouring role in certain hours of the day, probably together other local factors.",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

Symptoms of grief include physical and psychological changes including body aches, anxiety, and emotional pain. Grief has been conceptualized both as a series of stages or phases and as a period of meaning‐making. Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes. Individuals with stronger support networks may experience improved health effects during bereavement.",

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

Hypochondriacal patients misunderstand the nature and significance of these symptoms and believe that they are evidence of serious disease. Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.",

      "abstract": "The compartment syndrome is an entity of rare appearance in sports, if we compare it with the universe of sports injuries; however, it is important to know it, because it induces an emergency medical consultation in sports scenarios, in acute cases, and incapacitates the athlete in chronic cases. The compartment syndrome is mainly associated with contact or endurance sports and its classification is according to the time of appearance, in acute and chronic by overexertion or according to the body site. In order to detect it in an acute presentation, its signs and symptoms can be classically defined in the 5 P's; however, the chronic compartment syndrome could appear with other associated findings, depending on the committed site, making it easily confused with other processes. This entity should be suspected in every sportsman or woman when pain appears that is exaggerated in the affected extremity or body compartment, compared to the mechanism of the injury and when there are signs in the affected extremity to complete the 5 P's, associated or not to the causes that originate it, and the associated risk factors. If the compartment syndrome is suspected, the intra-compartment pressures of an invasive type must be checked by the attending medical professional and, in order to rule it out from other entities, it is useful to send serum para-clinical tests to check for associated muscle necrosis, together with the taking of imaging tests, if technological care allows it. Always when faced with a compartment syndrome, the associated complications must be considered. Early fasciotomy is the treatment of choice and it is up to the specialist to practice it in the acute compartment syndrome. In relation to the chronic compartment syndrome the activity that is being carried out must be suspended, to treat the patient with other measures that could diminish the process, including powerful analgesia, handling of footwear or of surface to avoid to increase it, analgesics under scales of pain of medical type and until drugs like the botulinum toxin A by expert personnel, but always the handling must be expectant and to watch it by a specialist because it could need surgical handling of definitive form. Specialized evaluation and appropriate decision making by sports training staff in a timely manner can avoid temporary or permanent complications in the affected individual. We hope that this review can raise awareness among all sports practitioners, their counselors, and medical and non-medical personnel for better detection of this complication of sports injuries.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is, of course, only a symptom but, like many other symptoms, it occasionally stands alone as representing some functional disturbance of which we have no other means of information. When we speak of the treatment of insomnia as such, we ought not to include the treatment of the pains or discomforts from various known sources which may keep the patient awake, or of many forms of insanity, of delirium tremens or other kinds of poisoning. This narrows our limits very much, but at the same time makes the problem more precise. The practitioner or writer, however, does not get rid of its difficulties by these exclusions, for many of the cases which present no other important symptoms, so that the patient has nothing to tell as to his bodily condition except that he can not sleep, are more difficult to manage successfully than one where we can put a",

He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder. The liaison psychiatrist recommended a multidisciplinary transversal management of the patient.",

Individual in a stressful situation is influenced by his or her mental ability to carry out ongoing tasks. Medical education is highly challenging and often places heavy demands on the mental health of the students. Compared to other fields of education; medical education is evidenced by high prevalence of stress. Educational process exerts an inadvertent negative effect on student’s mental health with a high frequency of depression, anxiety and stress among medical students. Students exposed to work overload and examinations in a competitive environment with constant pressure of assessment brings various changes in their daily habits such as lack of sleep and irregular diet. Mental morbidity is least accounted form of all population health studies and with the threatening rates of mental ill-health and rising rates of deaths due to the lack of early recognition of these morbidities, with not many Indian studies to document this burden. Therefore, the presence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students was assessed using a previously validated and standardized instrument, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) and the associations with their socio-demographic characteristics were identified. The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students and to study the association of stress, anxiety and depression with the socio-demographic characteristics of medical under- graduate students.",

Patients with persistent somatization relentlessly seek medical diagnosis and treatment despite repeated reassurance that physical illness is either absent or insufficient to account for their symptoms and disability. Such abnormal illness behaviour leads to overuse of health care facilities and contributes to the high cost of health care. Somatization may occur transiently in response to stressful life events or it may be persistent and result in chronic partial or total disability. Diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines that may help physicians identify and manage such patients more effectively are discussed.",

Surprisingly, experts cannot agree on exactly how to define burnout, but in recent years it has been recognized as an actual diagnosis among medical professionals. According to the psychologists Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North, there are the 12 stages. Nurse burnout is the causes of physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion related to the job is the most common. Personal and professional stressors are leading nurses to leave the field or retire early at alarming rates. We need to keep our thoughts positive, because our thoughts become our words.",

The diagnosis is established after other causes of anisocoria have been excluded. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of benign episodic mydriasis of her right pupil in a 23-year-old female patient. The episodes lasted for 5-10 minutes and occurred spontaneously, without any concomitant symptoms or precipitating factors. The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Multimodal treatment approaches implementing family and social supports, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral techniques have the strongest evidence base. Psychopharmacologic interventions are not generally used, but may be necessary as an adjunct to other interventions for children with severe reactions or coexisting psychiatric conditions.",

We place much importance upon the patient variables associated with the treatment decisions. We emphasize strong patient involvement in treatment as a way to become panic free and improve level of functioning. Panic disorder is defined in DSM-IV1 as \"The presence of recurrent panic attacks followed by at least one month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attack, or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks.\" A panic attack is defined as \"a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four or more of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes.\" 1) Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; 2) sweating; 3) trembling or shaking; 4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; 5) feeling of choking; 6) chest pain or discomfort; 7) nausea or abdominal distress; 8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint; 9) derealization or depersonalization; 10) fear of losing control or going crazy; 11) fear of dying; 12) paresthesias; 13) chills or hot flashes. The following hypotheses have been used to conceptualize panic disorder from a psychiatrist's perspective.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD. Notable harms exist, including stunted height and possible neurotoxicity.",

One of the most frequently diagnosed, yet under recognized diseases, is depression. Depression, whether a symptom, part of a syndrome or an independent diagnosis, is characterized by feelings of sadness, loss of interest and pleasure in activities that normally bring joy to a person, and can affect how a person feels, thinks and behaves. It affects all age and social groups, as well as both sexes, it is often comorbid with other physical diseases, and increases the risk of developing other physical diseases. There are certain differences between the sexes in the prevalence, the way a certain sex group deals with problems caused by depression, and the possible causes of these differences, which we present in more detail in this paper. Differences are observed in all cultures, environments and across different age groups. Patients suffering from depression have a particularly high risk of committing suicide. Suicide is a psychopathological phenomenon of multifactorial aetiology that is most often associated with psychiatry and mental disorders and is not a diagnosis in itself, but a complication of many psychiatric disorders. here are many differences in the rate of suicide by age and sex, as well as in the method of suicide, which we also present in more detail in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. Psychotic symptoms may also occur during the course of delirium or dementias and may be due to a range of other general medical and neurological conditions, including PD.",

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

As a general rule, sexual activity can be resumed when the patient can walk a kilometre at a comfortable pace or climb two flights of stairs without undue breathlessness. Sexual patterns and positions used prior to the heart attack should be continued. Symptoms that occur during sexual intercourse or any other exercise should be reported to a doctor. Taking more than two alcoholic drinks or eating a large meal may hinder sexual activity. Psychological problems that interfere with sexual function can develop in patients or their partners. Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity. Some people abandon sex after a heart attack because they feel they have aged significantly as a result of their illness. Doctors should ask post-myocardial infarction patients about sexual activity when inquiring about other symptoms and well-being. Given support, understanding and attendance to any associated problems, most patients will recover their normal sexual function after a heart attack. (author abstract)",

      "title": "The Physiological Aspects of the Stress",
      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "abstract": "The disruption of psychosocial functioning (PSF) is currently listed as one of the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and PSF is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of successful treatment of the disease. Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

      "title": "Exercise for depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common clinical condition, affecting over 120 million people worldwide. People experience pervasive, sustained feelings of sadness and hopelessness, persistent loss of interest, enjoyment and motivation as well as disruptions in areas such as appetite, sleep, concentration and energy levels. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and produces a greater decrement in health than chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and angina. Conventional treatments centre largely on pharmacological and psychological strategies, either on their own or in combination; but these are not acceptable to everyone. Antidepressant treatment can be complicated by side effects and drug interactions, and psychological therapies require motivation from the participant. Patients may also reject both antidepressants and psychological therapy because of perceived stigma. For several decades, exercise has been investigated as an alternative therapy for depression and several mechanisms have been proposed for its potential efficacy. It may provide distraction from negative thoughts or enhance a sense of self-efficacy through mastering a new skill. Social contact through exercise may also have a positive impact on mood and, from a more biological perspective, changes to circulating monoamines or endorphins, or reductions in the stress hormone cortisol, may also play a role. This review set out to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials of the effect of exercise in people with depression. We included studies comparing exercise with no treatment, as well as those that compared exercise with psychological or antidepressant approaches. The current version updates the earlier Cochrane Review, first published in 2009. We included trials of adults with a diagnosis of depression as defined by the original researchers. In assessing the intervention, we were guided by the American College of Sports Medicine definition of exercise as \"planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness\". We identified 39 trials, recruiting approximately 2300 participants, drawn from a variety of sources including inpatient and outpatient populations, as well as from the general public by media advertising. A diagnosis of depression was made either by structured diagnostic interview or through the use of rating scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The included trials varied widely with respect to the type of exercise, as well as its duration and frequency or the overall \"dose\" of exercise. Of the 39 trials, 32 provided aerobic exercise such as running, cycling, walking or dance; with 4 providing muscle-strengthening resistance training. Other trials provided a combination of aerobic and resistance training. There were further differences with respect to whether exercise was conducted alone or in groups, indoors or outdoors, supervised or unsupervised. Our main finding was that when compared to a control intervention, there was a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as when we analysed the six trials that were considered high quality, the effect size was clinically small and not statistically significant. A series of subgroup analyses suggested that a larger number of exercise sessions may have a greater clinical effect on mood and that resistance training or a mixture of aerobic and resistance training may be more efficacious than aerobic training alone. When exercise was compared with antidepressant medication, there was no statistical difference between the two interventions. Likewise for psychological therapy, our findings revealed no difference between this and an exercise intervention. The nature and extent to which exercise may have an effect on mood remains uncertain. Most included trials were small and many had methodological weaknesses. One inherent difficulty in these studies is that it is not possible to blind participants allocated to exercise. A further potential source of bias is that outcome measures for depression are often gathered from self-rated scales of depression, completed by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. The evidence in this review would be strengthened by further large-scale, high-quality studies, where all participants are diagnosed with depression through structured clinical interview and receive exercise as a stand-alone intervention. Further research comparing exercise with either anti depressant medication or psychological therapies, would also help resolve uncertainties about the choice between these options.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research has elucidated the bio-psycho-social backgrounds and clinical facts of personality disorders defined in DSM-III-IV Axis II, and has endorsed the clinical value of the diagnoses. However, the concept of personality disorder still remains diaphanous, and requires further clarification. One complication is that personality disorder can be seen from either the perspective that is a milder variant of other Axis I disorders, or that it is an abnormally exaggerated form of normal personality traits. That the disorders can be grouped according to these viewpoints indicates that there may be heterogeneity within them, while they have common characteristics: a long duration, extended areas of affected functioning, subtle and marginal severity of symptoms, and \"person-near\" nature. These features may also account for the difficulty in defining and assessing the disorder. Treatment is another important focus for discussion. Patient-therapist cooperation is essential and of itself is a difficult goal. Most failures of the therapeutic relationship lead to a variety of problems, including legal or ethical ones. Prerequisites for involuntary treatment, remedies for the risk of treatment disruption by violent acting-out and preventing malpractice are issues to be discussed. Inexorably we must return to the principle that our task is to help our patients take ultimate responsibility for decisions about their personality.",

Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders: Special Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations in Women",
      "abstract": "Abstract Bipolar disorder in women presents special diagnostic and treatment challenges to the clinician. The presentation of female bipolar may resemble depressive disorders, comorbid Axis I disorders, Axis II personality disorders, behavioral dysregulation, or general medical disorders; thus, it is critically important for clinicians to assess for a history of hypomania or mania when determining diagnosis in any woman presenting with psychological symptoms. Several gender differences may exist in the epidemiology and symptomatology of bipolar disorder, and each must be kept in mind during assessment. Rapid cycling and mixed states have been associated with female gender and may present diagnostic challenges as each often presents as major depression. Symptoms of postpartum psychosis tend to differ from the symptoms typically seen in bipolar mania; therefore, if postpartum psychosis is actually a manifestation of bipolar disorder, accurate diagnosis depends upon a knowledge of these differences. Special treatment considerations for bipolar disorder in women involve interactions between the illness and the female reproductive cycle. A risk of fetal malformation exists when some mood-stabilizing agents are used during conception and/or during the first trimester of pregnancy. Neurobehavioral teratogenicity and neonatal toxicity is also possible. Careful treatment management is necessary to reduce the risks to the fetus/infant and to effectively manage bipolar disorder in the mother. In treating women with bipolar disorder, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and associated risks of treatment versus no treatment with every patient of reproductive age. Further studies are needed on gestational timing and exposure to mood-stabilizing agents, especially newer agents recently approved or currently being considered for the treatment of bipolar disorder.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "abstract": "After a detailed psychiatric study of 20 patients representing consecutive admissions it is concluded that, generally, emotional factors were intimately involved in ulcer perforations. However, the importance of diet, alcohol, activity, and other concurrent disease also was noted. Perforation usually occurred as a climax to a period of emotional turbulence when the patient faced situations which, consciously or unconsciously, he felt to be grossly damaging to his self-esteem and to which he reacted, predominantly, with impotent rage. The perfection prodrome is described and interpreted as a depressive equivalent. The ulcer patient's ordinal position in his family as the youngest or middle child and his difficulties in relation to his father are emphasized. Particularly where no other serious disease coexists, perforation should be taken as presumptive evidence that the patient has tried unsuccessfully to resolve an emotional crisis and that appropriate psychiatric help probably is indicated as part of the total treatment.",

Humans need stress to perform at their best, but unnecessary, extended stress is eventually unsustainable and, over time, may cause an individual's mental and physical health to deteriorate. The neurosurgical operating room (OR) is a challenging workplace where the team typically cares for critically ill patients who are hemodynamically and neurologically unstable. In a neurosurgical operating room, where the surgeon works on the brain and different arteries and nerves nearby, operating room hours are also lengthy. The neuro-anesthesiologist is often alert and prepared to handle any emergency, which is unsettling and draining. Burnout can result from the delivery of critical care because it causes physical, psychological, and emotional weariness in the healthcare professional.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy.

The patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases leading to decreased functioning which makes the treatment for pain more complicated. Patients who have chronic pain also may benefits from antidepressant medications for improved function and quality of life. To obtain optimal clinical outcomes, it is imperative to address both conditions when planning therapy for and studies of chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common of the affective disorders (disorders of mood rather than disturbances of thought or cognition); it may range from a very mild condition, bordering on normality, to severe (psychotic) depression accompanied by hallucinations and delusions. Worldwide, depression is a major cause of disability and premature death. Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology. This distinction is made clinically, but there is little evidence that antidepressant drugs show significant selectivity between these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Neurosyphilis presents a significant diagnostic challenge in psychiatric settings due to its highly variable neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can mimic a range of other psychiatric disorders. This case report describes a 36-year-old male admitted with acute psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior. His clinical history revealed previously treated syphilis, with no subsequent follow-up, and recent progressive cognitive and behavioral changes, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (specifically general paresis) following serological confirmation. This case highlights the complexities in diagnosing neurosyphilis, as its symptoms often overlap with common psychiatric conditions, making it easy to overlook in routine assessments. Importantly, the diagnosis required a high index of suspicion due to the patient’s psychiatric presentation combined with a background of untreated syphilis. Considering neurosyphilis in the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially when psychiatric symptoms like depression, cognitive decline, and psychosis appear in the absence of clear neurological signs and when there is no follow-up on prior infections. The resurgence of syphilis and its neurological complications remains a concern, particularly in psychiatric populations where risk factors such as substance use disorders, socioeconomic challenges, and limited access to healthcare are prevalent. This case underscores the critical role of psychiatrists in screening for syphilis, especially in patients at risk or in areas with high syphilis prevalence. Early and accurate diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment using penicillin, can halt disease progression and mitigate severe neuropsychiatric outcomes. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in psychiatric patients and considering neurosyphilis in cases of unexplained psychiatric symptoms.",

It is associated with an increased risk of death, not only through suicide but also from physical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. It is under-recognized and undertreated and it should be screened for in those at high-risk for depression such as those suffering from chronic physical health problems. Its aetiology is multifactorial and comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is common. Assessment of depression requires the clinician to determine the duration, symptom severity, suicide risk and functional impairment in the current episode, co-morbid diagnoses, past mood and treatment history, as well as a developmental, social and family history. Treatment is guided by illness severity, presentation and prior history and includes psychosocial interventions, medication and their combination, with antidepressant medication reserved for persistent and moderate-to-severe depression. Prevention of relapse is a priority and risk factors for this should be assessed and used to guide prophylactic drug and psychological treatment.",

It is precipitated by medical illness, substance intoxication/withdrawal or medication effect. Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited. Current pharmacologic options include the typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and the benzodiazepines. These therapeutic options are reviewed in detail.",

However, a number of medical disorders have symptoms that overlap with panic disorder symptoms, and elevated panic disorder prevalence is comorbid with a number of medical illnesses, including respiratory disorders, vestibular dysfunction, and hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The presence of medical comorbidity complicates the identification, presentation, and treatment of panic disorder. In addition, comorbid mood disorders occur commonly and result in greater severity, poorer quality of life, and greater impairment. Recent work suggests that panic disorder occurs more commonly with bipolar disorder than major depressive disorder, resulting in substantial impairment, as well as poorer response to treatment. The implications of mood disorder and its medical comorbidity for the identification and treatment of panic disorder are discussed.",

Anxiety in turn makes it more difficult for the patient to cope with suffering. In advanced disease, anxiety is often associated with depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect.

      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The absence statuses, which manifest themselves clinically as a simple dullness of consciousness, constitute only a part of the episodic psychic disturbances accompanying the generalized protracted spike and wave discharges. In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses. RÉSUMÉ Les états 'absence, qui cliniquement se manifestent par une simple obnubilation de la conscience, ne constituent qu'une partie des troubles psychiques qui accompagnent les décharges généralises et prolongées de complexes pointe‐onde. Dans 'autres cas, et en particulier quand les décharges sont plus atypiques, les manifestations psychiques peuvent revêtir 'aspect 'un simple trouble du comportement, ou 'un état confusionnel avec agitation et onirisme, ou encore 'aspect 'un état de stupeur. Les états de mal temporal, qui sont beaucoup plus rares, se manifestent soit comme une succession de crises psychomotrices, soit comme des épisodes confusionnels ou confusionnel‐oniriques prolongées.

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

Alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person's concern is markedly excessive. The preoccupation is associated with many time consuming rituals such as mirror gazing or constant comparing. BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised. There is evidence for the benefit of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in high doses for at least 12 weeks, as in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is no evidence of any benefit of antipsychotic drugs or other forms of psychotherapy.",

Evidence suggest that mood and anxiety disorders are intrinsic to the neurobiology of dystonia, but also that psychiatric co-morbidity can be secondary to pain experience and the psychosocial functioning and quality of life of the patients. Medical treatment of dystonia with botulinum toxin injections into affected muscles or with deep brain stimulation surgery improves the symptoms as well as mood and the quality of the patients and does not produce any adverse effects on cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "About 35% of subjects with head injury (HI) suffer from postconcussion syndrome (PCS). These disturbances can be chronic or even permanent. Such patients are discharged from hospital without any apparent problems, but it is often the case that their families, and sometimes even they themselves, start to notice the emergence of new problems. They may exhibit affective changes, such as thinking that they are worthless, alone and without any future perspectives. When they are left without the help of specialists and/or family and friends, their problems gain even greater significance. PCS includes subjective physical complaints (i.e. headache, dizziness) and cognitive, emotional and behavioral changes. PCS influences all areas of the patient's life. Subjects who have sustained head injury often have problems with marital relationships, maintaining of independence, employment, leisure activities and other functions which are related to social adjustment. Various studies have attempted to predict the post-injury status of HI patients from information available, such as data on the severity of head injury, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and the results of neuropsychological assessment. This kind of prediction is important in planning of rehabilitation services and thus improving the kind of help available to survivors of HI. Early prediction of post-injury psychological status may also help the patient and his family in coping with the difficulties related to the trauma. We know a great deal about head injury and its consequences, but many questions still need to be answered. Among these are issues such as: the role of neurobehavioral data in the prediction of outcome for HI patients, the identification of variables determining the extent of PCS and the search for reliable factors which may influence future employment or school status. The assessment of patients for invalidity and other social security benefits also requires a more rational approach, based on the data available.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels. Therefore the exploration of symptoms in patients with MUS should focus on the exact chronology of the symptoms themselves, including where and when the symptoms appear.

In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks.

He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

This reaction consists of bodily symptoms and disturbances in relations, both interpersonal (withdrawl, irritability, and resentment) and intrapersonal (depressed mood, loss of pleasure in usual activities, helplessness, and injured self-esteem). The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it. Treatment involves several roles of the doctor and his explicit or implicit use of some psychotherapeutic techniques in his medical practice. Four case histories illustrate these principles.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry.

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat.

      "abstract": "The medically unexplained complaint is often a symptom of hypochondriacal concerns. Patients with hypochondriasis may be managed with either naive realism or consideration of morbid categorization or via dimensional assessment of illness beliefs and behaviors. Naive realism will foster focus somatization and promote regression as well as lead to needless tests and treatments. Attention to categorical entities such a major depression or anxiety disorders will alert the clinician to comorbid psychiatric disorders that respond to traditional psychiatric treatments. Finally, by assessing the domains of illness behaviors such as disease conviction, beliefs in organic versus psychological causes, and denial, the clinician can document and then confront abnormal cognitive schema that revolve around somatic concerns that are a proxy for psychosocial difficulties.",

      "abstract": "The presence of physical symptoms that do not correlate with a disease process are often frustrating to healthcare professionals, are difficult to diagnose and may consume an inordinate proportion of healthcare resources. However, proper and complete physical and psychological assessment and treatment is becoming increasingly possible and essential. Physical illness may occur concomitantly and sometimes as a result of psychological distress, which has displayed itself in a diagnosed mental illness. In other cases physical symptoms may be caused by unconscious dynamics, and the process becomes the primary presenting mental concern. In other cases the physical illness is part of a conscious process and motivated by the hope of gain. Differentiation between physical symptoms of unconscious and conscious origin is important in selecting the correct response. A manager must first of all be alert for physical symptoms that appear to be consciously motivated, as in a disorder called \"malingering.\" The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation. Managers may inadvertently encourage malingering in the workplace by inappropriate responses to employees who present a physical complaint that is consciously motivated for gain. When the manager can recognize this phenomenon as malingering, appropriate managerial intervention can cause this behavior to be controlled and even eliminated and thus enhance productivity.",

Several psychotropic drug classes and combinations have been associated with a classic clinical syndrome of hyperthermia, skeletal muscle hyper-metabolism, rigidity or rhabdomyolysis, autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status ranging from catatonic stupor to coma. It is critical for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for these relatively uncommon drug-induced adverse effects and to become familiar with their management to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. Although these syndromes look alike, they are triggered by quite different mechanisms, and apart from the need to withdraw or restore potential triggering drugs and provide intensive medical care, specific treatments may vary. Clinical similarities have led to theoretical speculations about common mechanisms and shared genetic predispositions underlying these syndromes, suggesting that there may be a common \"thermic stress syndrome\" triggered in humans and animal models by a variety of pharmacological or environmental challenges.",

      "abstract": "Rapid hormonal changes during pregnancy as well as psycho-social stressors accompanying parenthood have often been associated with peripartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder or with not yet clinically expressed bipolar diathesis. Yet, little is known about the correlation of peripartum onset of bipolar disorder in men. We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder with peripartum onset and subsequent episodes following the peripartum initiation of the disease, as well as the association of the couvade syndrome, as a pathological response to a man due to hormonal shifts observed in males cohabiting with a pregnant female. The patient had his first depressive episode during the peripartum period of his spouse, followed by two mixed episodes with psychotic features that leaded to his compulsory psychiatric evaluation and subsequent hospitalization and the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder I. There is a well-known correlation between the peripartum period and mood disturbances to the point of inducing full blown episodes, suggesting of a bipolar disorder initiation or mood episodes relapsing in female patients already diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Due to the patient's psychological disturbances and the phenomenology of his symptoms, mainly concerning the psychotic features accompanying his episodes, we discuss the possible underlying biological correlates as a triggering mechanism, that might overlap the manifestation of the Couvade Syndrome as well as the initiation or relapse of Bipolar Disorder in males. It seems that males are not less influenced by hormonal and psycho-social factors posed upon them during the peripartum period of their cohabiting female spouse.",

      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a behavioral syndrome associated with various neurological conditions that typically manifests as uncontrollable laughing or crying. PBA can significantly impact the quality of life of patients affected as these spells can be inappropriate to the social setting or incompatible with the patient's emotional state. The underlying mechanism of PBA appears to be associated with disinhibition in neuronal pathways involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. One hypothesis for the pathology of PBA is that it is the result of disruption of the corticopontine-cerebellar circuits, impairing cerebellar modulation of affect, and leading to uncontrolled emotional lability. Stroke, and other neurological disorders, interrupt these neuronal circuits causing disinhibition of the voluntary control of emotional expression. It is extremely important to recognize and appropriately diagnose the condition. We present a case report of an 85-year-old female patient who presented with a thalamic stroke, and she subsequently developed hypomania with symptoms of decreased need for sleep, mood lability, pressured speech, and religious preoccupation. This case discusses a unique presentation of PBA with hypomania.",

Objectives Increase knowledge about paraphrenia, a classic diagnosis that no longer appears on international classifications. Methods Extensive research on the historical path of the paraphrenia diagnostic entity was carried out. Patient’s data is obtained from medical history and psychiatric interviews done during her hospitalizations. Results 68 year-old patient attended the hospital emergency service due to a demonic possession delusion that emerged when she was 44 year-old, when she first consulted a psychiatrist because she believed someone introduced the demon inside her body. She described kinesthetic hallucinations as “movements of her brain” and an intense headache, both originated by the demon; as well as other types of hallucinations and confabulations. However, there was no deterioration in her personaliy or her intellectual capacity, as it could have been seen in a case of schizophrenia. This clinical case is considered a paraphrenia phantastica as it presents the typical features raised by the classic authors (mainly Henry Ey): paralogical thought dominance, megalomania, confabulation and integrity of relation with reality. Conclusions Current internacional classifications do not consider paraphrenia as a differentiated diagnostic entity, as it also occurs with other classical entities. This causes a loss of important tools that would achieve a better approach to the patient’s condition. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Guidelines in the management of diabetic nerve pain clinical utility of pregabalin",
      "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. It presents as a variety of syndromes for which there is no universally accepted unique classification. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

Such patients are ubiquitous in all medical care settings, pose difficult diagnostic and management problems, and overutilize health care thus contributing to its cost. Somatization may be transient or persistent, and may or may not be associated with a diagnosable medical or psychiatric disorder. The most common concurrence of somatization is with affective and anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, the somatoform disorders. Persistent somatization poses a serious clinical, social, and economic problem and hence early identification of potential chronic somatizers should be attempted to avoid its development. Pain, fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea are the commonest symptoms. Etiology of somatization is multifactorial and so should be its management.",

      "abstract": "Patient Scenario: An adolescent female youth soccer athlete, with a previous concussion history, suffered a second concussion 4 wk ago. Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

      "abstract": "Two or more attacks of hypomania, mania, depression, or mixed episodes, interspersed with euthymic intervals, constitute bipolar disorder (BD). Among the leading causes of disability globally, BD is a major concern. Among all mental health illnesses, sexual dysfunction is underestimated and more common in the general population compared to those with mental health issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual abnormalities and behaviors that are often seen in bipolar female patients. Final thoughts: Sexual dysfunctions and abnormal behaviors were more common in women with BD. Manic episodes are associated with increased hazardous sexual conduct in people with BD. Additionally, it was mentioned that couples' sexual pleasure is negatively impacted by hypersexuality during manic episodes and hyposexuality during depressed episodes, and this effect typically continues into the times between episodes. On the other hand, sex may be linked to negative emotions rather than diminished desire during depressed periods. Individuals with mental health illnesses have a greater chance of sexual difficulties damaging personal interactions and quality of life.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

      "title": "Evaluación de funciones cognitivas: atención y memoria en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Evidence from recent studies about the epidemiology of panic disorder (PD) indicates that it is present in 4.7% of general population. In Mexico City, 2.9% of females and 1.9% of males are affected by this disease. Due to the incidence cited above, it is considered an important mental health problem that has impacted social, labor and familiar areas. On the other hand, PD is frequently present in comorbidity with other disorders like major depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk. PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities. One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes. Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry «Ramon de la Fuente» in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions. We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory. Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms. The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p<0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12. The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control. According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls. In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency. This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder. In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations. Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.",

There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management.

      "abstract": "Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage1. Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

      "abstract": "Mental stress in humans, on the face of it, is the perception of unease, of various degrees, in response to stressors, such as, threats, emotional, economic, socioeconomic and political instabilities, and other conditionssome due to geopolitical conditions and some emblematic of modern timeswhich create intense and/or difficult brain engagements. However, since such perception, besides serving as the alarm phase, could also be indicative of other, and often adverse, physiological effects, it has been the subject of much research since the early decades of last century [1-5]. These efforts, which have resulted in a vast body of the very valuable scientific findings, revolve around the physiological processes that stressors prompt in the biologic system; and how they affect its equilibrium, i.e., its homeostasis. But how the physiological processes are triggered through involvement of sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as other systemsthe underlying cause of what can be considered the over-drive engagements of these systemshas seemingly escaped scientific scrutiny and remains unanswered; perhaps because it does not have much bearing on the medical treatments of the ensuing effects of sustained (chronic) stress sensation, and also mainly because much about the details of brain processing of sensory data has not been clearly figured out, though the role of the brain in perception of the world, and life as a whole, has been widely recognized since the enlightenment era; early 17th century. However progress, in last few decades, in understanding modus operandi of the brain, has led to further recognition of the fact that much of the brain operations are computational in nature: It is inferred that brain, and the rest of the nervous system, comprise extensive computational machinery that process all sense-relayed information; using its innate (evolutionary-formulated) instructions, imbedded in its constructs (as patterns), for analyzing events and creating perceptions. In the context of such idealization of the operation of the brain [6], this work is an attempt to throw some light on the puzzle of stress; suggesting a mechanism for creation of its sensation, and the prompting of the physiologic effects.",

Self-injurious behavior or compulsion refers to any voluntary action resulting in self-damage. Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "abstract": "Abstract Symptoms are the body's major signaling device, but symptoms often are frustratingly vague, subjective, and ill reported. In addition, challenges attend making decisions about an individual's ability to function based solely on the medical diagnosis, particularly when impairment is subtle or subjective. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a model for understanding the limits of the medical approach to determining impairment and disability. A protocol from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is used to define CFS. This protocol is not a list of diagnostic criteria, and some patients with chronic fatigue may not meet the CDC definition. The syndrome reflects dysfunction in the neuroendocrine system similar in some ways to that seen with depressive illness, and most patients seen for this condition fulfill the criteria for depression, which is another illness characterized by fatigue and somatic complaints. Physicians who evaluate and treat patients with subtle persistent illness know that employers and coworkers respond less positively to an employee's needs when illness is subtle than when impairment is obvious. Physicians must be clear about the family, job, and employment risks patients take when they stay out of work for medical reasons; they also must recognize the risk these patients take when they continue to work despite impaired performance.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms.

Depression and epilepsy may exacerbate each other. Epilepsy with seizure foci in the temporal lobe may represent a higher risk of developing depression, especially if the seizures do not generalize. Treatment of depression is multifaceted and includes psychotherapy and sophisticated regimens of anticonvulsants. Most antidepressants may be used safely and effectively in the context of depression, although high-quality evidence is lacking. Ultimately, treatment of comorbid mood disorder has important implications for outcome and quality of life, perhaps even more than treatment of epilepsy itself.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

      "abstract": "Der Begriff pramenstruelles beinhaltet eine Vielzahl von somatischen und psychischen Veranderungen, die im Zusammenhang mit der Menstruation auftreten. Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u. Yen 1981). Kritisch ist bei",

Some investigators tend to emphasize the effect of psychologic activity on electroencephalographic activity.† Others tend to regard the psychologic activity as the affected variable and the electroencephalographic activity as the causal agent variable.‡ Psychologic activity (itself a concomitant of some kind of cortical and subcortical neurogenic processes) can possibly have either an inhibiting or a facilitating effect on the functioning of another region of the brain showing abnormal bioelectric discharges. At the same time, a region of abnormal bioelectrical discharge may suppress or facilitate neurogenic activity—and thus psychologic activity—in the same region or elsewhere in the central nervous system.

      "title": "Psychosomatic Disorder: The Current Implications and Challenges",
      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been increasing global concern about the rising prevalence and rapid progression of psychosomatic disorders (PD). This surge can be attributed to irregular biological conditions and the increasingly stressful lifestyles that individuals lead, ultimately resulting in functional impairments of vital organs. PD arises from intricate interactions involving the central nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. Notably, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis plays an essential role, as its dysregulation is influenced by prolonged stress and psychological distress. Consequently, stress hormones, including cortisol, exert detrimental effects on immunological function, inflammation, and homeostatic equilibrium. It emerges as physical symptoms influenced by psychological factors, such as persistent pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, or respiratory complications, and is pertinent to highlight that excessive and chronic stress, anxiety, or emotional distress may engender the onset or exacerbation of cardiovascular disorders, namely hypertension and heart disease. Although several therapeutic strategies have been proposed so far, the precise etiology of PD remains elusive due to the intricate nature of disease progression and the underlying modalities of action. This comprehensive review seeks to elucidate the diverse classifications of psychosomatic disorders, explicate their intricate mechanisms, and shed light on their impact on the human body, which may act as catalysts for the development of various other diseases. Additionally, it explores the inherent medico-clinical challenges posed by PD and also explores the cutting-edge technologies, tools, and data analytics pipelines that are being applied in the contemporary era to effectively analyze psychosomatic data.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

The authors present some case studies of personality disorders, in which the principal symptom at admission was violent behavior. The psychiatric action was limited by therapeutic solutions and ethic issues. According to literature there’s an association between personality disorders and criminal behavior.

      "abstract": "The term stress has become part of the lay vernacular, and is widely used as a ready explanation for a number of problems from health complaints to work \"burnout\" and job dissatisfaction. Stress is usually viewed as a mediator, that is, an unobservable inferred construct which is hypothesized to account for a certain observable behaviour such as health or illness differences between individuals. The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

It is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for approximately one quarter of general practice consultations and half of all outpatient attendances and hospital admissions in the UK (Royal College of Physicians, 1996). For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

The\r\n traumatic event for every man is sudden, unexpected, embarrassing, and in such events the\r\n person is never ready. Every hour, someone becomes a victim of violence, a victim of a\r\n psychological trauma, either directly or as a witness. Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder. If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis. The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment. The first contact of the patient and his\r\n family with the doctor is through a medical interview, and by the arrival of the patient in the\r\n institution and the search for professional help, the health care service begins to be provided on\r\n an individual level for each patient in a holistic approach involving the entire health care team\r\n employees.\r\n Social awareness of human rights, violence and disasters has increased over the last 20 years,\r\n which has contributed to wars and natural disasters, which has led to the development of\r\n psychotraumatology. In Croatia, the area of psychotraumatology began to develop more\r\n intensively at the beginning of the 90s of the last century or during the Homeland War.",

      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

Admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute disease carries a high level of stress for families, as the disease is of sudden onset and is life-threatening. The incidence of PTSD (21%) was significant among parents well after their child was discharged from the PICU. Symptoms of PTSD include reexperiencing the traumatic event through recurrent, intrusive recollections, repetitive play, or distressing dreams; avoidance of associations with the event through restricted affect and feelings of detachment; and hyperarousal symptoms such as sleep difficulties, poor concentration, irritability, aggression, and physiological reactivity to trauma-related events. In addition to general hyperarousal symptoms, children may complain of stomachaches and headaches. There have been many summaries and reviews of research published regarding the effects of hospitalization with these children. Findings indicate that the experience is, indeed, stressful and that children may experience fear phenomena, regression, sadness, separation anxiety, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and aggressive behaviors. There was a positive correlation between PTSD symptoms in parents and PTSD symptoms in the child, length of admission and perceived threat of illness to the child’s life. In PICU admissions cause greater disruption to a child’s life, with longer admissions, greater time off school and more paediatric out-patient contacts and hospital re-admissions in the 6–12 months after discharge.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traditionally medicine had its share of patients with mental derangement or behavioral disorder, and medical texts included the careful description of these symptoms and their treatment. While in some patients these disturbances preceded the onset of other recognizable physical symptoms, were concomitant with them or subsided with recovery, in still others the mental symptoms or disordered behavior remained. In yet another group of patients mental symptoms or disordered behavior was all that a physician could discern. The situation was further complicated by the fact that there was much overlap among these groups of patients, and that relatively few patients with mental symptoms only came to the attention of physicians. After all a physician was called only when there was grave concern for a sick person and when the physician’s services could be afforded. When the physician was consulted no radically different measures of treatment were prescribed, since medical theory provided guidelines for the treatment of all diseases. In the majority of cases, mental, emotional, or behavioral changes were concomitants of many diseases, and there was no need for a special literature to address these secondary changes, or complications. People who developed mental or behavioral changes without other discernible signs of illness were not necessarily candidates for medical attention; even today we are still uncertain whether all instances of disturbed behavior represent an illness. In such cases, as in all others, the economics of the patient’s situation played an important role, and physicians were ready to interpret a variety of complaints as medical problems when the patient could afford their services.",

Doctors, including psychiatrists, seldom question this goal to which, indeed, most dedicate their working life. The behavioural abnormality may be phobic avoidance or a compulsive ritual or it may be a specific act such as suicide in the context of severe depression. Symptoms in psychiatry are psychological but physical symptoms may also be prominent, especially in anxiety and depression. Pious platitudes abound concerning the usefulness of non-systematic clinical observations. The clinician's solution to this problem is to use as his working standard, not a formal diagnosis, but an informal formulation. The usual design is the parallel-groups design where patients are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatments. Cogent reasons are needed not to use this standard approach.",

There are general similarities among the different somatoform disorders that may help guide a healthcare provider's evaluation. There are inherent difficulties to evaluating SD patients in the emergency department (ED) which may contribute to both patient and physician discontent. Stronger treatment alliances with healthcare providers form if patients do not feel blamed for producing their unintentional symptoms. A treatment alliance can start in the ED, but ideally continues with inpatient or outpatient mental healthcare professionals or other specialists.

Evaluating functional overlay and differentiating between this concept and organic conditions is important in medicolegal areas in which financial values are placed on pain and disability. Functional overlay is not malingering: the former is based on preconscious or unconscious mechanisms, the latter is consciously induced. In considering psychologic reactions to pain and disability, a gradient of simulation, malingering, symptom exaggeration, overvaluation, functional overlay and hysteria is useful. The dynamics of overlay are a combination of anxiety from body-image distortion and depression from decreased efficiency of the body, as well as the resulting psychosocial disruption in a patient's life.",

A wide range of psychiatric conditions are often comorbid with chronic pain and chronic pain conditions, negatively impacting successful treatment of either condition. The psychiatric condition receiving most attention in the past with regard to chronic pain comorbidity has been major depressive disorder, despite the fact that many other psychiatric conditions also demonstrate epidemiological and genetic overlap with chronic pain. Further understanding potential mechanisms involved in psychiatric and chronic pain comorbidity could lead to new treatment strategies both for each type of disorder in isolation and in scenarios of comorbidity.",

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a mood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania, hypomania, and depression. While it often manifests in early adulthood, it can persist or emerge in later life, posing unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the elderly population. This abstract explores the clinical aspects, diagnostic intricacies, and therapeutic considerations of BD in older adults. Objectives This study aims to shed light on the epidemiology and clinical presentation of BD in the elderly, discuss the diagnostic challenges, and address the complexities of treatment and management in this age group. Methods A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, encompassing epidemiological studies, clinical trials, case reports, and expert guidelines from the past decade. The search was performed using medical databases such as PubMed and Medline. Results BD in the elderly presents with a range of clinical complexities that differentiate it from presentations in younger adults. These complexities include atypical features as elderly individuals may exhibit less overt manic or hypomanic symptoms, resembling irritability rather than euphoria; depressive episodes can be more prevalent and prolonged, leading to potential misdiagnosis as unipolar depression; medical comorbidities: older adults with BD often have more medical conditions, complicating treatment; cognitive impairment: cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia, is common and distinguishing it from neurodegenerative conditions requires specialized assessment; mixed episodes, in older adults may experience mixed episodes, requiring intensive treatment; diagnostic challenges: overlapping symptoms with other disorders make accurate diagnosis challenging. Treatment includes mood stabilizers like lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine, and atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine or aripiprazole. Treatment response varies, requiring consideration of age-related pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions. Non-pharmacological interventions, including psychoeducation, tailored cognitive-behavioural therapies, and psychosocial support, are essential. Conclusions In summary, BD in the elderly demands a customized, multidisciplinary approach to navigate diagnostic complexities and optimize treatment, considering comorbidities and cognitive factors. Enhanced clinical awareness and holistic care are essential for effective management in this population. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Alexithymia, Clinical and Therapeutic Aspects",
      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "A different perspective on bipolar disorder?: epidemiology, consequences, concept, and recognition of bipolar spectrum disorder in the general population",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive illness, is a mood disorder in which episodes of mania, hypomania and depression occur in alternation with intervals of normal mood. Bipolar disorder is typically a recurrent illness and may have serious consequences such as poor social and occupational functioning, impaired quality of life, hazardous behaviour that may be destructive to patients and their relatives, and a high rate of suicide. In addition to the fact that current treatment options are only partially effective in many cases, the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder is problematic due to a number of other factors: a delay in help-seeking by patients, underdiagnosing mood disorder in general practice and mental health care, and misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as unipolar depressive disorder. Indeed, many studies have reported long delays between the onset of first symptoms of the illness and receiving the correct diagnosis and treatment. The majority of these studies were done in clinical samples, which means that the patients included suffered from a more severe form of bipolar disorder and had sought treatment Hence, little is known about the effect of the above mentioned factors in patients in the general population, and consequently little is known of factors influencing help-seeking and receiving adequate treatment. Another point of interest is that the current concept of bipolar disorder is mainly based on studies in clinical samples, and one can question whether this reflects the true nature of mood disorder and encompasses what is often called the bipolar spectrum. Research in the general population offers a unique opportunity to study a wider range of expressions of mood disorder, its consequences, diagnostic process and treatment history in a naturalistic setting not influenced and biased by help-seeking behaviour. In this thesis we report on four studies into the nature, prevalence and consequences of bipolar spectrum disorder as well as a study into factors influencing help-seeking and receiving treatment in the Dutch general population.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

Clinical correlates of post-stroke depression include severity of physical and cognitive impairment as well as location of brain injury. Perhaps the most compelling reason to identify post-stroke depression, however, is its substantial impact on recovery in activities of daily living, cognitive function, and survival. Antidepressant medication has been shown to effectively treat depression, although its administration may require careful clinical monitoring. Other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders include mania, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, apathy, and pathological crying. Controlled studies have not documented the effect of these disorders on long-term recovery, but the potential impact of syndromes such as mania and apathy on rehabilitation efforts or pathological crying on social functioning are evident. With the exception of pathological crying, which has been shown to respond to antidepressant drug therapy, the other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders need to be evaluated in controlled treatment trials for response to therapy.",

The symptoms are recognized for what they are and respond rapidly to reassurance, mild sedation, and effective treatment of the obvious disease or injury. On the other hand, many patients come with anxiety of more obscure cause. It may manifest itself as fatigue, nervousness, tenseness, headache, insomnia, indigestion, or a host of other symptoms.

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex phenomenon that continues to defy one unifying scientific explanation. Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

The condition can manifest itself in several ways and can be triggered in different scenarios, facts that render it a peculiar and multifaceted clinical entity. Nosologically, insomnia can be understood as a symptom or as a disorder with its own characteristics and has a chronic course. Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand.

Among the causes of depression it is necesary to consider genetic, psychological, and enviromental factors, distinguishing between factors of predisposition or vulnerability and leading factors. With regards to the clinical repercussions, it is necesary to emphasize the difficulty in carrying out a diagnosis, since often it in a masked form. In spite of this, depression in old age is accompanied with a typical sympthomatology, among which is distinguished motivational, cognitive, mood, and organic symtphoms. Also it is a remarkable series of psychosocial factors that determine the appearance of depression: isolation, loneliness, retirement, loss wanted beings or social and familiar rejection.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric diseases are clearly different from other physical diseases in that the pathophysiology of the diseases is still unknown. Therefore, except for dementia and epilepsy, there are no objective biomarkers for diagnosis. A set of examinations is performed to rule out physical diseases, but there is no diagnostic evaluation tool for depression that corresponds to, for example, blood pressure, blood glucose, x-rays, or echocardiography. The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different. Another barrier regarding drug treatment is that high-molecular-weight drugs cannot reach the central nervous system due to the blood-brain barrier.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "abstract": "Background Headaches associated with physical exertion include headache precipitated by coughing or other Valsalva maneuvers, headache brought on by prolonged physical exercise, sexual headaches and cardiac cephalalgia. Objective To review and update the clinical characteristics, etiologies, pathophysiology and management of these headaches related to exertion. Methods In depth review of the publications, both in PubMed and in the main textbooks, of the different headaches induced by physical exercise. Results Cough, exercise and sexual headaches can be primary or secondary; therefore, complementary studies are mandatory to rule out structural lesions. However, clinical characteristics, such as an old age and response to indomethacin for cough headache or being a young male and response to beta-blockers for exercise and sexual headaches, plus a normal examination are suggestive of a primary etiology. Etiology for secondary varieties, as posterior fossa lesions for cough headache or vascular malformations for exercise and sexual headaches, are also different. Finally, headache as a distant manifestation of myocardial ischemia, also known as “cardiac cephalalgia”, appears at exertion in around two-thirds of cases and typically lasts less than 30 minutes and is relieved by nitroglycerine. Conclusions Primary and secondary cough headache can usually be suspected based on clinical characteristics and separated from exercise and sexual headaches, which share many aspects. Cardiac cephalalgia is not necessarily an exertional headache and should be considered in adult patients with short lasting headaches and patent vascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings, and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

      "abstract": "Similar to the setting of other chronic, debilitating diseases, considerable psychoeducational support of the patient's family and other caregivers represents an often-overlooked component of appropriately thorough care. Nearly three of four persons caring for an individual with PD report psychological stress and anxiety, which are exacerbated by concerns about progression of the disease. Counseling for PD caregivers can be dispensed particularly effectively through individual psychological counseling as well as PD support and community self-help groups that assist caregivers in sharing concerns and promote a sense they are understood by others. Through such measures, which may be delivered effectively by nurse practitioners, PD caregivers can develop effective coping strategies for disease related stressors. Empirical results show the most common stressors are: anxiety, concern about the future, impatience or intolerance, loss of autonomy, sleep disturbances, diminished time and opportunity for recreation and social contact, and anger. These sequelae often ensue when the PD patient evidences depression, advanced dementia, or psychosis, each of which can severely constrain communication. Caregivers often must also contend with two other adverse psychological phenomena: cognitive dissonance surrounding placement of the patient in a nursing home and learned helplessness, which may predispose to depressive states. Other often unmet needs of the \"hidden victims\" of PD include compromised immune function, social stigmata, and financial difficulties. Respite care may be useful in reducing the stress associated with these and other problems frequently affecting caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic and recurrent disorder, a brain disorder that causes changes in a person’s mood, energy, and ability to function. Patients have alternate increased mood and activities (mania, hypomania, or “ups” period) and declining mood and activities (depressive or “downs” period) in their life. Symptoms of the manic episodes of bipolar disorder include sensitive feelings, lack of rest, and shot up self-esteem, while the depressive episodes bring loss of interest, more or less sleep than usual, anxiety, a feeling of worthlessness, and lack of concentration. Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder with a fairly high prevalence of 1%- 2% and is the 5th cause of disability in the world. Many factors have been considered to contribute to this disorder. While there is strong evidence that some genetic and environmental factors are associated with bipolar disorder, only a few can provide sufficient evidence to establish causality. This report discusses the case of a new manic episode of bipolar disorder that occurs in a woman aged 25 years old who works as a public figure, announcer, and entertainer. The patient has been hospitalized several times and received various pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy but still having difficulties in managing the ups and downs of her emotion. A lot of individual factors must be considered in managing patients with bipolar disorder.",

Importantly, however, although considered primary headaches after a period of observation, many can present, at least initially, as manifestations of other conditions.

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a cognitive process that disrupts consciousness, identity, or memory. It is frequently used as a form of defense in response to significant stress or trauma. In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

The course of diagnosis and treatment in this case suggests a close temporal relationship does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship on a physiologic level. User's Guide for the SCID-5-CV Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders elaborate that the diagnosis of \"……due to another medical condition\" is relatively rare, and co-morbidity between psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases is much more common. Therefore, the relationship between somatic diseases and psychiatric disorders requires careful study of symptom correlation and more time for observational follow-up. When in doubt, the examiner's default assumption should be that the somatic disease is not the cause (i.e., the psychiatric disorder is primary).",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is common in presenile population. The overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric disorders can lead to wrong/late diagnosis which cause delays/difficulties regarding case-management. Especially, long-standing and/or late-onset depression can descriptively envelop bvFTD (behavioral-variant) and leads to unnecessary treatments and increased distress. It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "A review on pain and its signals modulation by body",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

      "title": "Evaluation and Comparison of the Effects of Time Perspective Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Narrative Therapy on Severity of Symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common disorder and due to its debilitating nature, it causes serious problems for the patient, and his/her family. Some of its repercussions are loss of self-confidence, disappointment, reduction in educational and professional performance, personal failure in social relationships. According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), OCD is classified as a separate class of psychological disorders; while it has been classified under anxiety disorders in the DSM-IV. According to DSM-5, observance of both or each one of obsession and compulsion symptoms is enough to diagnose OCD. Obsession refers to an uncontrollable frequent mental image, thought, unwanted desire that cause uncomfortable condition to the patients. The patient is not able to stop thoughts such as fear of air pollution, harming others or oneself, and expression of natural/sexual immoral desires. OCD is the fourth most common psychological disorder and is also a clinical challenge. In recent years, several medical and psychological treatments have been conducted to treat the disorder (Sadok & Sadok, 2007). Behavioral approach and other effective ways to encounter and prevent OCD responses are the first treatment options that help controlling the symptoms to a great extent. Nevertheless, the notable achievement regarding treatment of the disorder is undeniable, there are still cases that have no or negligible response to the treatment. However, there are patients who cannot approbate encountering methods and don't execute homework or the tasks (Sookman & Steketee, 2010). Although CBT is successful in treating OCD, many researches have been conducted to find out other methods with more efficiency (Rees & Vankoesveld, 2008). One of these approaches is time perspective therapy, that is rooted in social psychology and it is extending to clinical and psychological fields. It has to do with the way that people connect their behavior with the past, present and future and at the same time mirroring viewpoints, beliefs, and values pertinent to time. It also takes time as a quasi-trait structure constituted of several aspects including past positive, past negative, present fatalist, and present hedonist, and the future. Time perspective therapy (TPT) is a novel treatment method based on time perspective theory (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). In general, psychological engagement with any time frames or loss of attention to a time framework appears to have to do with abnormal performance. As the theory implies, over past negative orientation, psychological engagement with negative experience, present fatalist orientation, or future negative are the strong indicators of psychological problems (Beek, Berghuis, Kerkhof & Beekman, 2011). Boyd and Zimbardo (2005) made it clear that treatment or a healthy psychological performance is achieved by maintaining balance between the past, present, and the future. This balance might be a reflection of an individual's capabilities to learn from the past, compatibility with the present, and preparing to encounter with orientated behaviors for the future. There is a pool of information of using time perspective theory in many heath facilities; while there is paucity of clinical psychology and psychotherapy studies. The first work on the role of time perspective on committing suicide was carried out by Laghi, Baiocco, D'Alessio & Gurrieri (2009). Beek, Berghuis, Kerkhof and Beekman (2011) examined the relationship between time perspective, personality, and psychological pathology and concluded that subjects with higher past negative scores were more vulnerable to stress and psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. In addition, they found a relationship between lack of orientation to future in time perspective and depression/suicide thoughts. Furthermore, positive relationship was found between neurosis and past negative perspective. Zimbardo, Sword and Sword (2012) codified a 6-session treatment protocol based on TPT to reduce PTSD symptoms. …",

In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

      "title": "Burnout",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a psychological reaction to unmanaged chronic workplace stress that occurs across three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. High rates of burnout have been observed in a wide range of professions, including healthcare and teaching; burnout has also been observed in unpaid work such as caregiving and parenting. Burnout is associated with reduced work performance and poor self-image, in addition to adverse mental and physical health outcomes ranging from major depressive disorder to type 2 diabetes. Burnout may influence health outcomes primarily via changes in health behaviors, such as increased alcohol consumption, but some evidence suggests that burnout can impact health independently of health behaviors. While the physiological underpinnings of burnout remain poorly understood, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and changes in DNA methylation patterns may be involved. Various interventions to reduce or prevent burnout have been tested; while mindfulness- and exercise-based interventions appear promising, results have been inconsistent. Further prospective research using higher-quality designs is needed to improve the scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of burnout.",

      "title": "Euthymic suffering and wisdom psychology",
      "abstract": "In Fava and Guidi's paper1, euthymia is defined by \"lack of mood disturbances that can be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics\" , \"positive affects\" and \"psychological well-being\" . So, good mood is euthymic. But, what about bad mood and suffering which can also not be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics? Life is no rose garden. All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is a clear lack of consensus regarding definitions and nosology in somatoform syndromes, and this is obvious with a cursory review of the clinical literature. Outside of the clinical context, the use of such terms as hysteria, somatization, somatoform disorders, functional somatic syndromes, and medically unexplained symptoms is even more bewildering for patients and nonmedical personnel. Typically, a diagnosis is a descriptive label used to convey information about the nature and cause of a syndrome, disorder, or disease. A good diagnosis not only should convey descriptive information but also should communicate information about prognosis and treatment/management possibilities. In thinking about diagnoses and how they ideally work, an oversimplified example using the common medical diagnosis of hypertension is instructive. Hypertension is chronically elevated blood pressure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures above certain levels (measured in millimeters of mercury) are considered indications of high blood pressure. Provided that a diagnosis of hypertension is arrived at through well-recognized methods, various forms of treatment or management are indicated. These might include the use of antihypertensive medication, dietary changes, exercise, and/or lifestyle alterations, or a combination of these treatments. While there are doubtless debates about subtleties of determining at-risk levels, methods of measurement, and therapeutic approaches, the basics of a diagnosis of hypertension seem clear.",

      "abstract": "Juvenile bipolar disorder (JBD) poses a clinical conundrum, both diagnostically and therapeutically. In part, this could be ascribed to the developmentally-insensitive diagnostic criteria of our current classificatory systems, fairly common atypicality of presentations in this population, mixed psychotic ultra-rapid cycling course, high rates of comorbidities, and overall less-than-optimal response to medications [1]. Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BSD), or Cade’s disease, stipulates a history of a depressive episode with ‘red flags’ that draw the clinicians’ attention to the possibility of underlying bipolarity for what clinically manifests as ‘pseudounipolar’ depression [2]. These are depicted in Table 1. And conceivably, this is of paramount importance with prognostic and therapeutic implications as antidepressants use in such cases could destabilize mood, induce manic shifts and/or accelerate cyclicity [3]. Hypergraphia, or graphorrhea, has been tied to organicity, e.g. interictal personality and stroke but also reported in schizophrenia and mania, where the patient has a compulsive tendency to write at a length. Mungas defined hypergraphia as a tendency to excessive writing that goes beyond any social, occupational, or educational requirements. This needs to be differentiated from organic automatic writing behaviour where writing perseveration without elaboration is evident [4-7].",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

More than any other, the general practitioner has always been noted for the consideration given to the feelings and personality of the sick. That his efforts in this field have met with a large measure of success is demonstrated by the loyalty of his patients. There has been evidence of an increasing desire to learn more about psychiatry and its contribution to medical practice, but when a general practitioner or internist turns to any of the older textbooks written by a psychiatrist, he may fail to secure the help he needs. He will find a lengthy discussion of major mental disorders and relatively little attention given to minor mental and emotional factors. For the average practitioner a psychosis occurs only in an exceptional case. He",

These events range from extreme high magnitude stressors such as torture, terror attacks, rape, childhood sexual abuse, natural disasters, or war to more commonly experienced stressors such as the loss of a romantic relationship, persistent physical illness, or business difficulties. Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder share the same traumatic stressor criteria involving \"exposure to a threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation\" and include direct experiencing, witnessing, or learning about a stressor.",

It is characterized by disturbances in perception, emotional regulation and thought processes, including symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading to a disconnection from reality. Patients often suffer when trying to meet the demands of ordinary life. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in development of psychosis. Besides these, there are also environmental influences, which contribute as a trigger and later progression of psychotic disorders. These external determinants could possibly be managed in attempts to contain the problem of increased mental health conditions with the main psychotic component. This article reviews the literature reports of current environmental risk factors of psychosis.

Mental trauma or psychological injury has been underdiagnosed as a basis for litigation, and attorneys often overlook the need to screen accident victims and family members. Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

This may be, in part, due to the fact that there is neither a uniform definition nor do they constitute an indication of regulatory and commercial interest. Nevertheless, they do have a decisive impact on the long- term course of bipolar disorder, and the degree of functionality and quality of life is more likely determined by their presence or absence than by acute episodes. Summarizing the literature an estimated 20-50% of patients suffer inter-episodically or chronically from subsyndromal bipolar disorder. The most prominent symptoms that interfere with functionality are subsyndromal depression, disturbances of sleep and perceived cognitive impairment, whereas anxiety negatively impacts on quality of life. In the absence of evidence based pharmacological treatments for subsyndromal bipolar disorder, clinical practice adopts guidelines designed for treatment-resistant full-blown episodes of bipolar disorder, supplemented by cognitive-behavioural, family focused or social-rhythm based psychotherapies.",

If evidence of psychiatric disease arises during the medical examination, an additional expert advice should be obtained to differentiate between mild or reversible dysfunctions and severe or chronifying psychiatric diseases.

      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

      "title": "Interim report: Development and evaluation of a three-week inpatient fatigue management education protocol for persons with MS-related fatigue",
      "abstract": "Background\r\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) reported by patients (between 50% and 92%; Krupp 2006, Weiland et al. 2015). The Multiple Sclerosis Council (1998) defines fatigue as “a subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities”. Fatigue limits the ability to participate in everyday activities, work, leisure and social participation and is considered to be one of the main causes of impaired quality of life among persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) independent from depression or disability (Jackson et al. 1991). \r\nPrimary fatigue refers to fatigue in absence of an apparent cause and it is specific of MS whereas secondary fatigue is a consequence of other concomitant conditions (e.g. psychological disturbances, musculoskeletal problems, sleep disorders and medication side effects), which may be related to MS but also to other diseases. The pathophysiology of primary fatigue in MS is highly complex and, so far, not completely understood. To date, the best therapeutic approach seems to be a multidisciplinary management involving exercise therapy, self-management and education in conjunction with medication (Rottoli et al., 2016, Kos et al., 2016). \r\nTwo meta-analyses provide moderate to strong evidence for fatigue management education (or energy management education) based on energy conservation strategies and cognitive behavioural therapy to reduce the impact of fatigue on occupational performance and quality of life (Asano et al., 2014, Blikman et al., 2013). The treatment protocols used in these clinical trials (Vanage et al. 2003, Sauter et al. 2008, Mathiowetz et al. 2005, Finlayson et al. 2011, Hugos et al. 2010, Kos et al. 2007) are all based on the 6-week group-based program developed by Packer et al. (1995), carried out in outpatient setting and delivered by trained occupational therapists. The typical features of this program are stable groups with 6-12 participants, hierarchical construction of the issues, 4-6 group sessions (±2h x week, total 12 hours) and homework between the group sessions to apply the energy conservation strategies and to implement a behavioural change. At the moment the evidence for in inpatient settings (Wendebourg et al. 2016, Van Kessel K. et al., 2008) or individual treatments (Kos et al., 2016) with the same issues are inconclusive due to the small sample size. \r\nDespite good evidence for fatigue management education programs, their limited external validity has prevented the implementation of these treatment protocols in Switzerland and other European countries. They are currently not available for pwMS in these countries. The main reasons are the absence of locally specialized OTs and no translated and culturally adapted treatment programs as well as a miss match between the organisational needs of the regional healthcare organizations and the treatment protocols. In Switzerland multidisciplinary rehabilitation for pwMS is delivered mostly in specialized rehabilitation centres, where pwMS spend three to four weeks as inpatients yearly or biennially. During the rest of the year, pwMS maintain their normal busy life which often includes (part-time) paid and/or family work. At best, they receive physiotherapy in the meantime, but they have no access to specialized OTs due to time, energy and availability constraints. \r\nUntil now, no program has focused on treating inpatients in dynamic group compositions over a shorter period (three weeks) but with higher frequency and has allowed participants to stream into the group continuously whenever being admitted which is necessary for successful implementation in the rehabilitation context. Information is missing whether such treatment characteristics are feasible in the inpatient setting and how these would be perceived by pwMS.\r\nProject aims \r\nThe project is divided into two distinct parts. \r\nThe aim of Part 1 was the development of an evidence based energy management education (EME) treatment protocol in German and a training concept in using EME for occupational therapists, followed by a test run with 10-15 pwMS and 3 OTs, evaluation of the experiences and optimization of the treatment protocol and the training protocol of OTs. Additionally, a feasibility study for the evaluation of the efficacy of EME was prepared.\r\nThe aim of Part 2 is to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for EME in terms of processes, procedures, resource management and scientific metrics by a pilot-run with 40 pwMS. \r\nAfter the validation of the treatment protocol low-threshold courses for occupational therapist will be provided to facilitate a broad implementation so as to assure the availability for many pwMS.\r\nProject partners and finances\r\nThis project is a cooperation of the Stiftung Kliniken Valens with the Rehabilitation Research Laboratory 2rLab of the University of Applied Sciences (SUPSI) in Manno. Part 1 was partly financed by the Swiss Occupational Therapy Association and the “Stiftung Ergotherapie Zurich”. Part 2 is partly financed by the Swiss MS-Association. The execution of this project is enabled by SUPSI and Kliniken Valens.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is an affective disorder of emotional expression characterized by frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying. It is usually associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological conditions. This disorder can present a challenge to clinicians to distinguish this from mood disorders or to diagnose this disorder in the context of underlying mood disorders. In addition, the delay in the diagnosis can impact patients' quality of life. We describe a 48-year-old man who presented with frequent episodes of sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughing two years after his recurrent stroke. The patient initially had his first stroke about three years ago and had a recurrent stroke eight months after his first stroke. A few days after getting discharged after his second stroke, the patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit after his family members reported aggressive behavior. The patient also reported symptoms of depression and was discharged on escitalopram for mood and divalproex for his aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with these medications with no resolution of his symptoms. The patient was then treated with dextromethorphan-quinidine, escitalopram, and divalproex, resulting in significant improvement in his mood and aggressive behavior with a resolution of uncontrollable laughing spells. Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders. Appropriate management of this condition can help improve patients' symptoms and positively affect their wellbeing.",

      "title": "Differentiating Depression From Demoralization in Organ Transplantation Recipients",
      "abstract": "Living with end stage organ failure and transplantation has implications for physiological, psychological, and social well-being. The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

Mass psychogenic illness typically affects adolescents or children, groups under stress and females disproportionately more than males. Symptoms often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case. They can spread rapidly by apparent visual transmission, may be aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response, and frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other and removed from the environment in which the outbreak began. Physicians should consider this diagnosis when faced with a cluster of unexplained acute illness.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "title": "\"Bipolar Family\"",
      "abstract": "Sir: When depression is preceded by a history of manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode, classifying it as bipolar depression rather than unipolar depression becomes straightforward. However, when there is no access to such history and the initial presentation is from the depressive end of the pole, correctly classifying the disorder as bipolar rather than unipolar then becomes difficult. Being able to correctly classify depression as bipolar rather than unipolar is crucial due to the ramifications of the diagnosis in terms of management. For example, it has been recommended that the depressive period of uncomplicated bipolar disorder should be treated for shorter periods than that for unipolar depression.1 Whereas in unipolar depression antidepressant monotherapy may be appropriate, in bipolar depression, without coupling it with a mood stabilizer, it may precipitate a “manic switch” and create a state of chronic irritable dysphoria and possibly a long-term rapid-cycling course.\r\n\r\nDue to symptomatic similarity between the 2 diagnostic entities, no particular symptom invariably distinguishes between the 2 disorders. However, if residents, psychiatrists, and family physicians can maintain a high index of suspicion, then certain factors from the past or present history would indicate that the depressive episode is more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar. We describe the mnemonic “Bipolar Family” to remind clinicians of factors or symptom clusters that would make a depressive episode more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\n“Bipolar Family”: Factors That Make a Depressive Episode More Likely To Be Bipolar Rather Than Unipolara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the significant difference in treatment3 and despite the similarity in presentation, we hope that residents, psychiatrists, and primary care clinicians will utilize this mnemonic as a screening tool when faced with a patient who primarily presents with a depressive episode.",

Patients complain of pain described as burning, associated with sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor and/or trophic disorders. The pain appears disproportionate to the initial lesion. The diagnosis is purely clinical and based on the Budapest criteria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood and is thought to be multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been described: an inflammatory state, an overactivation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and a poor perception of pain at the central level. The management of signs and symptoms is therefore global. It involves physiotherapy and occupational therapy, often combined with analgesic medications. Psychological treatment may be proposed in certain circumstances. The natural evolution is rather favourable.Le syndrome douloureux régional complexe constitue une entité clinique survenant habituellement suite à un traumatisme, une chirurgie ou un autre événement déclencheur.

Curiously enough, compared with other functional symptomatology, somehow this disturbance has been neglected in literature until now. Urologists, surgeons, and internists have more difficulties than psychiatrists to find out that distinct emotional conflicts and especially unsatisfactory sexual adjustment might have contributed to the development of recurrent or chronic urinary retention which they vainly tried to explain by organic findings. Of course the fact that extensive medical evaluations or even surgical procedures revealed no abnormality except the stout urinary bladder never is suifficient to qualify for \"hysterical disease\". Every diagnosis has to be established on positive grounds. Hypothetic explanations of mysterious syndromes by supposing more \"microscopic\" and thus undetected morphological deficiencies and changes as the crucial cause of a disease never should become the protective trick by which a physician avoids confrontation with his patients' psychological problems.",

Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

      "title": "Chronic pain, psychopathology, and DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder.",
      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

The influence on immune functioning is more likely lateralized with left cerebral involvement than right-sided involvement. Depression, along with the accompanying neuroimmune changes, is found more frequently after left cerebral lesions than after right-sided lesions. Stress, particularly uncontrollable stress, produces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunction as measured by elevations in plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone. These changes parallel those seen in many depressed patients. But caution is called for in assessing stress and depression. In everyday life, as opposed to the laboratory, the controllable versus uncontrollable paradigm is not as useful. Attitudes, spiritual resources, hopes, and ideals can neutralize the effects of an uncontrollable stress situation, such as prisoners of war and victims of religious or ethnic persecution might experience. Whether subjective differences in tolerance for such uncontrollable stresses are accompanied by distinguishing indicators of neuroimmune dysfunction has yet to be demonstrated.",

Diastolic pressure will remain high over periods of stress with such persecutors, but it is not clear whether other physical mechanisms are necessary for the development of sustained and of deteriorating hypertension. It is generally assumed that they are necessary. However, two situations are developed in this paper, where sustained and deteriorating hypertension seems to be determined by unconscious mental images, one of an alarming situation, and the other of an internalised driving parent, determining both hectic behaviour and hypertension. To some extent both complexes yielded to psychotherapy with considerable relief in the pressor state, and in one case with radical behaviour change.",

However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person. The data are drawn from a qualitative study of 57 chronically ill persons with varied diagnoses.",

      "title": "Depression and Mania in Patients with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Depression has a major impact on quality of life in patients with epilepsy and is also the main risk factor for the increased suicide rate in epilepsy. The frequency of depressive disorders depends on the severity of epilepsy and the localization of the epileptogenic focus, with a prevalence of ≤50% in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of depression in epilepsy may be difficult because symptoms of depression may be fluctuating, and some symptoms, such as memory complaints, may be misinterpreted as being a consequence of drug treatment or the epilepsy per se. Affective disorders in epilepsy may differ from those seen in patients without epilepsy. A possibility exists that patients with epilepsy will develop a specific interictal dysphoric syndrome related to limbic system dysfunction. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest a bidirectional relation between depression and epilepsy. Depression does not necessarily occur after the onset of epilepsy; the sequence may as well be the other way round, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for both disorders. Classic bipolar disorder type I is rarely seen in epilepsy, and manic episodes occur almost exclusively in the setting of postictal psychosis or after epilepsy surgery. This article explores the clinical manifestations of depressive and manic disorders in epilepsy and the differences from bipolar disorder.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

      "title": "The spectrum of mood disorders.",
      "abstract": "The problem of classifying mood disorders still lacks an acceptable solution. Interrater reliability studies have shown that this problem is more prevalent in mood disorders compared with other psychiatric conditions. Historically the problem originates from the distinction between Geisteskrankheiten and Gemütskrankheiten (mental and mood disorders) because the domain covered by the word mood has been progressively reduced. The fact that neurotic disorders are \"emotional disorders\" further complicates this field. The words anxiety and depression refer to a disorder, to a symptom, and to everyday feelings. A failure or difficulty in the distinction between these three meanings leads to nosological confusion. In recent years, the notion of a spectrum of mood disorders has gained acceptance. According to this, the diverse disorders are placed on a point that is more or less close to one of the extremes. Something similar occurs in the unipolar-bipolar distinction, in which the bipolar II or atypical and bipolar III occupy a central place on the spectrum. Cluster analysis and other mathematical techniques have helped to clarify the outlook, but there is a need for a biopsychosocial perspective and for a deeper understanding of the natural history of these disorders.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Burnout in Bahamian Health Care Personnel",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: For many in the healthcare industry, feelings of exhaustion and low satisfaction with work are commonplace. Thirty years ago, the term “burnout” was coined to describe this state of frustration and fatigue among health and service workers, which arose from excessive demands on their resources.1 Burnout syndrome has primarily been described as a multidimensional process with three central constructs: Emotional Exhaustion or “EE” (feeling emotionally drained and exhausted by one's work), Depersonalization or “DP” (negative or very detached feelings toward clients or patients), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment or “PA” (evaluating oneself negatively and feeling dissatisfied with positive job performance and achievements).2 Burnout is different from stress in that while stress is acute, burnout tends to be chronic and is exacerbated by an accumulation of emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job.2 Burnout is relevant for both healthcare personnel as well as for the patients they serve as it has been associated with negative consequences for both groups.3,4 Burnout can result in decreased morale and increased physician turnover, as well as poor judgment in patient care decision making, increased medical errors, diminished dedication, decreased quality of care, and reduced patient safety all of which can have consequences. It is important for the culture of medicine, for healthcare workers, and for patients, that burnout be identified in practice and its symptoms alleviated. Physicians and healthcare workers are able to provide a higher standard of care when their work satisfaction is high.4 The burden of burnout in healthcare providers is significant. In fact, in the United States, burnout is more common among physicians than any other type of US worker.5 The prevalence of burnout in US physicians was reported at 45.8% in 2011 where physicians reported at least one symptom of burnout and rose to 54% in 2014.5 Its prevalence has been found to range from 17% to 52% in UK physicians6 and 9% to 82% in Middle-Eastern physicians. In all three groups the burnout symptom most commonly reported was EE. While mental well-being has been investigated among Caribbean physicians, burnout has not been studied in this group. Burnout has also been found to affect medical students and residents.7,8 Healthcare personnel (HCP) in the Bahamas were queried to assess the burden of burnout in this group. A convenience sample of HCPs who attended a Scientific Conference at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in the Bahamas was surveyed. In this cross-sectional survey the study population consisted of attending/private practice physicians, resident physicians, and medical students, all of whom practice and train in the Bahamas. The study tool used was the Abbreviated Maslach Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel,8 which participants completed prior to entering the conference. The Abbreviated Maslach Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel measures the three dimensions of burnout—Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Low Personal Accomplishment. For each item, participants were asked to respond, “Every day,” “A few times a week,” “Once a week,” “A few times a month,” “Once a month or less,” “A few times a year,” or “Never.” Each item was scored with a number ranging from 0 to 6; 6 being “Every Day” and 0 being “Never.” It consists of an abbreviated 9 items taken from the original 22, the latter being a gold standard, validated, survey. Sixty-six surveys were returned, some of which had incomplete sections of either PA, DP, or EE. Fifty four respondents answered all of the Personal Accomplishment items, 51 respondents answered all of the Depersonalization items, and 58 respondents answered all of the Emotional Exhaustion items. Most of the respondents were women (49/66; 75%), 41% were attending/private practice physicians and the remainder were resident physicians (16/66; 24%) and medical students (35%; 23/66). Of the three dimensions of burnout, emotional exhaustion was the only one reported as being experienced and it was only reported among resident physicians and medical students. Medical students and residents were significantly more likely to report this dimension. No symptoms of burnout were reported by attending/private practice physicians. In addition, healthcare workers aged 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 reported feelings of burnout in this dimension (emotional exhaustion), while those over the age of 40 did not report burnout in any dimension. Women were also significantly less likely than men to report burnout in the dimension of depersonalization. Neither attending/private practice physicians, resident physicians, nor medical students reported feelings of burnout in the dimensions of depersonalization or personal accomplishment. In summary, Bahamian medical students and resident physicians report burnout symptoms in the dimension of emotional exhaustion, to a significant degree, while practicing physicians did not report experiencing burnout in any dimension. This finding that burnout in the dimension of emotional exhaustion decreases with increased age may be partially explained by the fact that older physicians who are either attendings or private physicians, are able to set their own hours, while resident physicians and medical students are studying and working under unrestricted hours. It could also suggest that Bahamian medical professionals tend to learn how best to cope with their work environment over time through increased feelings of self-efficacy and increased resilience. Those who struggled more and did not experience this change over time may have exited the medical field entirely. A study conducted by Ey et al9 in 2013 found that 87% of residents who were aware of a Resident Wellness Program addressing burdens like burnout would be willing to seek help through the program. In order to promote physician well-being, leaders within organizations, including medical schools, residency programs, hospitals, and healthcare systems have to play a large role.10 Residents and fellows are looking to physician leaders for counseling regarding how to avoid as well as cope with distress in training.8 If burnout is identified and counseling made available, as well as provision of an environment that “cultivates well-being,”10 residents and medical students will benefit in the short term, and will also likely acquire some of the necessary tools to combat burnout throughout their careers. This convenience sample sheds some light on the burden of burnout in this setting. A more rigorous study design using the validated 22-item Maslach survey and securing a larger sample size may allow an improved understanding of burnout in this setting. However, it may be prudent to consider strategies to alleviate burnout and build resilience among medical students and resident physicians in the Bahamas. Importantly, burnout prevention methods must be explored, trialed, and implemented as well.

      "abstract": "Summary Human sexuality is a complex interaction of biological, social and emotional factors. When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by a normal organization of cardiac structure, normal or enhanced cardiac function, and a relatively normal pattern of cardiac gene expression; whereas pathological hypertrophy is associated with an altered pattern of cardiac gene expression, fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and increased morbidity and mortality. An unresolved question in cardiac biology has been whether distinct signaling pathways are responsible for the development of pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy. Recent studies have suggested that some signaling pathways play unique roles in the regulation of pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, inhibiting pathological cardiac growth while stimulating physiological growth could have therapeutic value in the setting of heart disease.",

There is as yet little empirical research on the validity of the diagnosis. Literature on disasters, civilian and wartime, and on more ordinary stressful life events does not support the view that extreme stressors form a discrete class of stressors in terms of the probability of psychiatric sequelae or the distinctive nature of subsequent psychopathology. Extraordinary stressors are like more ordinary stressful events with respect to their complex differential effects upon individuals. Personal characteristics and the nature of the social environment modify the likelihood and form of the response of individuals to all types of stressors.",

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

A disease with a strictly defined biological aetiology, a condition with an established psychopathological image and neurophysiological pathomechanisms, a condition qualitatively distinct from health or, rather, a complex reaction to broadly defined stress, accumulation of negative emotions and weakening of the body’s vitality? The aim of the paper is to present the latest medical views on depression, with emphasising the difference between a depressive disorder and sadness. Two perspectives are taken into account – that of the patient and that of the doctor.",

      "abstract": "Seizure recurrence in epilepsy poses the patient at risk of self-harm and can have a negative impact on his/her personal and social life.For this reason, the disease, when suspected, should be promptly diagnosed and treated.Unfortunately, this is not the case for several patients.2][3][4] A delay in the diagnosis of epilepsy may occur preferably when the first seizures are focal or, if generalized, they present with inhibitory features or only mild motor signs.In those cases, the patient might seek medical advice even after several years. 2 Along with seizure type, diagnostic delay can be explained by other factors, including patient's own poor awareness of the nature of his/her symptoms, doctor's misdiagnosis, and, not least, the rarity of some events and their modest impact on patient's daily life.However, seizure recurrence with strong impact on one's health and quality of life cannot be excluded even after mild events, particularly in untreated patients, and one cannot exclude that future seizures have a greater impact on patient's and public safety.For these reasons, Laura Parviainen and co-workers 5 are commended for having addressed this issue in the intent to verify the impact of diagnostic delay on seizure outcome in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy.The authors examined 176 adult patients who were eligible for inclusion in randomized trials of antiseizure medications.The choice of that sample was motivated by the accuracy of the medical records with specific reference to the history of seizures while untreated.Patients were followed for five years, and seizure recurrence was noted and classified in three categories: (1) Complete seizure freedom after treatment start; (2) Seizure freedom achieved after treatment changes; (3) No seizure freedom despite medication changes.The authors found that",

Affects, moods or emotions are psycho-physiological states which tend to augment or decrease pathophysiological states. 2. The interaction of pharmacological agents with certain affects or emotions may be synergistic or antagonistic. 3. A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "abstract": "Delicate diagnosis':avoiding harms in difficult, disputed, and desired diagnoses Life & TimesMedical diagnoses can be subject to ambiguity, flux, subjectivity, and inherent uncertainty.This is particularly true in primary care, where many reported symptoms do not conform to a clear diagnosis.Thresholds around normality are often unclear.Symptoms are commonly experienced and described as an 'iceberg'.Over a third of otherwise well people without a chronic condition have felt tired or run down, or had a headache in the previous 2 weeks, and over a quarter have had back or joint pain.Distinguishing conditions that would benefit from diagnosis and earlier intervention from those that are temporary, self-limiting, and prone to harmful medicalisation, remains challenging.While overdiagnosis is a diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognised, would not cause symptoms or harm, contested diagnoses are symptoms given a diagnosis, but where the diagnosis, as an explanation for them, is controversial.Opponents consider contested diagnoses 'wrong' not because of an error in history taking, clinical examination, or interpretation of a test result (which would risk misdiagnosis), but because the diagnosis itself, for example, chronic Lyme disease or multiple chemical sensitivity, is invalid.Contested diagnosis is bordered by 'pseudoscience', for example, adrenal fatigue, leaky gut syndrome, and chronic candidiasis, which attempt to explain symptoms with 'science' that is demonstrably incorrect.Many contested diagnoses relate to symptoms that are not clear-cut, meaning that some people are given a diagnosis that does not confer benefit.Others are primarily unexplained 'yet'.For example, Gulf War syndrome was treated as a contested illness but is now recognised as caused by exposure to sarin gas.Other recognised conditions are prone to a variety of influences such that diagnosis risks causing harm, through a variable mixture of misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, pseudoscience, or overtreatment.A framework for considering some conditions as 'delicate diagnoses' may help to recognise and reduce the harms of medicine in these circumstances.",

Disease is often used to name all the conditions that cause pain, dysfunction (whether physical or psychological), social and other problems, and seafarers are part of a particularly risky group to undergo certain illnesses due to difficult and very stressful work, uneven working hours and other of the overwhelming circumstances of life on board because of which the immune system as well as mental health inevitably suffers.",

      "title": "The complex conundrum of geriatric depression and dementias",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

      "title": "Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) delirium: A “psychosomatic” problem?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication after major surgery and related among other potential medical precipitants to either pre-existing cognitive impairment or the intensity and length of anesthesiology or the type of surgery. Nevertheless, in some rare situations, an organic etiology is not always found, which can be frustrating for the medical team. Some clinicians working in an intensive care unit have a reluctance to seek another hypothesis in the psychological field. Method: To illustrate this, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed a massive delirium during her intensive care unit stay after being operated on for a left retroperitoneal sarcoma. Interestingly, she had had no previous cognitive disorders and a somatic explanation for her psychiatric disorder could not been found. Just before the surgery, she was grieving the recent loss of a colleague of the same age, and also a close friend, and therefore had a death anxiety. Results: With this case report, we would like to point out the importance of psychological factors that might precipitate delirium in a predominately somatic environment such as an intensive care unit. Significance of results: ICU delirium can sometimes be considered as a “psychosomatic” problem with either a stress response syndrome after surgery or a defense mechanism against death anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of such psychological factors even if they always must first rule out potential somatic causes for delirium and encourage thorough investigation and treatment of these medical causes. A collaboration with the psycho-oncologist is recommended to better manage this “psychosomatic” problem.",

It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy.

Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia.

It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

PBA exacts a severe burden on the patient and care-givers in terms of reduced social functioning and often results in the patient’s isolation. The pathophysiology of PBA is incompletely understood, but symptoms are thought to result from damage to neural pathways associated with motor functioning and emotional processing. Data suggest that PBA is under-recognised by neurologists and psychiatrists and many cases go unrecognised or misdiagnosed. PBA has been successfully treated with psychoactive drugs, including antidepressants, but these do not have regulatory approval for use in this indication. A combination of dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulphate (DM/Q) has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing PBA symptoms and a favourable safety profile in a series of clinical trials and in regular clinical use. With the availability of an effective treatment for PBA symptoms, it becomes even more pressing to detect the condition so that patients can receive appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Hysteria is regarded as a symptom of emotional disturbance and mental disorder that is common among adolescent girls. It often occurs in schools during classes. Hysteria often begins with one student and subsequently spreads to other students, as many as 20-50 at one time. Its bizarre symptoms include sudden shouting, struggling, crying for no reason, talking unintelligibly and body paralysis. Previous research on hysteria by psychologists, psychiatrists and physicians from an alternative Islamic approach has identified many factors that cause hysteria. Hysteria may be related to cultural factors or to individual values and beliefs. Psychologists believe that the main factor in hysteria is emotional stress experienced by the patient. The hysterical reaction is one way for these patients to release emotional stress. Teenagers who suffer from uncontrolled stress may express themselves through hysteria. Psychiatrists suggest that hysteria may occur as a result of extreme emotional stress arising from long, unresolved and unexpressed emotional conflicts. In 2008 and 2009, hysteria occurred frequently among adolescent students in Malaysia and involved students in both boarding schools and day schools. This is an alarming situation for schools and parents because this phenomenon has an effect on the learning process and a psychological impact on students. Therefore, this study examined the phenomenon of hysteria to identify its factors, symptoms and treatment. The respondents included 41 girls who experienced hysteria at one school in Selangor, Malaysia. This study was conducted with questionnaires and interviews. Hysteria can be caused by psychological factors, psychiatric disorders and the cultural and religious factors. Common symptoms of hysteria include difficulty sleeping, aches and pains, extreme anxiety, hallucinations and nightmares. Hysteria can have a psychological effect on adolescents who experience it. Therefore, ways of managing hysteria must be identified, especially from a psychological perspective.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a serious and chronic mood disorder, which in extreme forms can lead to psychosis, especially in manic states. In this sense, historically, the differentiation from schizophrenia has represented a real clinical challenge and a nosological dilemma. Categorical diagnostic approaches have promoted progress in the generation of consensus and the facilitation of scientific communication, but many times, they have done so to the detriment of the complexity and richness of clinical presentations. As a counterpart, the notion of the bipolar spectrum proposes a dimensional perspective, a continuum of severity in whose maximum expression alterations in the content of thought or sensory perception can stand out. Schizotype, where these manifestations can be found, has long been pointed out as a series of personality characteristics linked to schizophrenia. But its presence can be verified in other areas of psychopathology, even outside it. Regarding its presence in mood disorders, schizotypal traits, instead of being a marker of a worse prognosis, could be related to positive aspects such as creativity. The objective of this work is to investigate, through a bibliographic review, the association between schizotypy and bipolar disorder, mainly its possible role in the creative processes associated with this pathology.",

Those mood swings are largely the result of hormonal changes and the physical process of recovery after childbirth. The relationship between the mother and her family members, the doctor, and the nurses, as well as their experiences together, are of great importance during pregnancy, giving birth and afterwards. Except for those factors and other risks, which can cause postnatal psychological changes, there are other conditions for postnatal depression to emerge, such as the characteristics of the mothers in terms of dealing with stressful situations, as well as their history of mental illnesses. Psychological changes after giving birth, mood disorders, are manifested in several ways: from the usual mild reactions of sadness, which spontaneously disappear in a few days, to difficult and severe disorders, which require a specialist’s intervention and often the hospitalisation of the mother. In those grave cases, the distorted perception of their child and surroundings can result in the mother harming herself or her child.\r\n Preventing serious troubles, helping the mother after childbirth, as well as recognizing the symptoms and reducing the risks of postnatal distress are responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Trained through education and courses, house visits, clinical examinations before, during and after birth, those primary and secondary medical care professionals continuously participate in the postnatal care of women. It is not only important to insure the healthcare for the mother and child’s physical wellbeing, but also taking care of their emotional needs.\r\n This paper aims to analyse some of the risk factors and prevention of postnatal depression and psychosis, and their connection.\r\n The results of the study performed have shown partial uniformity with other studies. 37% of the women questioned have experienced postnatal sadness and 16% have experienced postnatal depression. However, it has been found that 3% of the female testimonies have shown a postnatal psychosis. Of all the symptoms, the women questioned have selected “feeling tired” and “lack of energy” to the greatest extent. The smallest number have selected recurring “suicidal thoughts” and “thoughts of death”. The results suggest the presence of light and temporary mood swings, but also show a small amount of severe problems, which can be identified as disorders.",

      "abstract": "Medical staff is exposed to a complex of adverse occupational factors of physical, chemical, and biological nature, high severity and intensity of the labor process. Unsatisfactory working conditions are associated with health risks for medical personnel and can lead to occupational and work-related diseases. The most often occupational diseases detected in medical staff are infectious ones. In the context of the spread of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), the probability of infection of the medical personnel themselves with possible damage to organs and body systems with a subsequent disability is high. The article pays considerable attention to the high level of neuro-emotional stress, the problem of burnout, accompanying the work of medical personnel, especially in extreme conditions, which include epidemics and pandemics, in particular the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of burnout syndrome (BS) among medical personnel in many countries has reached crisis proportions, exceeding the level of any other occupational group. Despite a significant number of studies related to the study of BS in medical personnel, there are still difficulties with its diagnosis, primarily associated with the subjectivity of the methods used; there is little scientific evidence about the clinical manifestations of BS, its symptoms. The study of the phenomenon of emotional burnout, its prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation is relevant in connection with the direct relationship of BS not only to maintaining the health, mental stability, and professional longevity of specialists involved in long-term interpersonal communication but also to the preservation of the patients’ health. It is necessary to discuss making additions to the list of occupational diseases and to the list of harmful and dangerous industrial factors and works in which preliminary and periodic medical examinations are carried out, concerning medical staff whose working conditions are associated with the high nervous and emotional stress, in particular during work in extreme conditions.",

      "abstract": "Among the cases in my note-books I find quite a considerable number where injuries, especially falls, producing quite severe blows upon the back alone, upon the head, or upon the back and head together, have been the apparent cause of grave symptoms, involving the mind or the general nervous system, or both.I find that the gravity of the resulting disease does not depend upon the severity of the primary injury, nor upon the intensity of the pain and other indications of mischief immediately following.The character of the disorder, whether spinal, cerebral, or general, has not in these cases depended upon the locality of the original disturbance, whether of the head or of the back.Of two cases of delusional mental disease, one, which re- sulted in recovery, was, I think, the direct outcome of a fall in a skating-rink, whereby the back of the head received a sharp blow not causing even momentary unconsciousness.The second was slowly developed through slight mental confusion, irritability, hardly dis- tinguishable change of character, suspicion, jealousy, and fear of personal injury into delusional mental dis- ease, remaining now, in the fifth year, an incurable insanity, which originated in a succession of violent blows to the back, but no injury to the head, from falling down stairs.A large number of cases of epilepsy and a few cases of general paralysis of the insane were thought, to have been the direct consequence of blows or other injuries, for the most part of the head, but to a less extent of the back.Chorea, too, aud the group of symptoms classed under the head of spinal irritation, neuras- thenia, and now and then hebephrenia, had their origin",

      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), characterises illness anxiety disorder (IAD) as the preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness in the absence of somatic symptoms (or, if present, symptoms that are only mild in severity). DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

The accommodative power of the blood pressure becomes unsteady, as demonstrated by its irregular fluctuation. Therefore, an investigation into the complicated mechanism of the origin of high blood pressure in persons of presenile age is justified.

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

From a biological viewpoint, chronic fear and activation of glucocorticoids are metabolically costly. The physiological effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may elicit posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological characteristics of which may be in the opposite direction to those of TBI. Somatic injury occurring in the concussive accident may be the most important consideration affecting status and outcome. Chronic stress impairs the process of wound healing, attributable to proinflammatory. Stress reduces the immune response, and reduces the proliferation and activity of various types of cells. Prolonged somatic activity related to injury, stress, pain; stress reactions to chronic pain and impairment; and unhappiness all result in neuroendocrine imbalances. Physiological dysfunctions contribute to neurobehavioral dysfunctioning that can be misattributed to cerebral injury, faking or secondary gain, if the practitioner does not consider the effects of an injury.",

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability. (7), (8) Anxiety symptoms may predict progressing physical disability among older women and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living over 1 year. …",

The patient may appear tired, self-concerned, bored, and inattentive and display a loss of interest in the surroundings. Anxiety is a conspicuous and an integral element of affective state and may be expressed by severe restlessness and agitation. Muscle tension, wringing of hands, weeping and moaning, repeating over and over in a monotonous and stereotyped way phrases expressive of misery are all important clinical signs of major depression. Similarly tachycardia, dry tongue/mouth, sweaty palms and/or bodily extremities, cold clammy skin, pallor, pupillary dilatation, tremor, and the fluctuations in blood pressure with wide pulse pressure are all important and give away the underlying distress. These signs have formed an integral part of both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale as they have a positive correlation with the diagnosis and the severity of illness. Current practice of operational criteria does not help exclude patients with subjective perception of distress and also fails to make room for aetiopathogenesis. The DSM-IV does not include these physical signs as an integral part of the clinical picture of depression, consequently leaving the diagnosis of MDE to subjective criteria and perceptions. This could also explain a large placebo response in recent randomised controlled clinical trials.",

Severe depressive states (e.g. major depressive episodes) are less common than minor depressive states.

Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress. Depressive symptoms in survivors are associated with impaired physical function, other psychiatric morbidity, cognitive and work difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life.

The second part of the chapter has focused on three specific neurological entities to examine evidence for a possible association between neurological illness and life stress. There is some suggestion that certain vulnerable epileptic patients can experience convulsions in response to acute emotional upheaval or certain types of cognitive challenges. More commonly, it is probable that social stress and emotional tension can produce lowering of seizure threshold by increasing levels of fatigue and disrupting sleep. The latter factor, in particular, is known to lower seizure threshold. In the case of stroke, several dramatic cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been related to disastrous life circumstances. A general association between life stress and stroke has yet to be established. The case for a link between life events and onset of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis seems stronger. Events which produce emotional upset seem capable of worsening symptoms in patients with existing disease, and several studies have reported unusual life stresses in the period preceding onset of symptoms in this disorder.",

Problems in differential diagnosis arise because symptoms resembling angina may result from disease or abnormal function of the brain, skeletal system, gastrointestinal system, or structures in the bony thorax or within the thoracic cage. The most difficult problems in differential diagnosis arise from psychoneurosis and gallbladder disease. Careful history taking will resolve the problem in most instances, prolonged observation will settle the question in others.

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Systematic and detailed psychopathological examination of 400 consecutive primary major depressives failed to confirm common clinical stereotypes which ascribe greater somatisation, hypochondriasis, agitation, psychotic tendencies, and chronicity to old age. Those above 65 were more likely to suffer from single episodes of depression that were often precipitated, whereas subjects whose illness began earlier were more likely to express depression as part of a recurrent unipolar or bipolar disorder, with higher rates of affective temperamental pathology and familial affective illness. The acute clinical picture was relatively uniform in older and younger depressives and, taken together with the other findings, tends to favour a spectrum model of primary mood disorders.",

Some research data indicate that cyclothymic disorder and temperamental disorders may be considered as mild forms of bipolar disorders so called \"subaffective disorders\".

These are generated by treatment and rehabilitation measures, pensions and loss of working hours. The cause of pain is multifocal and frequently remains unclear. It is not the etiology of back pain that has changed in the last 20 years, but its rate of assessment and treatment options. According to the relevant literature, treatment of chronic back pain will most probably only succeed using multimodal concepts that have to consider medical/somatic and psychosocial aspects and be based on scientific training experience. Pain assessment is based on common legal and certification standards. However, typical decision and rating problems result from the difficulty of objective medical registration and grading of pain. Medical certification may often be complicated by co-morbidities such as somatic pain attacks, fibromyalgia, depression or anxiety. These cases necessitate close cooperation with other medical specialities.",

Essential features offunctionaldyspepsia include persistent pain or discomfort above the umbilicus, not associated with or relieved by a change of stool frequency or form, as well as a lack of evidence for inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic conditions. In about 50 % of adults and greater than 70 % of children, the pathophysiology of symptoms of functional dyspepsia is related to abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal motor function, such as delayed gastric and small intestinal transit, decreased gastric accommodation, and gastric dysrhythmia. Diagnostic evaluation should be driven by an index of clinical suspicion based on pertinent red flags in the history and physical examination. A comprehensive treatment approach uses the biopsychosocial model, which involves a combination of educational, pharmacological, psychological, as well as complementary therapies. Determining the patient's most distressing symptom may also help to target particular treatment options and individualize therapy. Follow-up of dyspeptic patients at 6 months to 2 years revealed that 70 % of subjects were either asymptomatic or much improved regardless of the cause; however, the remainder had neither improvement nor worsening of their symptoms despite aggressive medical management.",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa. The impact of early childhood events in particular may have the long-lasting effects,especially if epigenetic changes are involved.",

The description of personality disorders has been complicated over the years by undue adherence to overlapping and unvalidated categories that represent specifi c characteristics rather than the core components of personality disorder. Many people with personality disorder remain undetected in clinical practice and might be given treatments that are ineff ective or harmful as a result.

The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations.

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

Such a development poses a problem in bioethics. If the development can be foreseen, the problem may be forestalled.

      "title": "Psychosocial Aspects of Sudden Death",
      "abstract": "Meaningful information was available on 26 patients who died suddenly in a 44,000 industrial population. The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "title": "Stress, stigmatization and psychosomatic purpuras.",
      "abstract": "Stress is a term that is readily recognized by everyone but defines rigorous scientific definition. It is widely interpreted as the emotional and biologic responses to novel or threatening situations. In humans, however, the term \"distress\" seems to be preferable, more clearly defining the fact that is the response that is being referred to, rather than the stimulus. Distress has been postulated to be capable of precipitating an overt illness, as when it occurs coincidentally with an incipient infection or neoplasm. Moreover, it is able to provoke several disorders and symptoms in many tissues and organs, including the skin. In this paper the authors focus on the main characteristics of stress and emphasize the relevance of psychosomatic medicine that proposes the simultaneous examination of psyche and soma. Special consideration is given to a peculiar form of skin disease, psychogenic purpura, together with the stigmata of mystics that, in large part, seem to be conditioned or provoked (or provocable) by emotional stress or by psychic influences on cutaneous fibrinolytic activity.",

      "abstract": "We here review Babylonian descriptions of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, psychoses, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, psychopathic behaviour, depression and anxiety. Most of these accounts date from the first Babylonian dynasty of the first half of the second millennium BC, within a millennium and a half of the origin of writing. The Babylonians were remarkably acute and objective observers of medical disorders and human behaviour. Their detailed descriptions are surprisingly similar to modern 19th and 20th century AD textbook accounts, with the exception of subjective thoughts and feelings which are more modern fields of enquiry. They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery. The Babylonians were the first to describe the clinical foundations of neurology and psychiatry. We discuss these accounts in relation to subsequent and more modern clinical descriptions.",

Por otro lado, el riesgo de aparicion de depresion en edades avanzadas puede aumentar ante la frecuente restriccion de actividades y el aislamiento social, los impedimentos en la movilidad, asi como por el impacto creciente de enfermedades medicas, sobre todo de origen cardiovascular, vascular-cerebrales y neurodegenerativas. Existe, por lo tanto, una relacion de causalidad bidireccional entre la salud fisica y la mental.

Es logico, de acuerdo con lo expuesto anteriormente, que intervenciones basadas en el estilo de vida esten demostrando utilidad en la prevencion y el tratamiento de los trastornos mentales. Por ejemplo, la practica regular de ejercicio fisico, una dieta sana y equilibrada como la que ofrece el patron mediterraneo, una correcta higiene de sueno y la exposicion moderada a la luz solar pueden ser herramientas importantes en el abordaje de los sintomas depresivos en la poblacion mayor, ademas de mejorar su salud fisica. catalaL’augment de l’esperanca de vida ha generat un creixent interes per l’estudi de la qualitat de vida de les persones grans.

Functional dyspepsia has been subclassified into different subgroups based on the dominant symptom. A diagnosis of functional dyspepsia can be further categorized into several disorders. Once a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia is made, confident reassurance by the clinician is essential to manage patients with functional dyspepsia and may obviate the need for medication therapy in many patients.",

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are reported to be among the most prevalent and unfavourable mental disorders in the individuals who have gone through life-threatening situations. For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

      "abstract": "The medical profession's focus on dealing with negative mental states has led to the suggestion of classifying 'happiness' as a major affective disorder (pleasant type).To describe the symptoms and signs of happiness and discuss its health benefits.Epidemiological data suggests that happiness is related to personality factors such as high self esteem, feelings of personal control and extroversion and is unrelated to demographic factors or the ownership of consumer goods. Humour is a communication device specifically designed to elicit joy and happiness and is effective in relieving anxiety and stress and enhances communication in medical settings. Recapturing the optimistic enchantment with life that is a part of childhood may be a key to happiness and health.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is a personal experience which makes it difficult to define and measure. It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

This article examines the evidence for yet another claimed effect of boredom and monotony, viz., that these factors are stressors, and that because they are stressors, they may produce effects even more detrimental than those mentioned above. Both laboratory and field studies are examined for evidence of increased neuroendocrine activity during exposure to conditions determined to be, or generally acknowledged to be, boring or monotonous. It is concluded that the available data offer no support for the belief that boredom or monotony per se produces the syndrome of stress. However, monotony coupled with a need to maintain high levels of alertness could represent a combination capable of eliciting considerable stress.",

The stress of returning to work at the beginning of the week has been postulated as a possible trigger factor. This project examined the weekly variation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of nontraumatic origin for the entire case series as well as for selected subgroups. A retrospective analysis of 1,498 incidences between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1996 revealed a distinct Monday peak in occurrence irrespective of age, gender, presence of witnesses, primary survival, or primary ECG. This finding, however, was most pronounced in retired patients, subjects living alone, and persons found unconscious outside buildings or in public places. One important trigger of cardiac arrest is going to work after weekends; however, resumption of social and other activities on Mondays is another possible trigger. Other factors, such as endogenous biological rhythms, may contribute to an increased risk at this particular time even in elderly.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

It does not work very well for most mental health problems, as these are based on common sensations and perceptions that most of people experience from time to time. It is apparent that the various symptoms that make up the diagnostic categories of mental disorders are distributed widely and variously across the population. The biomedical model considers that pathophysiological changes are the basis on which to consider and characterize the presence of a pathological process. Disease categories should only be regarded as valid if they can be shown to be discrete entities with natural boundaries that separate them from other disorders. Even more uncertain are the boundaries between anxiety, depression and somatization in primary care. Mental health disorders may be \"valid\" but not useful in clinical practice.",

Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one.

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

The onset of illness or chronic disease may have a significant impact on how and when a woman engages in sexual activity. Adolescence is a time of great physiological, emotional and psychological change. It is a time of exploration, emancipation, and a search for self-identity. For couples who want to continue sexual intimacy throughout pregnancy, the physician may recommend positional changes that are more comfortable for the woman and can accommodate the enlarging fetus. Pain, or the anticipation of experiencing pain, may have a negative effect on the woman's interest in sexual intimacy. Women in midlife, aged 40 to 65, can use guidance regarding the impact of chronic illness, hormonal changes, and medications on sexual functioning. Common sexual consequences of dementia include anhedonia, depression, impotence, incontinence, and anorgasmia.",

      "abstract": "In this paper I explore health and illness through the lens of enactivism, which is understood and developed as a bodily-based worldly-engaged phenomenology. Various health theories - biomedical, ability-based, biopsychosocial - are introduced and scrutinized from the point of view of enactivism and phenomenology. Health is ultimately argued to consist in a central world-disclosing aspect of what is called existential feelings, experienced by way of transparency and ease in carrying out important life projects. Health, in such a phenomenologically enacted understanding, is an important and in many cases necessary part of leading a good life. Illness, on the other hand, by such a phenomenological view, consist in finding oneself at mercy of unhomelike existential feelings, such as bodily pains, nausea, extreme unmotivated tiredness, depression, chronic anxiety and delusion, which make it harder and, in some cases, impossible to flourish. In illness suffering the lived body hurts, resists, or, in other ways, alienates the activities of the ill person.",

Crucially, there is no explanatory physical cause that can be demonstrated. The man or woman so afflicted reports that they cannot raise their arm, or cannot see; yet physical investigations prove negative and, when sedated or observed unobtrusively over time, symptomatic inconsistencies arise. However, despite these, the diagnostic systems applied are quite specific that the patient experiencing and exhibiting such symptoms and signs is not responsible for their production, i.e. they are not ‘feigning’. Hence, the physician is called upon to judge what the patient is thinking and not doing, i.e. to perceive that they are really trying to move or see and are not pretending to be impaired. This is a complex task and the use of language in this area suggests considerable uncertainty among physicians as to what it is they are diagnosing.",

Although there are no approved pharmacologic treatments specific to post-traumatic headache, emerging strategies focus on treatment paradigms similar to migraine management. Failure to address post-traumatic headache and post-traumatic migraine will lead to prolonged post-concussive symptoms and the misunderstanding that such prolonged symptoms are a result of incomplete recovery from concussion.",

Addressing the underlying thyroid condition typically proves highly effective in rectifying the associated brain disorder.

Moreover, thyroid hormones have demonstrated potential in expediting or augmenting the effects of standard mood disorder treatments in euthyroid patients, hinting at a baseline state of localized cerebral hypothyroidism with an uncertain pathogenesis, potentially remediable through high doses of thyroid hormones.",

      "abstract": "Psychosomatic disorders in children and adolescents is a topic that covers a wide variety of illnesses and one which is difficult if not impossible to define accurately. In general, chronic emotional states, often nonspecific, serve as strong contributors to the development of a physical illness. The particular illness is often dictated by varying degrees of biological predisposition in one physiological system—i.e., such a predisposition in the respiratory system may lead to asthma or in the gastrointestinal system to ulcerative colitis. In some cases the biological factor is large and the emotional factor minimal, while in other cases the reverse is true. In the early days of research in psychosomatic disorders it was widely believed that each disorder was accompanied by certain specific emotional problems. Further study has shown this is not true. It was also felt that many, if not most of these disorders could be cured by psychotherapy, and this also has proven to be a fallacy. We have moved more and more to the team approach. Since both psyche and soma are involved, more than one specialist is usually required. In children and adolescents this may involve a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician, an allergist or gastroenterologist, a social worker and a psychologist. It requires time and patience to form an effective and smoothly functioning team in which all members respect one another's potential contribution. Some examples of team operation are presented and some of the problems outlined. In addition, there is attention given to the special problems of the adolescent and also the child with chronic nonspecific physical complaints as well as the child who requires hospitalization.",

The symptoms and clinical course of this condition are apparently uniform, but there is no agreement as to its classification. Ladame<sup>1</sup>and Redalié<sup>2</sup>stated that the disorder is based on clinicopathologic findings which they classed as specific, while Scheidegger<sup>3</sup>and Jahn and Greving<sup>4</sup>expressed the belief that it is a syndrome and complication of various psychoses, usually schizophrenia. Stauder<sup>5</sup>expressed the opinion that it is a definite disease unit because it usually occurs in hereditarily tainted persons with constitutional vasomotor instability who are otherwise physically and mentally normal. <h3>CLINICAL FEATURES</h3> The onset is abrupt; the duration is brief, usually from several days to a few weeks, and the outcome is always fatal. The symptoms are both mental and physical, the latter",

The other type may be called depressive disease; a synonym that might be used is unipolar psychosis; here only depressive episodes are seen (one or more episodes). In addition to the difference in the clinical picture, considerable genetic data exist which indicate that the two illnesses are quite distinct from each other.",

Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

Depressive symptoms are a collection of behaviors and feelings that can be specifically classified as depression. Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

The disorders are caused by physical and/or psycho-social circumstances. In treating the different forms of stress disorders, physical activity has been utilised with good results.

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "title": "Bipolar depression: the clinical characteristics and unmet needs of a complex disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed important clinical aspects of bipolar depression, a progressive psychiatric condition that is commonly treated in primary care. Bipolar depression is associated with considerable burden of illness, high suicide risk, and greater morbidity and mortality than bipolar mania.Methods: We identified articles relevant to our narrative review using a multistep search of the literature and applying terms that were relevant to bipolar depression or bipolar disorder.Results: Bipolar depression accounts for the majority of time spent unwell for patients with bipolar disorder; high rates of morbidity and mortality arise from full symptomatic episodes and interepisode subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar depression is an important contributor to long-term dysfunction for patients with bipolar disorder due to psychosocial impairment, loss of work productivity and high rates of substance abuse. Missed and delayed diagnosis is prevalent due to overlapping symptoms with unipolar depression and other diagnoses. Medical comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome) and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are common. Currently, only three treatments are FDA-approved for bipolar depression; monotherapy antidepressants are not a recommended treatment option.Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is common among primary care patients presenting with depression; it is often treated exclusively in primary care. Clinicians should be alert for symptoms of bipolar disorder in undiagnosed patients, know what symptoms probabilistically suggest bipolar versus unipolar depression, have expertise in providing ongoing treatment to diagnosed patients, and be knowledgeable about managing common medication-related side effects and comorbidities. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical.",

It then becomes necessary to determine whether this symptom is indeed secondary to some other problem of a situational, developmental, or psychiatric nature, or whether any associated emotional distress is secondary to study difficulties deriving from poor study habits. In this paper a pragmatic distinction has been made between Primary Study Difficulty and Secondary Study Difficulty, and between various subcategories of the latter. Useful as such a classification may be it remains, like most classifications, somewhat arbitrary and artificial. In any given case it is usually possible to relate a student's presenting complaints to a variety of factors, and to discern a subtle intertwining of cognitive and emotional determinants. The diagnostic and remedial needs of students with such problems are therefore best served by a clinic which involves psychiatrists and psychologists working in close collaboration.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is a fear of scrutiny by other people in social or performance situations. The level of anxiety experienced by the person with social anxiety disorder is excessive, and results in substantial impairment in the sufferer's social, family, and professional life. Three distinct subtypes of the disorder have been identified: generalized social anxiety disorder, in which the individual fears a multitude of social situations; nongeneralized social anxiety disorder, in which only 2 or 3 situations are feared; and public-speaking phobia. Results from a number of studies suggest that these subtypes of social anxiety disorder may represent distinct clinical syndromes, with the generalized subtype producing the most severe disability. Despite the prevalence of social anxiety disorder and the disability it causes, this condition remains underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated, by clinicians. This review discusses the barriers that prevent people who have this disorder from seeking help, and the steps that clinicians can take to aid their recognition and treatment of the disorder. It is only by effective diagnosis and treatment that the burden of social anxiety disorder will be lifted, allowing patients to resume a normal life.",

Patients with a high degree of medical comorbidity often require inpatient management for evaluation and monitoring of initial treatment. Determining whether a \"depressive\" symptom is best attributed to depression or to an underlying medical condition is particularly challenging. Depression is highly prevalent in patients with neurological illnesses such as cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Psychiatric presentation of depression and psychiatric comorbidity often necessitate inpatient management. Depression with active suicidality, severe anorexia, or presence of psychosis in depressed patients are common indications for hospitalization. Comorbid alcohol or other substance abuse or history of bipolar disorder requires intensive monitoring and treatment. Assessment of suicidality is a frequent reason for psychiatric consultation. An algorithm for suicide assessment is provided. Other clinical factors to consider when deciding whether to hospitalize include presence of agitation and comorbid cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Traditional views of pain as either directly associated with physical pathology or psychologically based [psychogenic or motivational] have proven to be inadequate. A range of psychological variables and concepts have been shown to play important roles in pain perception, maintenance and exacerbation of pain, disability, and response to treatment. The role of operant conditioning [learning] and cognitive factors [i.e., beliefs, perceptions of control, coping strategies] on the maintenance and exacerbation of pain and disability are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the effects of psychological factors on behavioral responses and physiological activity associated with pain. It is suggested that rather than viewing the pain experience as either organically-based or psychologically-based that both of these factors need to be viewed as contributors to the perception and response to pain.",

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of a severe mental illness and a substance use or abuse disorder is common in the United States as well as internationally and could be considered as more the expectation than the exception when assessing patients with serious mental illness. Substance use disorders can occur at any phase of the mental illness, perhaps even inducing psychosis. Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities and poor health, poor self-care, increased suicide risk or aggression, increased sexual behavior, and possible incarceration. All of these factors contribute to a greater health burden, which reduces the health care system's capacity to adequately treat patients. Therefore, screening, assessment, and integrated treatment plans for dual diagnosis that can address both the addiction disorder and the mental illness are recommended in order to provide accurate treatment, after-care, and other health care to accommodate patients' social and vocational needs.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Interviewing the patient to get a clear description of the complaints may involve a physician in the psychotic thinking of the patient.

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm dysfunction has recently been suggested to have a causal role in major depressive disorders. Against this background, experiments on circadian rhythms are outlined that yield a state of sustained sleepless activity. Such states can be brought about it seems by manipulation of the external zeitgebers to which rhythms are synchronized rather than by any alteration of the circadian clock. This can be expected to yield a disorganized rhythmic state rather than any discrete phase shifting or desynchronization of rhythms. This state it is suggested should lead to a mild dysphoria, psychomotor activation and a subtle disordering of thought form. It is proposed that these changes lead to the typical clinical picture of mania when distorted cognitively by mechanisms similar to those found in depression. There are a number of implications of this hypothesis. Firstly, mania should commonly be precipitated by similar psychosocial factors to those which precipitate depression. Secondly, similar neuroendocrine findings should be found in both depression and mania. Thirdly, similar agents should be effective in the treatment of mania and depression. Fourthly, cognitive therapy may play a significant part in the management of acute episodes of mania and reduce liability to chronicity.",

What makes depression in the elderly so insidious is that neither the victim nor the health care provider may recognize its symptoms in the context of the multiple physical problems of many elderly people. Depressed mood, the typical signature of depression, may be less prominent than other depressive symptoms such as loss of appetite, sleeplessness, anergia, and loss of interest in, and enjoyment of, the normal pursuits of life. There is a wide spectrum of depressive symptoms as well as types of available therapies.

The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person's lifetime. Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient's physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked. Exploring the patient's articular features in her clinical context led us to diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome, a complex and often ignored condition. The case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach and coordinated interventions to define and manage this clinical entity.",

Since specific studies have yielded a relatively large numbers of cases in the past, it can be concluded that the disorder is probably more prevalent than is suggested in the literature. These cases may well be not only primary types, based on mental or unclear causes, but also secondary types, mediated by aberrant somatosensory sensations. Treatment of the underlying condition (in most cases a psychotic or mood disorder) has proved to be increasingly successful over time.Because of the possible co-occurrence of zoanthropy and alterations in coenesthesis, i.e. the sensation of physical existence, mental health workers should be on the lookout for cases of clinical zoanthropy in clinical practice and avoid treating them in the same way as they would treat other delusions. All cases that occur should be subjected to extra somatic investigations – including an EEG and neuroimaging – and treatment should be adjusted in accordance with the findings.",

Body dysmorphic disorder is an increasingly recognized somatoform disorder, clinically distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and depression. Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with an imagined deficit in the appearance of one or more body parts, causing clinically significant stress, impairment, and dysfunction. The preoccupation is not explained by any other psychiatric disorder. Patients present to family physicians for primary care reasons and aesthetic or cosmetic procedures. Cosmetic correction of perceived physical deficits is rarely an effective treatment. Pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and non-pharmacologic treatment with cognitive behavior therapy are effective. Body dysmorphic disorder is not uncommon, but is often misdiagnosed. Recognition and treatment are important because this disorder can lead to disability, depression, and suicide. Psychiatric social work assessment and intervention was provided to the person with Body dysmorphic disorder, focusing on to building for change in misbelieve and strengthening commitment to change. The psycho social intervention was provided to the patients and his family members. Sessions on Admission counseling, Family intervention, Supportive therapy, Psycho education, role play, reminiscence, Pre discharge counseling, Discharge Counseling and Social Group Work was conducted. At the end of the therapy, the client knowledge about the illness and coping skills has improved.",

Sleep deprivation has a significant impact on the optimal functioning of the immune system. Fibromyalgia is a rheumatoid syndrome of unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain and generalized muscular tenderness. An intimate link between pain, mood, and sleep is apparent. Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a condition of unknown etiology characterized by fatigue that persists for more than 6 months and presents with several of the following symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, pharyngitis, tender lymph nodes, non-restorative sleep, and malaise after physical exertion that extends beyond 24 hour.",

      "abstract": "It has been known that psychological factors are one cause of dizziness. We report a patient with dizziness with specific psychological causes. The patient was a 26-year-old woman who had previously been examined at several hospitals for a complaint of dizziness. A detailed examination at our hospital revealed no organic or functional abnormalities. She participated in group psychotherapy on the supposition that her dizziness had strong psychological causes, but communication with the doctor and other patients was difficult and psychotherapy had no effect. We then introduced a clinical psychotherapist, who said the patient had a borderline personality disorder. The patient become hostile to treatment when administration of drugs either by drip infusion or orally was also ineffective, making further treatment virtually impossible. Mistakes in the care of patients with borderline personality disorders can aggravate the symptoms or even lead to self-mutilation or suicidal behavior. Moreover, commonly used simple psychological tests do not always detect this disorder. Consequently, accurate diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder is difficult for the otorhinolaryngologist. If this disorder is suspected, the best course for the otorhinolar-yngologist is to introduce a specialist in psychiatric diagnosis at an early stage.",

      "title": "Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

Although any region of the head may be affected, the parietal area is the common localization of nummular headache. The pain remains confined to the same symptomatic area which does not change in shape or size with time. The pain is continuous but lancinating exacerbations lasting for several seconds or gradually increasing from 10 mins to 2 h may superimpose the baseline pain. The temporal pattern is either chronic or remitting. Pseudoremissions may be observed when the pain reaches a very low grade or only discomfort (not pain) in the affected area is reported. At times, discomfort may prevail. Either during symptomatic periods or interictally, the affected area may show a variable combination of hypoethesia, dysesthesia, paresthesia or tenderness. Physical and supplementary examinations are normal. Nummular headache emerges as a primary clear-cut clinical picture. The particular topography and signs of sensory dysfunction make it reasonable to vent the idea that nummular headache is an extracranial headache, probably stemming from epicranial tissues such as terminal branches of sensitive nerves. Nummular headache may seem to be the paradigm of epicranias (group of headaches and pericranial neuralgias stemming from epicranial tissues). Nummular headache must be distinguished from head pain secondary to local processes and from tender points of more extensive headaches. Although nummular headache may frequently coexist with other primary headaches, it has an independent course. Treatment is seldom necessary and in most cases simple reassurance is sufficient.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines fear as \"the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat\" and anxiety as \"anticipation of future threat.\" Fear typically induces surges of autonomic arousal and thoughts of immediate danger and escape, whereas anxiety typically manifests as muscular tension and avoidant behaviors.

Due to their relevance, these associated disorders will be discussed briefly in this chapter. Relevant changes to anxiety disorders in the DSM-5 are outlined in Table 1. Of note, the DSM-5 requires a minimum of 6-month duration of symptoms that are not attributable to another medical condition and mental disorder or induced by a substance or medication to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. An exception is noted in symptom duration for children with separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism, with a required duration of 4 weeks and 1 month, respectively. Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been unlinked in the DSM-5, and panic attacks can now be listed as a specifier, applicable to all DSM-5 disorders [1]. Many anxiety disorders develop in early childhood and typically persist into adulthood if not adequately treated. These disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety in magnitude of reaction and/or persistence beyond developmentally appropriate periods. A thorough grasp of a proper differential diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders can be daunting; however, it may be easier to conceptualize various anxiety disorders from the perspective of the developmental spectrum, using age of onset to help guide a differential [1, 3].",

Of note, the DSM-5 requires a minimum of 6-month duration of symptoms that are not attributable to another medical condition and mental disorder or induced by a substance or medication to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. An exception is noted in symptom duration for children with separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism, with a required duration of 4 weeks and 1 month, respectively. Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been unlinked in the DSM-5, and panic attacks can now be listed as a specifier, applicable to all DSM-5 disorders [1]. Many anxiety disorders develop in early childhood and typically persist into adulthood if not adequately treated. These disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety in magnitude of reaction and/or persistence beyond developmentally appropriate periods. A thorough grasp of a proper differential diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders can be daunting; however, it may be easier to conceptualize various anxiety disorders from the perspective of the developmental spectrum, using age of onset to help guide a differential [1, 3].",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

A slowing of thought and movement to the point of severe retardation or even stupor may occur. Anxiety is often present and in agitated depression is accompanied by restless psychomotor activity. As lesions in the hypothalamus may produce disturbances in appetite, weight, libido and sleep, it has been suggested that hypothalamic dysfunction may play a part in the aetiology of those depressions in which physical symptoms predominate (Pollitt, 1965).",

      "title": "Hypochondriasis (Health Anxiety) Reformulated: Similarities With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in A Routine Setting Single Case",
      "abstract": "Despite its long documented history, Hypochondriasis remains a ubiquitous enigma to virtually all health care disciplines and providers. Because such highly health anxious patients are not commonly open to psychological (i.e., non-medical) interpretations of their physiological symptoms, sufferers ironically often become fixed on a pathological quest for physical and/or medical explanations for their problems. This pervasive worry and worry-based behavioral pattern perpetuates and reifies the belief that one hasor will developa serious medical condition, and, due to its inappropriate fixity on perceived organic (versus psychic) etiology, leaves such excessive doubt largely untreated. Therefore, continual high medical utilization and costs persist, and profound human suffering goes largely unchecked and unmanaged. Collectively, this sad, but very real condition and circumstance is unacceptable. Fortunately, this oft recalcitrant and thorny phenomenon has recently been construed as perhaps being similar to another such condition, namely Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If this resemblance is more than a surface relationship, and the two phenomena are indeed related on a process level (i.e., the two share a common pathological core), then Hypochondriasis should be treatable via a specifically tailored treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Since Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been far more responsive to intervention than Hypochondriasis, as its central mechanism of pathology is now well understood (i.e., intolerance for uncertainty), it would be conceivable that Hypochondriasis is in actuality far more treatable than its current riddle-status would otherwise suggest. Indeed, if the two prove to be quite similar, if not outright forms of one another, then there would be far more hope that patients who suffer with this can be helped. This stirring hypothesis was tested by treating a particularly refractory, chronic and severe case of Hypochondriasis with a specialized Generalized Anxiety Disorder treatment package. “Joe” responded quite favorably to treatment, and obtained meaningful change according to Jacobson and Truax’s (1991) method for determining clinically significantand reliablechange. In fact, according to their most restrictive standard, Joe could be labeled “Recovered” at the end of treatment, and at all 18-month follow-up points. His response, caveated around single case generalizability limitations, suggested that perhaps Hypochondriasis does indeed share a common etiological source, namely intolerance for uncertainty, with Generalized Anxiety Disorder; if so, then that would be highly explanative of the strong results. Recommendations are given for conceptualizing pathological forms of health-related fears as just that, a concrete form of an anxiety disorder rather than a Somatoform condition.

Many people, however, do not adhere to medical recommendations to exercise consistently, especially if they have chronic illnesses. Put forth to explain this conundrum are numerous potential explanatory factors. Among these are mental health correlates such as anxiety, fear, fatigue, pain, motivation, and depression, as well as various self-efficacy perceptions related to exercise behaviors, which may be important factors to identify and intervene upon in the context of promoting adherence to physical activity recommendations along with efforts to reduce the cumulative health and economic burden of exercise non-adherence among the chronically ill and those at risk for chronic illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a complex mental illness that is frequently both under-diagnosed and under-treated. The symptoms of bipolar disorder can be confused with other medical illnesses or drug effects or may even be overlooked entirely as extreme character traits. The consequences of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis are potentially devastating, including loss of employment, impaired relationships and a severely impaired quality of life. This article will review the historic perspectives of bipolar disorder, the diagnostic criteria for the phases of the illness, and the pharmacologic options available to treat this condition. Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, will be reviewed indepth. Based on extensive trial data, reviewed in this article, quetiapine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with other mood stabilizers for the treatment of acute manic episodes of bipolar I disorder. Clinical trials describing the efficacy of quetiapine in other phases of bipolar disorder and in other patient populations are also reviewed. A discussion of the drug profile of quetiapine includes its chemistry, availability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Preclinical studies, postmarketing surveillance, safety, tolerability and regulatory issues are also evaluated. Finally, potential future directions for quetiapine are discussed, together with a review of key issues in bipolar disorder management and details of the information resources used in preparing this article.",

      "title": "CURRENT TRENDS IN MILITARY NEUROPSYCHIATRY",
      "abstract": "In pursuing these policies of prevention and treatment, many difficulties remain. Perhaps the most outstanding is the widespread misconception regarding the whole subject of mental health in the mind not only of military personnel but of the civilian public, the family back home, and the public press. It is generally recognized that the concept of physical health covers a wide range of conditions ranging from a light head cold on down to terminal lobar pneumonia. Mental health, on the other hand, has been regarded as being black or white. Either a man was insane or he was completely normal. The possibility has not been considered that there might be anything in between. Actually, of course, mental health just as physical health ranges all the way from bad to good. A man may have minor temporary mental ill health just as he may have a head cold. Mental disorders may be acute or chronic, severe or mild; just as a man may have simultaneously a broken leg and the grippe he may have an acute anxiety neurosis superimposed on a psychopathic personality or an organic condition. A great deal of the confusion has arisen on the basis of terminology and semantics. Any word beginning with the letters \"psy,\" to the average mind, suggests something mysterious and alarming: insanity, perversion, homicidal tendencies. Many laymen become frightened and resentful when a psychiatrist applies a medical term to conditions they were used to recognizing as a \"case of the jitters\" or \"gone stale\" or \"nervousness.\" It is difficult for laymen to realize that when a case of the jitters is sufficiently serious to incapacitate a man or produce insomnia and indigestion, a psychiatrist may call it pstchoneurosis and yet not mean anything more serious than was meant by the layman who called it the jitters. Actually, of course, the problem extends further than this. The question arises whether present psychiatric terminology was designed to cover the entire range of mental health. Is it perhaps necessary to devise a new set of diagnostic terms to cover the range of acute transitory psychiatric disturbances which occur in \"normal\" individuals in reaction to abnormal stress? In conclusion, it may be said that the problems of mental health in this war have presented a major challenge to psychiatrists. To meet this challenge it was necessary to revise concepts and to approach problems with new viewpoints—it was necessary to shift attention from problems of the abnormal mind in normal times to problems of the normal mind in abnormal times.",

These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures. Both symptom-based and dimensional classifications can depict variable clinical pictures more accurately than diagnostic constructs but there are pragmatic issues such as suitability for brief appointments or emergency work.",

Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

People with social phobia have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of doing things that will embarrass them. This excessive anxiety usually leads to avoidance behavior that can severely affect normal daily living. SP usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. There is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. A number of studies have emphasized the high co-morbidity of social phobia with a number of other psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. Though clearly elevated there is much debate as to the nature of this relationship. Substance abuse may develop if people try to self-medicate their anxiety and make thamselves more comfortable in social situations. Anxiety may be a result of alcohol or drug abuse due to a substance's anxiogenic effects or through protracted withdrawal syndromes. Substance abusers incur more pathological and unstable life circumstances, making them more susceptible to future stress and anxiety; and there may be a genetic susceptibility in some people which makes them vulnerable to both disorders. The purpose of this article is to summarize research findings on SP and its complex relationship with substance use disorder. Clinical anxiety and substance abuse both warrant treatment and in all likelihood, each helps perpetuate the other.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa depresion es la enfermedad psiquiatrica mas frecuente en los pacientes de edad avan- zada. Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta. En este articulo se pretende revisar las posibles evolu- ciones y sus opciones terapeuticas, abordar si existe riesgo de encarnizamiento terapeutico, y finalizar con algunas cuestiones de la vida de estos pacientes que influyen en el afronta- miento de la enfermedad EnglishDepression is the most frequent psychia- tric illness in elderly patients. It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Depression has been conceptualized in two separate ways. Some define the phenomenon by a unique array of psychological abnormalities (a social and behavioural profile). On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

Se define el estrés y se clasifica desde diferentes perspectivas. El estrés es una causa de tensión y exigencia o mecanismo de adaptación.El estrés y la presentación del primer episodio depresivo están directamente relacionados, sin embargo cuando se presentan recurrencias el estrés significativo pierde fuerza dentro de los factores que lo desencadenan. Los estresores, especialmente los psicosociales, están relacionados con la presentación de recurrencias. Entre estos se destacan estresores internos y externos, por sucesos vitales, estrés de rol y las contrariedades cotidianas, la alta exigencia y el perfeccionismo. El no cumplimiento de metas es otro factor provocador de crisis en la transición del ciclo vital. El neuroticismo y el perfeccionismo, como actitudes disfuncionales provocan aislamiento y falta de soporte social. Los esquemas cognitivos disfuncionales conducen a un procesamiento erróneo de la información. La depresión es una pauta de relación que no permite encontrar formas adaptativas de enfrentar la vida y conducir las relaciones interpersonales. Aunque hay nuevas visiones que la consideran como un esfuerzo adaptativo. La comorbilidad puede hacer recurrir la depresión. Se ha sugerido que patrones maladaptativos cognitivos, en particular en interacción con estresores, podrían llevar a pobres resultados en el tratamiento de sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor en comorbilidad con trastornos de personalidad. Estos, independientemente del estado de la depresión, han sido asociados con elevadas actitudes disfuncionales.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "It has been a clinical case of a polimorphic psychotic disorder in a male of 26-year-old, affected by brain palsy, previously with adequate cognitive function, undergoing remarkable confusional fluctuations and a waking state apparently well-preserved. As possible comorbidities or triggers we could count on a tonsillitis and/or a depressive reaction a few days before. Serious consideration must be given to a differential diagnosis with an encephalitis but, despite the presence of an intermittent febricula, it was rejected by both units: internal medicine and neurology, after performing some complementary tests, albeit some more specific tests are still pending. His psychiatric background was also checked, which initially was orientated as a questionable bipolar disorder. At all events, symptoms stopped progressively until, almost complete remittance in the moment he was discharged from the hospital. He recovered his normal functionality. The treatment given was risperidon 2 mL/day, quetiapin 50 mg/8 h and baclofen 10 mg/12 h. This can be used as an example of how many difficulties we usually found to catalogue an acute disorder in first phases, even to encompass the clinical profile within the limits of psychiatry or neurology.

      "abstract": "Psychological distress is a driver both of direct and indirect health care costs. Depression compromises functional well-being, such as work productivity. Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

Conceiving of depression as a stand-alone diagnostic entity repeats the mistake of assuming a division between the mind and the body. Depression and anxiety frequently coexist, and generalized anxiety disorder may precede a major depression. Most mood disorders are dealt with at the level of primary care. The current understanding and clinical approach to them is dominated by a model derived from psychiatry, where there are significant differences in patient population and priorities from those in family practice. Family medicine has come under criticism for uncritically accepting this model and for failing to develop a model suitable for the family practice setting.",

      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

In the modern world any person is subject to the influence of stress, regardless of the age and gender differences, culture and social status. Stress is a non-specific reaction of the body to the extreme impact of various factors - stressors. As stressors can be: emotional, social, physical, informational and other factors. In functional and morphological terms, stress is manifests itself as a general adaptation syndrome which mobilizes the body’s resources in order to maintain homeostasis. Stress is characterized by staging. The early period of stress is manifested by transient anxiety, with a decrease in body resistance – it is the first stage of the adaptation syndrome. The second stage of stress is characterized by the functional tension of the body’s systems and adaptation to new conditions. In the case of prolonged stress, the body’s reaction becomes pathological, with the depletion of adaptive reserves and the failure of protective mechanisms. At this stage is increase a vulnerability to any stressors. There is a further violation of the consistency of vital functions, and persistent anxiety is formed. In overwhelming majority of cases, stress-induced anxiety is develop of psychovegetative syndrome. In the case when combined the strategies of coping (it is the second stage of the reaction to stress - the stage of resistance) with stress and if it is interrupted at an early stage, in such a way the somatic symptoms are also interrupted at the stage of autonomic dystonia syndrome. When the persistent stress is, we have a development of the third stage – exhaustion. And against the background of limited adaptive reactions, there is a psychosomatic pathology. The above determines the need for early detection of psychovegetative syndrome and its timely treatment. The optimal choice is the appointment of combined drugs for stress, which have anti-anxiety, sedative and hypnotic effects. The combination of phenobarbital and ethylbromisovalerinate is one of the highly effective and widely used for the relief of stressinduced anxiety and manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, reducing the risk of developing psychosomatic pathology.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from a force to the head and can cause acute physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics. Additional psychosocial treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and community engagement can also be helpful.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided.

      "title": "Postpartum Delirium: A Psychosis Born in the 18th Century",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "En el contexto de la salud el estrés está más presente, las manifestaciones como el agotamiento emocional, el distanciamiento afectivo y la depresión, entre otros como sus principales síntomas, aunque estos, muchas veces pasan inadvertidos hasta que llegan al estado crónico. Hoy en día los trastornos musculoesqueléticos son los problemas más comunes entre los profesionales de salud, generando un ausentismo laboral muy alto y pérdidas económicas a la institución de salud en donde laboran. Se realizó una exhaustiva revisión bibliográfica para examinar el impacto del estrés crónico en los trastornos musculoesqueléticos del profesional en el área de salud. Se consultaron bases de datos científicas como PubMed, Scopus y Web of Science, utilizando términos clave como \"estrés crónico\", \"trastornos musculoesqueléticos\", \"profesionales de la salud\" y \"salud ocupacional\". El estrés crónico en profesionales de la salud se ha revelado como un factor de riesgo significativo para el desarrollo de trastornos musculoesqueléticos. Las largas jornadas laborales, la alta demanda emocional y física, y la exposición constante a situaciones estresantes contribuyen a la tensión muscular, el dolor y la inflamación en diversas áreas del cuerpo.",

This complication may arise by variety of physiological and pharmacological factors during awakening from anesthesia. Excited delirium is a state of extreme mental and physiological excitement characterized by extreme agitation. We report a 15-year-old male patient with cannabis abuse, who was in emergence agitation or excited delirium after gastro-endoscopic procedure with propofol and ketamine sedation. In this case midazolam was not adequate and haloperidol was administered in order to diminish severe agitation. Emergence agitation may be related with cannabis abuse, and haloperidol may be the correct choice for treatment.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "title": "A Review on Depressive Disorders in Cancer Patients",
      "abstract": "Cancer turns from a terminal illness to more of a chronic illness. This perspective has broadened the scope of care from treating the disease alone to managing cancer-related symptoms including mental disorders. Among the nosological forms of comorbid mental pathology in cancer patients, affective disorders (depression and anxiety) predominate. While there is no evidence to support a causal role for depression in cancer, it may impact the course of the disease and a person's ability to participate in treatment. Depressive syndromes are highly correlated with a reduced quality of life, increased difficulty managing the course of disease, and earlier admission to inpatient or hospice care. The most common form of depressive symptomatology in people with cancer is an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, sometimes referred to as reactive depression which may be under-recognized and undertreated. More severe symptoms of depression are of clinical concern because of their association with marked distress, more prolonged hospital stays, physical disorders, poorer treatment compliance and adherence to therapy, disability, increased desire for hastened death and completed suicide. Suicidal statements may range from an off-hand comment resulting from frustration or disgust with a treatment course to a reflection of significant despair and an emergent situation. The diagnosis of depression is difficult due to the problems inherent in distinguishing biological or physical symptoms from symptoms of illness or toxic side effects of treatment. A critical part of cancer care is the recognition of the levels of depression present and determination of the appropriate level of intervention, ranging from brief counseling or support groups to medication and/or psychotherapy. At least one half of all people diagnosed with cancer will successfully adapt. Pharmacotherapy for depression in patients with advanced cancer should be guided by a focus on symptom reduction, irrespective of whether the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for major depression. The optimal antidepressant for specific patients can be determined by each patient's depressive symptom profile and potential dual benefit for depression and cancer-related symptoms such as anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, neuropathic pain and hot flashes. Because of both their adverse effect profiles and risk for lethality in overdose, tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A are rarely used in patients with cancer. Timely and precise diagnosis and appropriate treatment of depression is required in an effort not only to increase quality of life but also to reduce adverse effects on cancer course, length of hospital stay, treatment adherence and efficacy and possibly prognosis and survival.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

Harassment or sexual abuse leads also to a weak physical health. The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives. The girl was asked to draw all the members of her family. Interpretation of drawing when observed for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "The submitted paper is a preliminary trial of comparison between two illnesses: depression (or affective disorders) and epilepsy. Despite specific phenotypical differences determining the diagnostic and classification belongings there are a lot of similarities or common elements between both groups of disorders. Special stress was put on the bioelectrical background or phenomena accompanying epilepsy and depression. Current knowledge about biochemical and structural background of depression is wide and enough well recognized. In contrast, studies on bioelectric conditions of depressive disorders are quite poor, despite the fact that the bioelectric phenomena are--beside biochemical processes--the immanent feature of nervous cells. Currently--apart from the kindling phenomenon--there is a lack of theories or hypotheses trying to explain the origin of depression (affective disorders) with perturbation of bioelectrical functions in neurons. Certain bioelectrical phenomena accompanying the different forms of antidepressant therapy (e.g. changing in the threshold level) are recognized as accidental side effects or not possessing the clinical meaning. The analysis conducted shows a necessity of intensifying experimental and clinical investigations over explaining the usefulness of the electric phenomena in the pathomechanism of depressive disorders.",

It does allow the placement of a patient within a psychiatric diagnosis when they do not reach criteria for a major psychiatric nomenclature. To date, biological studies have not been reported. It is not known if AD with depression is closer to the biological characteristics of depression, or AD with anxiety would have similar characteristics to that seen with major anxiety. It is also not known if AD has a biological signature that would make them an entity with common features, or if they may be more closely allied biologically with the descriptor that accompanies them.

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream.

      "title": "Evaluating Adolescents With Fatigue",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Unexplained fatigue in adolescents is a common and frustrating complaint that can pose a challenge for even the most experienced physicians. Although the cause usually is benign and self-limited, occasionally there is a serious underlying disorder. This symptom cannot be dismissed without performing a thorough medical history, detailed psychosocial profile, and careful physical examination. Selective use of laboratory and radiologic studies should be considered when specifically indicated. If the cause remains unclear, sequential visits often provide clues for the practitioner and reassurance for the family. The purpose of this article is to offer guidelines to the clinician caring for adolescents who have prolonged, unexplained fatigue and to stress the value of a thorough history and physical examination.For purposes of this discussion, fatigue will be defined as abnormal exhaustion after usual activities. An arbitrary cutoff of 1 month is used to distinguish acute from chronic fatigue. The term chronic fatigue syndrome is avoided because criteria for this condition are not clearly established in children or adolescents, and data must be extrapolated from studies in adults. The term neurally mediated hypotension is used to describe a fall in blood pressure in response to assuming the upright posture, physical events, and emotional stressors. Affected patients may be syncopal or presyncopal. Neurally mediated hypotension also is referred to in the literature as neurocardiogenic syncope, vasovagal reflex, vasodepressor syncope, and autonomic dysfunction.The best way to approach a problem of this nature is to establish a good relationship with adolescents and their parents so they will trust your recommendations and not pressure you into unnecessary tests or referrals. The examination begins when the family enters the office by greeting the patient first to establish a direct relationship immediately. It is worthwhile to obtain the history while the patient is fully clothed because adolescents usually feel more relaxed under these circumstances. Initially, the patient and parents are interviewed together, assuring both parties that there will be adequate time later to speak with the examiner alone. While taking the history, the clinician should demonstrate a willingness to listen and be particularly alert for any clues of a hidden agenda or an underlying illness.More sensitive issues are discussed with the patient alone. Every effort must be made to assure privacy and confidentiality when obtaining personal information from adolescents. Credit must be give to Cohen, who has refined a method for organizing the psychosocial history that was developed by Berman in 1972. This system has been expanded and modified further at the SUNY Upstate Medical University Adolescent Medicine Center in Syracuse. The questions are structured in an easily remembered format that stresses the importance of connecting with adolescents HEADS FIRST (Table 1). This approach emphasizes that “getting into adolescent heads” is just as necessary as performing a physical examination. In many instances, the information obtained during the psychosocial interview is key to elucidating the cause of unexplained fatigue in teenagers.The issues outlined in Table 1 can be addressed with the traditional verbal approach, using the suggested cue words, or by having the patient complete a self-administered personal questionnaire. With either method, the questions should be answered privately and reviewed confidentially with the examiner unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. Most parents respect their adolescents’ need for privacy and appreciate the opportunity for them to receive one-on-one counseling with an experienced health professional.There is considerable overlap in the signs and symptoms caused by the various underlying conditions associated with fatigue. Manifestations are often subtle and should be correlated closely with the overall clinical picture. Thus, clinicians must have a high index of awareness when interpreting historical data, physical findings, and other pertinent information in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue.The onset, severity, and duration of the fatigue as well as any aggravating or relieving factors are explored when taking the history. Particular attention should be paid to any significant changes in the patient’s physical activity level, exercise tolerance, and ability to keep up with peers. Lack of sleep due to getting to bed later, difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakening, or getting up earlier in the morning should be considered. A careful review of systems is also essential, with close attention to any constitutional symptoms, such as unexplained fevers, chills, sweating, anorexia, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy, which may suggest the presence of an underlying infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory process. A history of an antecedent “mono-like” illness with negative diagnostic studies is relatively common and suggestive of an infectious cause. However, the significance of this association is unknown.Recent weight gain as well as weight loss should alert the clinician to the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or underlying medical condition. Teenagers who have eating disorders often resort to desperate, even dangerous measures to improve their self-esteem or to enhance their image. Attempts at weight reduction often involve self-injurious behaviors, such as severe caloric deprivation, excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, and the use of appetite suppressants, laxatives, diuretics, or emetics. Fatigue from rapid fluid shifts or hypokalemia is especially common among bulimics, whose weight may fluctuate dramatically as a result of the frequent episodes of binging and purging. In contrast, patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa usually seem to have boundless energy, even in a state of severe emaciation.Adolescents who engage in competitive activities in which thinness or “making weight” are judged important to success are believed to be particularly susceptible to unhealthy weight control practices. Such activities include body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, modeling, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling. As the preoccupation with thinness supersedes the desire to be healthy, physically active young women are at risk for a group of signs and symptoms known as the female athlete triad. Lack of information and the strong desire to win contribute to this condition, which consists of abnormal eating patterns, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. In many instances, these girls become less competitive as they begin to tire more easily and have less stamina.Adolescents should be screened for stress, anxiety, and depression, which frequently are associated with fatigue in this age group. The three most common sources of conflict are problems at home, strained peer relationships, and school-related difficulties. Having a job or not having a job for those in financial need may be an added source of pressure. The practitioner also should look for feelings of sadness, changes in behavior, difficulty concentrating, declining school performance, and other symptoms of depression. Most teens respond openly when asked if they get upset or depressed easily and if they have ever felt like hurting themselves or someone else. Any positive responses can be pursued by asking the patient to “tell me about this.” It must be stressed that adolescents who are actively suicidal or homicidal require immediate intervention by mental health experts, legal authorities, or both.Recent exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus as well as to other contagious diseases such as hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis should be determined. Asking about pets, tick bites, recent travel, and water supply sometimes is fruitful. A search also should be made for symptoms of cardiac disorders, pulmonary conditions, endocrinopathies, gastrointestinal problems, and renal abnormalities. The menstrual history should be obtained from adolescent girls, looking for amenorrhea, irregular periods, or excessive bleeding, which may suggest the possibility of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous miscarriage, recent termination, or threatened abortion. In addition, the patients should be asked about the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications that have a known sedative effect.The clinician also should inquire about symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension, a condition that has been associated with unexplained fatigue in adolescents. Neurally mediated hypotension leads to symptoms after prolonged periods of upright posture, standing in place, standing in the shower, and even sitting. It is especially common when the patient is in a warm environment and after emotionally stressful events. In addition, it may be seen immediately after exercise or soon after eating in some patients as blood flow is shifted to the intestines during the process of digestion.Common symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension include recurrent light-headedness and fainting, which often are associated with postexertional fatigue for 24 to 72 hours. Of particular note, persistent fatigue is a prominent feature of this condition in many adolescents, even if there is no history of fainting. In addition, headaches, myalgias, and mental confusion may occur. The latter frequently is described by patients as being in a “mental fog,” with difficulty concentrating, trouble paying attention, having a hard time staying on task, and having problems finding the right words. Occasionally, shortness of breath with or without chest pain may occur.Any history of recurrent or persistent fever should be documented in the clinician’s office. Unexplained temperature elevation suggests the presence of an underlying infection, neoplasm, or other inflammatory process such as Crohn disease. Hypothermia occurs frequently in patients who have experienced rapid or excessive weight loss. This finding is especially common among adolescents who have eating disorders in whom the low body temperature helps to conserve energy to help compensate for losses from severe caloric deprivation or purging. In addition, hypothyroidism always should be suspected in teenagers who are fatigued, whose temperatures tend to run below normal, and who gain weight in spite of what appear to be appropriate restrictions in dietary intake.Anxiety and stress are the most common causes of tachycardia in the practitioner’s office. They also are important sources of fatigue in adolescents, especially in patients who are not sleeping well. Marijuana is another frequent cause of tachycardia and should be considered in teenagers who appear to be excessively tired or poorly motivated. Stimulant drugs that have been prescribed, purchased over-the-counter, or taken illegally may cause an accelerated heart rate. Fatigue is relatively common when the effects of these drugs begin to wear off. Endocrine abnormalities, including Addison disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism, as well as a number of pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions may cause an elevated pulse rate in patients who are fatigued.Significant weight loss from voluntary caloric restriction is characteristically accompanied by sinus bradycardia, especially in patients who are hypothermic. This is an important physical finding that may help to distinguish adolescents who have eating disorders or those who are simply getting in shape from those who have an underlying organic cause for their weight loss. On the other hand, unexplained weight gain in patients who have bradycardia and fatigue should raise the suspicion of hypothyroidism. A slow pulse rate also may be caused by various medications or street drugs that have a known sedative effect.Abnormalities in the respiratory rate in association with fatigue may indicate a cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic disorder. Variations in the breathing pattern also may be seen with the use, abuse, or withdrawal of many prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or street drugs.As with tachycardia, anxiety and stress are the most common causes of hypertension identified in the examination room. However, the finding of elevated blood pressure in association with fatigue may be due to several important medical conditions, including connective tissue disorders, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hyperthyroidism, and renal abnormalities. Routine use, abuse, or withdrawal of over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, or illicit psychoactive substances also may cause hypertension and fatigue.Delayed orthostatic hypotension after prolonged standing also has been described in patients who have unexplained fatigue (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Hypotension also may be noted as an adverse effect of various medications or in relation to abuse of street drugs. Adolescents who have Addison disease are especially susceptible to dehydration with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, particularly during periods of physical stress. Addison disease always should be suspected in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially when there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.It is very important to plot height routinely throughout the adolescent years. Failure of a patient to progress along the expected parameters should draw immediate attention to the possibility of an underlying systemic process affecting growth and causing unexplained fatigue. In contrast, a normal linear growth velocity all but excludes the presence of an underlying endocrinopathy, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing syndrome, which may cause fatigue in association with obesity. A normal linear growth velocity also lessens the possibility of chronic cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or renal disorders in teenagers who are excessively tired.It is also very important to plot weight throughout adolescence. Patients who have excessive weight gain or loss should be evaluated carefully for the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or medical condition. Poor weight gain over time also may be a subtle manifestation of a serious underlying illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, especially in adolescents who have an unexplained low energy level.The examiner’s first impression about the patient’s overall well-being can be very insightful. Does the patient look ill or well? Does the patient seem to be depressed, anxious, or stressed? Does the patient seem to be adequately nourished?The skin may serve as a window to underlying systemic causes of fatigue in adolescents. Jaundice suggests the presence of hepatitis or hemolysis. A yellow cast to the skin due to hypercarotenemia may be seen in patients who have anorexia nervosa and ingest large amounts of yellow-orange fruits and vegetables. This is a benign physical finding that resembles icterus, but the sclera are not involved. It should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of an eating disorder that may be otherwise unrecognized.Cyanosis may indicate the presence of a significant abnormality in the cardiovascular or pulmonary system, especially when digital clubbing also is present. The findings may be extremely subtle and only detectable by meticulous examination. A patient of mine had a somewhat sallow appearance. He was tired all the time, but was otherwise totally asymptomatic. During the consultation, he had bounding pulses that eventually led to the diagnosis of a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation as the cause of symptoms.Pallor usually is associated with iron deficiency anemia resulting from inadequate dietary intake, rapid growth, or blood loss. The latter is especially common in adolescent girls who are having heavy menstrual periods. However, many other important causes of anemia must be considered in this age group, including chronic inflammation, hemolysis, malignancy, and vitamin B12 deficiency, the latter especially in those who are on a vegan diet. Fatigue is a relatively late manifestation of anemia and usually is noted only in moderate-to-severe anemia that has developed over time. Pallor also may be a sign of anxiety, abuse of psychoactive drugs, and the allergic tension fatigue syndrome.Generalized hyperpigmentation may be seen in patients who have fatigue associated with Addison disease. A clue to this diagnosis is involvement of the unexposed areas of skin as well as accentuation of the hyperpigmentation over the axillae, nipples, umbilicus, genitalia, or extensor surfaces of the joints. The clinician also should look carefully at the dorsum of the hands for evidence of superficial ulcerations, calluses, or scars in patients who have bulimia. This is known as Russell sign and is caused by using the fingers to induce vomiting in an effort to control weight. Many patients who have bulimia suffer from fatigue because of fluid or electrolyte imbalance as well as associated depression. Other signs of self-mutilation, such as cuts, scars, scratches, burns, and carved-out tatoos, may be seen in patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem.A number of skin findings may provide insight into the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease, infectious process, or other inflammatory condition that could cause fatigue in adolescents. A butterfly or discoid rash and photosensitivity are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Flushed cheeks followed by the appearance of a lacy, reticulated rash over the trunk and extremities are found in Fifth disease, which may cause persistent fatigue in teenagers. An evanescent, salmon-colored rash that has irregular borders or serpiginous margins is seen in patients who have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and frequently is accompanied by fever. Subcutaneous nodules also may occur with this condition and are located near the olecranon process, on the dorsal aspect of the hands or knees, near the ears, and over pressure areas such as the scapulae, sacrum, buttocks, and heels. These nodules are usually nontender. In contrast, erythema nodosum is characterized by exquisitely tender, erythematous nodular lesions over the extensor surfaces of the extremities, especially on the pretibial surface of the legs. These lesions frequently recur and are associated with many inflammatory disorders that cause fatigue.Raynaud phenomenon, with characteristic color changes of the fingers and toes, should raise suspicion of a connective tissue disease or other underlying cause. Nailbed capillary changes with dilation and tortuosity of the vessels may be a very subtle finding in patients who have collagen vascular diseases. Cutaneous sclerosis, especially of the digits and face, is associated with scleroderma. In addition, an erythematous, purplish discoloration of the eyelids, forehead, cheeks, temples, dorsal interphalangeal joints, and extensor surfaces of the extremities suggests dermatomyositis.The presence of “allergic shiners” or a bluish discoloration under the eyes often is seen with sinusitis as well as with the allergic tension fatigue syndrome. Injection of the bulbar conjunctivae is common among those who use marijuana. Sjögren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of unknown cause characterized by dry eyes, xerostomia, salivary gland enlargement, and a high incidence of connective tissue disease. Evidence of iritis or uveitis suggests the presence of a connective tissue disorder or other underlying inflammatory process, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Several oral findings have been noted in patients who have eating disorders, including enamel erosion or caries, particularly over the inner aspect of the upper teeth. This finding probably is related to repeated exposure to gastric contents following self-induced vomiting. Swelling of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands also has been described in those who have bulimia. Enlargement of the submandibular glands may be especially difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region. In most instances, the salivary tissue has a softer consistency than the enlarged nodes, but there may be considerable overlap. Infection or other causes of inflammation in the salivary glands also may be associated with fatigue.Evidence of stomatitis, gingivitis, or glossitis in teenagers who are excessively tired may indicate an underlying systemic process. Recurrent mouth ulcers, especially if they are unusually severe or recalcitrant to therapy, are relatively common in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Behçet syndrome is a rare multisystem vasculitis characterized by the triad of recurrent oral ulcers, iridocyclitis, and recurrent ulcers of the external genitalia as well as a variety of other findings that may be accompanied by fatigue. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the gums is seen with Addison disease.The adolescent’s strength should be assessed to differentiate conditions that are associated with muscular weakness from other causes of fatigue. Muscular dystrophy always must be considered. Patients who have myasthenia gravis often experience weakness only late in the day or after physical activity. The clinician should search for other signs of myasthenia gravis that sometimes are subtle, including evidence of ptosis, weakness of the extraocular muscles, and dysphagia. The diminished strength noted in dermatomyositis may be generalized, but it is predominantly proximal, with involvement of the limb girdles and anterior flexors.Objective evidence of arthritis strongly supports an organic cause for the fatigue, such as connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infection, or neoplasm. Localized bone pain or tenderness to direct palpation may be associated with anatomic lesions, both benign and malignant. Unexplained bone pain that awakens the patient at night is especially concerning for leukemia or similar invasive processes. Clubbing of the fingers or toes suggests the possibility of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or liver disease.A careful neurologic examination should be performed to help exclude rare causes of fatigue in adolescents, such as multiple sclerosis. The Chiari malformation also may be associated with subtle neurologic signs in association with fatigue. I recently had a patient in whom the cerebellar tonsils protruded into the spinal canal and compressed the nerves innervating the palate. The floppy palatal tissue resulted in obstructive sleep apnea, and the patient awakened unrefreshed in the morning. The family sought medical attention after the teachers complained that the girl had been falling asleep in class. A decompression procedure was performed by neurosurgery, and the girl’s fatigue resolved completely.Facial tenderness suggests the presence of sinusitis, although this finding often is absent in this condition. Persistent lymphadenopathy may be seen with infection, malignancy, connective tissue disease, or other inflammatory processes. The thyroid gland should be palpated for any enlargement or nodules. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue. The lungs, heart, and abdomen should be assessed carefully for any abnormalities that may provide a clue to the diagnosis. The costovertebral angles should be palpated for any tenderness that may suggest pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, or other renal abnormality. In addition, patients who have generalized ligamentous laxity frequently experience vague musculoskeletal pain and are tired, especially late in the day. Finally, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered in adolescent girls and a pelvic examination performed when indicated.The differential diagnosis of fatigue is extensive and includes numerous organic disorders as well as many psychosocial-medical conditions (Table 2). Sometimes a combination of factors contributes to the fatigue, especially when it is unduly prolonged. It is relatively common for an initial medical illness to take on features of a psychiatric condition as the process evolves. Psychologic issues may emerge as the primary agenda or develop as a consequence of an organic illness. A psychiatric diagnosis should not be assigned solely by the process of exclusion; the appropriate diagnostic criteria must be met before such a diagnosis is made.Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression may be especially difficult to sort out in adolescents who are fatigued. Failure to attend school may compound an already difficult situation by perpetuating progressive absenteeism. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that masked school avoidance may be contributing to the fatigue. The hyperventilation syndrome may present with fatigue in association with difficulty breathing, chest pain, lightheadedness, headaches, abdominal pain, and numbness or tingling of the extremities. In addition, fatigue may be a sign of certain eating disorders, especially bulimia and obesity, which frequently are accompanied by poor self-esteem, feelings of guilt, and depression. Patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa typically do not tire easily unless they are moribund or the weight loss has been rapid.Clinicians always should consider the possibility of Addison disease in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially if there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. There usually is generalized hyperpigmentation with involvement of unexposed surfaces as well as accentuation in areas of predilection, as described earlier. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia are useful diagnostic features, but are not always present. The most definitive diagnostic test is the ACTH stimulation test (described later). It is imperative to consider Addison disease in the differential diagnosis because if it is not recognized and treated, an adrenal crisis may supervene.Many adolescents who have unexplained fatigue begin with a “mono-like” illness that never resolves completely, and all diagnostic testing results are negative. As with acute infectious mononucleosis, these patients often have a history of severe sore throat, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headaches, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia with or without evidence of arthritis. Many of the symptoms recur or linger for months in association with the fatigue. In addition, whenever a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is being entertained, the clinician should consider the possibility of infection with Toxoplasma gondii or cytomegalovirus, which may cause similar symptoms.The association between orthostatic blood pressure changes and prolonged fatigue was described by Streeten and Anderson in 1992, who studied seven patients who had lightheadedness, fatigue, “weakness,” and sometimes syncope. Blood pressures were measured every minute with an automated oscillometer while the patients remained standing. There was no fall in blood pressure after standing for a few minutes, which is the endpoint in traditional testing. However, there was a severe fall in blood pressure in all patients after they stood for 13 to 30 minutes, often with syncope or presyncope. Rowe and associates later described four adolescents who had a history of fatigue and underwent tilt-table testing. This procedure induced significant hypotension in all after they were tilted upright for 12 to 23 minutes. Their fatigue improved dramatically after they were treated for orthostatic hypotension.It is not known why patients who have prolonged fatigue develop these cardiovascular changes when they assume the upright posture. When normal individuals stand up, blood pools in the legs, catecholamines increase to compensate for the decreased venous return to the heart, and there is a compensatory increase in heart rate that involves more vigorous contractions. The reduced amount of blood flow to the heart is pumped more efficiently to the vital organs, especially the brain. In contrast, when individuals who have neurally mediated hypotension stand up, there appears to be a “miscommunication” between the heart and the brain. The heart rate slows while the vessels in the arms and legs dilate. As a result, even more blood is taken from the brain, and the patients feel faint. Finally, an abnormal increase in heart rate after prolonged standing has been described in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue. This condition is known as delayed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and it may occur with or without hypotension.In many instances, no diagnostic studies are required after a thorough history and careful physical examination. The costs of investigative studies are high, and any unnecessary testing should be avoided unless specifically indicated. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain, the clinician should consider a screening evaluation that includes the baseline tests shown in Table 3.The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes, liver profile, and urinalysis allow rapid assessment of target organ status in response to a systemic illness. Rheumatologic studies help exclude systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases that may present with fatigue. Thyroid studies always should be performed because manifestations of thyroid conditions often are subtle early in the course of the illness. A high morning cortisol level goes against a diagnosis of Addison disease, but the ACTH stimulation test is the definitive test to exclude this condition. In normal individuals, the serum cortisol level increases two- to three-fold 1 hour after intravenous administration of a synthetic ACTH prepa",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization is a dissociative disorder, causing alteration in the perception or experience of the self and a detachment from reality. This is a fascinating and clinically relevant phenomenon neglected within psychiatry. Far from being a rare condition, it can be as prevalent as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and frequently occurs in association with other neuropsychiatric conditions. This book is a review of depersonalization, dealing with the subject from a wide range of perspectives and covering historical, conceptual, clinical, trans-cultural, pharmacological and neurobiological factors. It discusses recent neuroimaging studies providing fresh insights into the condition and opening up new opportunities to manage the symptoms with pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions. It will be relevant to psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as well as primary care practitioners, neurologists and psychiatric nurses.",

The consequence of infertility is stressful and sometimes it is difficult for both patients and family members to cope with this stress. It is a challenge to find out the stress and manage it. This article embraces mental health problems that patient may suffer during course of treatment. It is essential to take mental health care of both partners. Patient may suffer from depression, anxiety, somatoform disorder, etc. Some patient has chance to develop behavioral problem such as palpitation, irritability, social withdrawal, suspiciousness, breathlessness, etc. During treatment procedure patient has to go through lots of pressure such as prolonged treatment, side effects of drugs, schedule problem with doctors, lots of investigations, oblique comments, lack of support from friends and family, financial insolvency, marital conflict, etc. that compel patient to begin mental health problem. It is mandatory for family members to take care of mental health of both partners otherwise mental health issues can delays the good outcome of treatment. If needed it is required to seek help from psychiatrist. Psychiatrist has to play important role to deal with not only mental health issues but also to help patients and family members to lead a normal and enjoyable life. Patients suffering from infertility should start treatment as early as possible and take good care of mental health with support of family members. By this way we will be able to expect good result of treatment and can ensure a healthy family life.",

      "abstract": "Wajaul Mafasil (Rheumatoid arthritis) has become one of the most pressing global public health problems. In India alone an estimated 1% population is suffering from W M. Wajaul Mafasil which is a future threat to the physical, psychological, social and economic well being of the human beings. It often deprives people of their freedom and independence and can disrupt the lives of family members and other care givers. Physical symptoms of arthritis, pain, loss of joint movement and fatigue puts individuals at higher risk for a variety of other diseases, including premature death, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, colon cancer, overweight, depression and anxiety. In fact, in its severe forms WM can shorten life expectancy. Psychological stress depression, anger and anxiety often accompany WM. People with WM may experience difficulty in coping with pain and disability which in turn can lead to a feeling of helplessness, lack of self-control and changes in self esteem and self image. Social well-being is also affected by decreased community involvement, difficulties in their work place and in sexual activities. These social problems are often aggravated by lack of understanding and empathy among family members, co-workers, employers, etc. Based on the references available in the Unani Classics the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine formulated some simple new combination of drugs and subjected them to multicentric trials at Council's institutes. Prior to multicentric trial, preliminary screening was performed at the Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Chennai in the year 1979 in which significant effects and clinical safety was observed. Later, the formulations were modified and multicentric study was undertaken along with some other combinations at Councils centres at Lucknow, Bhadrak, Mumbai, New Delhi, Srinagar and Bangalore. Multidimensional studies covering clinical, pathological, biochemical, physiological, herido-familial aspects in WM patients were studied besides Munzij and Mushil therapy and Hajamat (cupping). Since 1979, 40,000 patients were registered and treated at different centres of the Council. Out of these 8,000 patients fulfilling the research criteria were registered for study. Seven thousand five hundred and twenty-nine patients completed the study in different treatment groups. The cases were diagnosed on the basis of the sign and symptoms as per Unani classification taking in to consideration the involvement different humors, and the stage of the disease etc and correlated with the modern parameters 1987 revised ARA/ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. The cases were classified as per standard criteria of possible, probable, definite and classical stages.",

      "abstract": "Pendidikan kedokteran merupakan jurusan akademik yang sangat diminati dan ditargetkan oleh banyak kalangan. Namun, dalam proses pembelajarannya, seorang mahasiswa kedokteran harus menghadapi berbagai tuntutan akademik yang berat dan dapat menyebabkan kesehatan mentalnya terganggu. Gangguan kesehatan mental merupakan kondisi seseorang mengalami gangguan psikologis sehingga menyebabkan perubahan negatif pada kesejahteraan hidup, fisiologis kejiwaan, dan kecakapan hidup. Beberapa contoh gangguan ini adalah perasaan stres, cemas, dan depresi. Stres merupakan reaksi tertekan pada tubuh terhadap besarnya tuntutan dan kewajiban yang harus dilakukan dalam waktu tertentu. Cemas adalah kondisi seseorang yang merasa gelisah, takut, dan khawatir yang terlalu berlebihan terhadap masa depan. Depresi merupakan kondisi berkurangnya energi tubuh, berkurangnya minat dalam menjalankan aktivitas sehari-hari, serta perasaan sedih yang berkepanjangan. Segala stresor yang menyebabkan gangguan kesehatan mental ini tidak hanya didapatkan dari proses pembelajaran, namun juga didapatkan dari kondisi eksternal, seperti tekanan dari teman sejawat, finansial, dan keluarga. Gangguan kesehatan mental mampu memberikan pengaruh besar bagi mahasiswa kedokteran dalam melaksanakan aktivitas perkuliahannya, salah satunya adalah pengaruhnya terhadap hasil Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter (UKMPPD). UKMPPD merupakan exit exam nasional bagi mahasiswa program profesi dokter yang harus diambil sebelum mengangkat sumpah dokter, ujian ini terdiri atas Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) dan Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Kondisi mental yang tidak sehat berpengaruh pada kinerja mahasiswa dalam menganalisis setiap materi yang akan dipelajari. Besarnya beban mental yang ditampung mahasiswa akan membuat diri mereka tidak fokus untuk mempelajari materi secara terstruktur sehingga tidak semua materi dapat dipelajari dengan baik. Hal ini bermuara pada hasil UKMPPD yang tidak optimal.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the conceptual problems in distinguishing between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome, for both may present with fatigue as the main symptom. Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "title": "The impact of severe mental disorders and psychotropic medications on sexual health and its implications for clinical management",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

The stress-induced anhedonic-like state characterizes by hypothermia, hypercortisolemia, and hypermelatoninemia associated with disturbances in the circadian system. Mainly Per2 and Bmal1 demonstrate altered expression in the brain and liver: expression of Per2 is sensitive to stress and changes in Bmal1 mostly associated with depressive behavior. The Per1 expression is sustainable in maintaining the circadian rhythm. A normalization of the expression patterns is likely to be essential for the recovery from the pathological state. Depression is a high prevalent disorder. The number of incidents is rising due to changes in lifestyle. The symptomatology is inconsistent and it is difficult to agree on one hypothesis. The disturbances of the 24 h circadian rhythm may be a factor in the development of major depressive disorder. The molecular biology underlying a causal relationship between circadian rhythm and mood disorders is slowly being unraveled. However, many questions still need to be answered.",

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

Depressive illness is the most common associated psychiatric disorder that is found in patients with chronic pain. The three most typical symptoms of a depressive illness are: depressed mood; loss of interest and pleasure; and loss of energy and increased fatigue. Anxiety disorders have been found to be correlated more closely than depression with chronic painful conditions in a large US sample of chronic pain patients. Panic disorder comprises severe unpredictable anxiety episodes that can occur \"out of the blue,\" although they are usually more common in one situation than another.

This study presents the case of a 2-year-old male transitional patient who was taken to the emergency room dead and with multiple lesions in the body from different dates. There was a history of leaving hospitalization four days ago. Necropsy was performed finding multiple signs of violence on inner and outer examination of the body. A conclusion of violent death is reached as a case of battered child syndrome, with child abuse produced by action, in its variant of physical mistreatment.",

MS is a major cause of neurological disability among the middle-aged and is an important condition cared for in general practice. Among the physical symptoms seen are fatigue, focal neurological deficits and both sexual and sphincter dysfunction. It is also recognised that psychiatric symptoms play a role in the disease course. These may be owing to the direct effects of demyelination, the emotional reaction to this illness, a poor adjustment to chronic illness or the use of steroids. Transient mood changes, such as anxiety and irritability, are experienced by two-thirds of patients in any year, while major depressive criteria are met in one-third of patients.1 Other mood disturbances less commonly seen are euphoria, mania, and pathological laughing or crying.",

In cases of secondary hypertension, there is an identified physiological abnormality or exogenous substances causing the high blood pressure. When the exact cause of the elevated blood pressure is unknown, the condition is called primary or essential hypertension. This chapter examines studies that present evidence linking stress with the onset of essential hypertension. These studies are categorized into several different types: studies of major life event stressors, studies of job stress and strain, studies on cultural influences on stress and blood pressure, and animal research linking stress to hypertension.",

      "abstract": "A study about the problem of stress in physician who work in intensive care units requires a previous reflection about the stress concept itself. Selye's conception undoubtedly signified a great progress for the comprehension of the processes of biological adaptation, but it seems it can not be easily applied to the psychological and social field. The decrease of psychosomatic diseases during the last world war is one of the many examples that make question the causal relationship between stress and disease. The concept of life event in anglo-saxon psychiatry is also discussed, as well as its attempt to measure the stressor character of these circumstances through a scale of points. The concept of \"pathogenic situation\" of German psychiatry is proposed in exchange. From this perspective, medicine in general and intensive medicine in particular can be seen as human activities constituting \"pathogenic situations\" for the ones who exercise them. The corresponding literature allows to establish that medicine generates more pathology in physicians than other professions, but intensive medicine does not seem to be more pathogenic than other specialties. The elements of the \"medical act\" which could be responsible for the stress or pathogenic situation are studied. Respecting intensive medicine, two are the characteristics which seem to contribute to make it \"pathogenic\" for those who exercise it: a mistaken vision of death as an \"enemy\" which has to be fought à outrance, and the \"temporality of urgency\", proper to an ICU, which makes that the doctor can not give himself time enough for listening to the patient and telling him the adequate word of consolation.",

The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The dystonias belong to a group of patologies included on movement disorders. They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

      "title": "Parkinson’s Disease, Religious Belief and Spirituality",
      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "abstract": "Depression is more common in old age than dementia yet is underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is important to recognise that patients may not always present in a typical way, features that may indicate depression include anxiety, a preoccupation with somatic symptoms, and a change in function. The presence of understandable triggers and causes should not deter GPs from offering treatment, as long as symptoms are pervasive and continuously persist beyond two weeks. Age-related disabilities and changes to physical health are major risk factors for depression in older people. Vascular diseases, including stroke, MI and diabetes increase the risk of depression, both through direct effects on the brain and the psychological effects. Likewise, dementia is a risk factor for depression. Psychological factors such as loneliness and loss of a valued role, as well as social factors related to retirement, bereavement and reduced independence may also increase the risk. Patients with a previous history of depression and anxiety disorders are at increased risk of depression in later life. Assessment and diagnosis are largely based on a careful history. This should focus on eliciting current features of depression, which have been present for at least two weeks, and are associated with a significant change in function. It is important to exclude organic disorders including anaemia, B12 and folate deficiency, and hypothyroidism that may mimic symptoms of depressive disorder. Referral to specialist mental health services is indicated in the following cases: diagnostic difficulty, poor response to treatment, psychotic symptoms, significant psychiatric comorbidity or a risk of self-neglect or suicide.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

The onset of psychotic symptoms during the postpartum period is considered a psychiatric emergency. This usually occurs in the first two weeks after childbirth. The etiology of postpartum psychosis is not fully known, but genetic and hormonal factors appear to be related. Women with history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, family history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, first pregnancy and recent discontinuation of lithium have increased risk to develop postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis usually presents as a combination of psychotic and mood disorder symptoms. In some cases, patient's mental status is altered. These women have a higher risk of suicide and infanticide. Other causes of psychosis should be excluded, such as intoxication or drug withdrawal, metabolic encephalopathy, endocrine dysfunction or central nervous system lesions. An acute approach should include hospitalization, antipsychotic medication and treatment of the underlying disorder. Prophylactic treatment with mood stabilizers should be considered in women previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis episodes can be severe and prolonged, and may affect bonding between mother and infant.",

It is perceived as a parafunctional activity, and it can lead to instability and various consequences such as dental wear, musculoskeletal pain, masseter hypertrophy, persistent fatigue, and tension headaches. According to the time of occurrence, it can be classified as awake bruxism and/or sleep bruxism. This case report describes a 19-year-old woman, who presented to her family doctor with shoulder pain, headaches, and persistent tiredness despite apparent adequate sleep. She reported no other symptoms and denied any trauma or physical exertion. Her past medical history included anxiety disorder, treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and irregular follow-ups with psychology and psychiatry throughout the years. The only relevant findings on the physical examination were cervical and shoulder tenderness, without functional impairment, along with noticeable wear on dental surfaces, consistent with bruxism. Further history of overall behaviour was compatible with both sleep and awake bruxism, exacerbated during periods of increased anxiety. The SSRI dose was increased, and a muscle relaxant was prescribed. A referral was made to both psychology and dentistry. After two weeks, a reduction in anxiety, headaches, and musculoskeletal pain was observed, with only sporadic use of the muscle relaxant. A dental splint was prescribed following dental evaluation, resulting in significant clinical improvement: better anxiety control, improved sleep quality, occasional musculoskeletal complaints, and reduced headaches. Although the patient did not initially complain of bruxism, the presence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity with repetitive contractions and increased muscle tension highlighted the need to identify this condition as a clinical target for intervention and treatment. Early diagnosis is essential to minimize complications and prevent symptom dispersion. Otherwise, bruxism may be overlooked as a central diagnosis, and treatment opportunities may be missed. Given its multifactorial aetiology, management must be multidisciplinary, as demonstrated in this case.",

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

Persistent headache, in particular, evokes concerns about an otherwise-overlooked underlying cause, although many chronic headaches are also primary (without a single underlying cause) in nature. The “state of the art” of pharmacotherapy for this primary headache syndrome is very much a work in progress. The recognition of a migraine component, or of psychological comorbidities is very important for these patients. Key nonpharmacological interventions are often most useful.",

      "title": "Chronic Hiccups: An Underestimated Problem",
      "abstract": "Persistent singultus, hiccupping that lasts for longer than 48 hours, can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s quality of life. Although involved neurologic structures have been identified, the function of hiccups remains unclear—they have been controversially interpreted as a primitive reflex preventing extent swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, an archaic gill ventilation pattern, or a fetus’ preparation for independent breathing. Persistent singultus often presents as a symptom for various diseases, most commonly illnesses of the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract; they can also be evoked by a variety of pharmacological agents. It is often impossible to define a singular cause. A wide range of treatment attempts, pharmacological and nonpharmacological, have been concerted to this date; however, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration–approved drug in this context. Large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies are lacking. Gabapentin, baclofen, and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, eg, proton pump inhibitors, or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. When managing hiccup patients within the clinical routine, it is of importance to conduct a comprehensive and effective diagnostic workup; a well-functioning interdisciplinary team is needed to address possible causes for the symptom. Persistent singultus is a medical problem not to be underestimated; more research on options for effective treatment would be greatly needed.",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

By the definition, it is the fear of witnessing the negative judgement and the criticism of other people, which is so intense that, is followed by reactions of avoidance of phobic situations and doings, followed by intense vegetative symptoms. Aim Introduce social phobia as an important social and medical problem with common co-morbidity and exceptional risk of suicide. At the same time it gives special accent to the diagnostic procedures and differential diagnosis. Method Analysis of the information from literature and practice and coming to conclusions with the inductive method. Results Social phobia is a chronicle illness, equally present in both sexes. The central position is taken by all-the-time present intense irrational fear. Alcoholism, misuse of sedatives, depression, and panic with agoraphobia, OCD are common followers of social phobia. Differential diagnosis witch eliminates panic with agoraphobia, or just the lack of social skills allows the right therapeutic approach. Conclusion Social phobia, alone or combined with other disorders, has a huge medical and social value. Coming back to regular life tracks depends on the right diagnosis and the right time to go into the healing process.

      "abstract": "Syncope in the aviation environment can be a very difficult problem to assess. Even more difficult is the differential diagnosis between convulsive syncope and epilepsy after the first event. This paper discusses syncope in general and the differential diagnosis between vasovagal syncope and other forms of syncope. About 50% of all syncopal episodes cannot be identified as to etiology. However, a benign outcome for a single syncopal episode, non-cardiac in origin, is the norm. The diagnosis of syncope is discussed, emphasizing that a meticulous history from an observer or the patient, a good physical examination, and an ECG are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Other diagnostic venues are discussed. Convulsive syncope occurs in only about 12% of syncopal episodes, 65% of these being vasovagal in origin. The other 35% are due to a variety of causes. We found no good algorithm to differentiate convulsive syncope from epilepsy. We reviewed the literature to develop a differential diagnostic table, focusing on: age, awake status, position, emotional/physiologic stressors, onset, aura, appearance, injury on falling, seizure characteristics, automatism, length of unconsciousness and subsequent confusion, pulse characteristics, blood pressure, urinary incontinence, seizure duration, recovery time post-event, post-seizure sequelae, amnesia, posture vs. recovery, EEG characteristics, and the value of sophisticated diagnostic procedures.",

      "title": "‘Causal relation between spasticity, strength, gross motor function, and functional outcome in children with cerebral palsy: a path analysis’",
      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

It has been demonstrated<sup>1</sup>that there is little or no correlation between the severity of the mental disturbance and the physical symptoms; children with slight mental disturbance may have extreme physical findings and vice versa.

Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life. Finally, it keeps researchers away from certain domains of medicine and has a negative impact on funding for research and treatment.

      "abstract": "Mental illness is referred to as a condition that tends to impact a person's thinking, feeling or mood and may affect his or her ability to relate to others and function on a daily basis.Many children may grow up with a parent suffering from some mental health condition at some point of time in his/her life.Few of these children live with a parent who has severe psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.Coping with the stress of parental psychiatric illness is often very challenging for children as such illness creates an inconsistent, unpredictable family environment and may seriously hamper the parenting abilities of the couple.Children of such parents, while battling every day with the disorder of their parent, often experience stress of caring for the ill parent and also responsibility of siblings.They may themselves experience an array of problems including difficulties in concentrating on studies, anxiety, fear of developing same illness, so on and so forth.However, despite of these difficulties, some of these children seem to be achieving extraordinary success in their lives.They not only are able to do well in academics, but also maintain their emotional health, develop and sustain good relationships and at times reach out to help other individuals suffering from similar conditions out of compassion.What factors could be underlying this healthy coping?Could it be accounted to the differences in personality, resilience or specific coping strategies used by them?The present paper is a humble attempt to find answers to these questions.The aim of the study is to develop an in-depth understanding of above mentioned and many other such factors.Hence the qualitative analysis has been used.Specific research method used is narrative analysis which includes interviews with some such children (adult children).The implications of the research can be found in individual as well as group counseling, schools, colleges and other mental health care facilities.",

Due to the specific features of the anatomy of cerebral circulation, hypertensive microangiopathy leads primarily to damage to the subcortical basal ganglia and deep white matter. Clinically, this is manifested by a concurrence of predominantly subcortical cognitive impairment and emotional and behavioral disorders as depression, emotional lability, and apathy. Some features of depression, such as the prevalence of anhedonia and fatigue and the significant severity of cognitive and somatic symptoms in an elderly person with vascular disease, suggest its organic nature (vascular depression).",

Development of effective management strategies is hindered by confusing terminology.Research investigating treatments often use \"agitation\" or \"behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)\" as an outcome measure without differentiating the context in which these behaviors occurred.Actually, a recent review of 85 measures, used for assessing behavioral symptoms of dementia, found that \"no measures identify risk factors for behaviors or enable an evaluation of the context in which behaviors occur\". 1 At the same time, it is recognized that there is a need for identification of context in which behavior occurred for effective management as is described in the DICE approach. 2,3e most important context in which behavior occurs is presence or absence of another person.This context can distinguish two main types of behaviors: agitation and rejection of care. 4Agitation can be defined as \"behaviors that communicate to others [who observe the patient] that the patient is experiencing and unpleasant state of excitement and which remain after interventions to reduce internal or external stimuli have been carried out\". 5i.e., medical conditions, pain, medication side-effects, environmental factors, hunger or thirst, and others.Symptoms of agitation include general restlessness, repetitive mannerisms, pacing, trying to get to a different place, handling inappropriately, hiding things, inappropriate dressing and undressing and repetitive sentences. 6Agitation occurs when the person with dementia does not interact with others, i.e., is solitary.Rejection of care occurs in most cases when a caregiver tries to provide care for a person who does not understand the need for it, or misperceives the action as threatening, and resists caregiver's actions. 7If the caregiver insists to provide care, the person with dementia may defend himself/herself from unwanted attention, may become combative and develop reactive aggression.This reactive aggression can be defined as \"the repertoire of behaviors with which persons with dementia withstand of oppose the efforts of a caregiver\". 8and includes hitting, pushing, scratching, grabbing things or people, kicking and biting, screaming, cursing, temper outbursts, and making strange noises. 9",

      "title": "Bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is rapidly becoming the primary diagnosis in adult psychiatry. It represents a wide spectrum of disorder all sharing common features of elated and depressed mood. The early descriptions of symptom-free euthymia have long been dismissed and the chronic and enduring deficits associated with the disorder are beginning to be better understood. The course of the disorder remains uncertain especially in light of the recently observed increases in children receiving the diagnosis. There is growing interest in the elated states seen as a common adolescent phenotype. There is a simplified view of the illness as an episodic course interspersed with euthymia, short-term treatments being used in acute episodes and long-term treatments being indefinite and intended to prevent new episodes. However, subsyndromes, co-morbidities and a variety of chronic symptoms are common in bipolar disorder. In practice, they often drive treatment decisions. Chronic symptoms are usually related to anxiety, depression or cognition and are a disabling aspect of the long-term outcome. Unfortunately, there is little to guide the selection of treatment to reduce the impact of these symptoms since they have almost never been the subject of clinical trials. The use of medication in combinations is the usual practice in bipolar disorder. The argument to favour this in guidelines is highly pragmatic, but there is a growing evidence base to support it. Lithium remains a key benchmark treatment for comparing alternatives in long term efficacy. Its effects against suicide are particularly important.",

      "title": "Clinical Effectiveness of Tofrānil in the Treatment of Depressive Psychoses",
      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the conclusion of this two-part article, the authors present the notion of psychiatric confounders to assist non–psychiatric physicians in assessing the “difficult pain patient.” Non–psychiatric physicians need not have a detailed understanding of all psychiatric diagnoses, but an understanding of certain diagnoses will assist in evaluating patients with enduring pain complaints. Psychosocial factors have important effects on the relationship between pain and disability. In one study, job satisfaction was a predictor of future disability in low back pain patients; in another study, psychiatric morbidity in a pain-free population predicted the development of back pain over a defined period. In many patients with persistent somatic and/or pain complaints, unrecognized psychiatric diagnoses drive or complicate symptoms and may precede the onset of low back pain. Mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders are common and can be associated with physical and pain complaints. Somatic symptoms often are the core feature of the depressed patient who presents to a primary care physician. Somatoform disorders are a spectrum of psychiatric disorders in which physical complaints are driven or aggravated by psychological factors; somatizing patients have chronic problems, many of which are pain-related and involve recurrent physical symptoms, often in different bodily systems, that wax and wane over time. Physicians who evaluate patients with pain complaints must understand the complexity of the challenge, including the probability that pain complaints indicate underlying psychopathology.",

      "abstract": "The risk of suicidal behaviour in mood disorders is an inherent severity of the depressive episode. Suicidal behaviour in patients with mood disorders is both state and severity dependent, which means that suicidality markedly decreases or vanishes after clinical recovery. However, since the majority of mood disorder patients never commit or attempt suicide, special clinical characteristics of the illness, as well as some personality, familial and psycho-social factors should also play a contributory role. This paper discusses the clinically explorable suicide risk factors in patients with major mood disorders, with particular regard to the underlying bipolarity. Successful acute and longterm pharmacotherapy - supplemented by psycho-social interventions - markedly reduces the risk of attempted and completed suicide, even in this high-risk population.

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

      "abstract": "Depression affects more than 300 million people worldwide. The condition is thought to result from a complex interaction of social, biological and psychological factors. It is characterised by persistent low mood, and/or loss of pleasure in most activities over a 2-week period. Depression can be further categorised into mild, moderate and severe depression. In adults over the age of 65 years, depression tends to be as a result of comorbidities. There are various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments available for the condition. In the primary care setting, it is important to ensure that the patient is followed up regularly. Research into the various pharmacological treatment options is most welcome in improving care for patients suffering from depression.",

      "title": "Treatments in depression",
      "abstract": "Major depression is believed to be a multifactorial disorder involving predisposing temperament and personality traits, exposure to traumatic and stressful life events, and biological susceptibility. Depression, both unipolar and bipolar, is a \"phasic\" disease. Stressful life events are known to trigger depressive episodes, while their influence seems to decrease over the course of the illness. This suggests that depression is associated with progressive stress response abnormalities, possibly linked to impairments of structural plasticity and cellular resilience. It therefore appears crucial to adequately treat depression in the early stages of the illness, in order to prevent morphological and functional abnormalities. While evidence suggests that a severely depressed patient needs antidepressant drug therapy and that a non-severely depressed patient may benefit from other approaches (ie, \"nonbiological\"), little research has been done on the effectiveness of different treatments for depression. The assertion that the clinical efficacy of antidepressants is comparable between the classes and within the classes of those medications may be true from a statistical viewpoint, but is of limited value in practice. The antidepressant drugs may produce differences in therapeutic response and tolerability. Among the possible predictors of outcome in depression treatment, those derived from clinical assessment, neuroendocrine investigations, polysomnographic sleep parameters, genetic variables, and brain imaging techniques have been extensively studied. This article also reviews therapeutic strategies used when initial treatment fails, and describes briefly new concepts in antidepressant therapies such as the regulation of disturbances in circadian rhythms. The treatment of depressive illness does not stop with treatment of acute episodes, and has to be envisaged as a continuous therapeutic intervention, of which we are still not able to determine the optimal duration of treatment and the moment that it should be ceased.",

Psychological stress has a negative impact over physical, mental and social well-being of a person. It has been suggested to play an important role in causation or precipitation of multitude of medical and dental problems ranging from serious heart diseases, cancers, gastrointestinal diseases, to common headaches, migraine, recurrent oral ulcerations, burning and dry mouth. In order to better understand the role of stress, valid and reliable measurement of stress is of utmost importance. Since, most of methods used for the diagnosis of stress are questionnaires form (subjective methods) which depend on person and there is many inter individual variation between subjects, thus there is increased need of biological stress markers to provide an objective, reliable and authentic evidence of stress. Self-reporting subjective questionnaire forms in stress evaluation and as psychological diagnostic mean provide highly inconsistent results according to patient’s mood and attitude. And this is because many individuals suffering from stress related problems have a tendency to either negate or exaggerate the real condition; which may lead to a deviation in the study and discompose the results. Thus there is a high need for studying the changes caused by stress in the human body to evaluate the usefulness of the bio physiological indicators or biomarkers to provide a reliable objective evaluation and assessment of a stress and psychologically related conditions. Salivary biomarkers are one of most widely researched area of interest because it might to provide a reliable, noninvasive and objective measurements of the response of the body, also because of easy and rapid collection of samples compared to the blood and urine samples thereby increasing the patient compliance.

      "title": "Depression: epidemic or pseudo-epidemic?",
      "abstract": "There are a number of under-examined fault lines running through the medical literature on depression, and current clinical practice in the UK. This chiefly stems from a too exclusively biomedical focus, neglecting the social construction of the human mind. For a start, the term `depression' tends to be used without qualification, as if it was settled that we were always referring to a free-standing biologically-based disorder. Yet in everyday usage, as much by doctors as by the general public, `depression' can mean something figurative or literal, can denote a normal or abnormal state, and if abnormal either an individual symptom or a full-blown disorder. And though depression-as-disease may have acquired the status of a natural science category, this was an achievement rather than a discovery: the history of the concept demonstrates the gradual incorporation of a Western cultural vocabulary of guilt, energy, fatigue and stress.1\r\n\r\nOrthodox teaching has been that a `functional shift', the presence of so-called biological features, points to medically significant depression (and responsiveness to anti-depressants). But, bar a small subset of severe cases, there is no reliable demarcation of depression from ordinary unhappiness or misery on this basis. Poor sleep and concentration, weight loss, reduced motivation and drive, anhedonia, etc. (as well as suicidal ideas), not uncommonly accompany ordinary misery as well.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, just before the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners began a Defeat Depression campaign, they surveyed lay people's attitudes to depression and its treatment.2 The views they elicited tended to portray depression in terms of emotional problems, like unhappiness, caused primarily by social and situational factors, and not something to take to general practitioners (GPs). Of the 2003 people polled, 78% saw anti-depressants as addictive, and liable to dull symptoms rather than solve the problem. The Royal Colleges seem to have been undeterred by these findings, which were rather at odds with their view of `depression' as straightforwardly connoting a psychiatric disorder. Indeed the Royal Colleges initiated the Defeat Depression campaign because they believed that 50% of people with depression did not consult their GPs. They wanted to increase this figure. But was the lay view wrong? We can see here how professional pronouncements can contribute to a blurring between unpleasant but commonplace mental states, part of life, and those associated with objective dysfunction and breakdown, meriting medical attention.\r\n\r\nThe other explicitly stated reason for the campaign was the belief that GPs often missed depression anyway. Since then the notion that there were large numbers of undiagnosed cases has been remarkably tenacious. Why? There is, in fact, no sound evidence for an epidemic of depression (as psychiatric disorder) in the UK. On the other hand, the case for an epidemic of antidepressant prescribing is now cast iron. In Britain prescriptions rose from 9 million to 21 million during the 1990s, and in the USA have doubled in only 5 years—mirroring the production and marketing of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressants.\r\n\r\nWhat remains striking is how unrobust the evidence base for antidepressants still is, particularly for the mild/moderate cases that account for the majority of all prescriptions.3 Part of the reason is surely that antidepressants will not cure human misery, whether presenting in primary care or in psychiatric clinics. Indeed many of those difficult cases described in psychiatric journals as having `treatment resistant depression' may be `resistant' precisely for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this repeatedly aired assumption about under-recognition at primary care level has itself led GPs to prescribe more readily. Further, some GPs prescribe for low mood per se, even if other features of the syndrome are absent, and the simpler dose regimens of SSRIs by comparison with tricyclics have helped. Patient feedback is influenced by placebo effects, and by factors like nonspecific sedation that have nothing to do with `antidepression'. People whose record indicates prior prescription of anti-depressants are more likely to be prescribed them again at a later time by other doctors. It remains to be seen if NICE guidelines—which do not recommend antidepressants as the primary intervention in `mild/moderate' cases, make a difference to these trends.4\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical promotion of SSRIs made much of the claim to have fewer side-effects than the tricyclics, and this contributed to the confidence with which GPs recommended them to patients. In view of the public concern about addictive effects evident in the survey described above, it is ironic that discontinuation reactions are now emerging as a distinct clinical problem (extending to litigation against doctors in the USA), both in SSRIs and in other new anti-depressants like venlafaxine.\r\n\r\nThe weak construct validity of psychiatric categories, and the dominance of empiricism over theoretical development, are overarching issues for the psychiatric profession.5 Both are apparent in the discourse about depression. So, too, is a lack of explicit reflection on the ideological and societally-framed nature of medical practice, which would need to take account of cultural shifts in attitudes to adversity and the emergence of an expressive, less stoical individualism.6 The surge in anti-depressant prescribing is as much a cultural trend as a medical one, reflecting the rise of a medicalization and professionalization of everyday life and its problems across Western societies.7\r\n\r\nThere is also an important international dimension. `Depression' is said to contribute 12% of the total burden of nonfatal global disease.8 The World Health Organization describes it as an epidemic that within two decades will be second only to cardiovascular disease in terms of global disease burden. But `depression' has no exact equivalent in non-Western cultures, not least because these do not share a Western ethnopsychology that defines `emotion' as internal, often biological, unintentioned, distinct from cognition, and a feature of individuals rather than situations.9 Non-Western peoples would tend to see the problem in situational and moral terms (as some Western citizens still do, as evidenced by the survey described above), though when they migrate to the West they become more likely to ascribe to a depression-as-disease model.10 This is to highlight the work of culture and its opinion formers—including the medical profession—in shaping a particular interpretation of the world.\r\n\r\nThus the use of Western-derived quantitative instruments to estimate population prevalences worldwide is likely to commit a category fallacy, which is the assumption that mental and bodily state phenomena mean the same thing in whatever setting they are detected. There is no such thing as depression, if by this we mean (as the WHO appear to mean) a unitary, universally valid, pathological entity requiring medical intervention. Such claims seem a serious distortion, one serving to deflect attention away from what millions of people might cite as the basis of their misery, like poverty and lack of rights. The one clear-cut beneficiary would be the pharmaceutical industry, with its vested interest in the biologization of the human predicament.",

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

      "title": "Application of the PRECEDE Model to Understanding Postnatal Depression.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fourth Edition (SM-IV-TR) postnatal depression (PND) is not currently recognized as a separate diagnosis. Instead, the DSM-IV-TR recognizes mood problems during the postnatal period using a postnatal onset specifier to several mood disorders including, major depressive, manic or mixed episode of major depressive disorder, bipolar i disorder, bipolar ii disorder and brief psychotic disorder (1).Postnatal depression, that is depression occurs in a mother within 6 weeks of her giving birth, can have profound effects upon the health and wellbeing of the mother, her baby and the family (2) characterized by a number of symptoms including core symptoms of depressed mood and/or loss of pleasure, together with additional symptoms, including changes in weight or sleep, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worth lessens or guiltiness, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation (3). Therefore, PND is a multifactorial disorder with biological, psychological, and sociological aspects interacting with woman's risk individually. In addition to the considerable negative personal impact that PND has on women, PND also negatively affects marital relationships (1). Mothers are fully active in their role, when they feel healthy, and the society considers them healthy. While, PND can be explained by clinical criteria and physical symptoms, social recognition is also effective in this area.PND may also detrimentally affect mother-infant attachment, and infant social and cognitive development. Depressed mothers are less emotionally sensitive and less attuned to their infant's emotional state. These serious implications make PND an important mental illness to study because of the tremendous impact it has on the mother and support system, including child's development and familial relationships (1). The ability of a woman to adjust to these changes affects herself, her infant, other children she may have, and her partner (3). Healthy People 2010 listed improve-ement of the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and families as goal (3).The first step in designing an educational program is selecting a health education model which starts the program on the right way and guides it to the evaluation phase. One of the frequently used models in health education and promotion is the PRECEDE model. We assessed the effectiveness of application of PRECEDE model on pregnant women for preventing PND. We hypothesized that predisposing, enabling and reinforcing would serve as antecedents to postnatal depression. Identifying preventive factors is considered an important step in treatment of PND. Predisposing factors, enabling and reinforcing factors are presented as underlying factors in PRECEDE model and addressing each of these factors by the individual and society plays an important role in prevention of this disorder.Therefore, this study investigated predisposing, enabling and reinforcing as factors that can prevent postnatal depression.The PRECEDE model has been widely applied in health promotion settings. Its main goals are to explain health-related behaviors and to guide the design of interventions that aim to change healthrelated behaviors, their antecedents, and their sequelae (4). The PRECEDE framework attempts to identify a type of education which results in certain changes and eventually leads to Prevented PND. The PRECEDE portion of the model (Phases 1-4) includes social, epidemiological, behavioral, environmental, educational, adminis-trative, and policy assessments. Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model has been developed by Green and Kreuter as a theoretical model to identify the needs of educational programs and health promotion (5). …",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

Patients attending emergency and unscheduled care settings with acute or chronic mental health conditions are common presentations. Many environments use mental health assessment matrix that assists with identifying risk and urgency for non-mental health trained clinicians. The assessment should identify: presenting problem; social circumstances; current or previous treatment; current or past engagement with mental health services; current medication; and alcohol or drug use. Acute confusion (delirium) involves abnormalities in the patients thought, level of awareness and perception. The incidence of delirium is higher in those patients with a pre-existing cognitive impairment. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of severe anxiety and fear sometimes without warning. The cause may be easily identified and relate to an existing fear or phobia, but panic attacks can also occur for no apparent reason.",

      "title": "Molecular and Genetic Basis of Stress",
      "abstract": "A person’s reaction to trauma depends on the traumatic situation itself, personality characteristics of the person exposed to trauma, and posttraumatic social environment. Stressor must be extreme event that is extremely dangerous or fatal nature, and which is outside normal human experience [1]. Studies investigating psychological consequences of military and civil trauma confirmed the correlation between the nature and intensity of trauma, previous traumatic experience, and psychological consequences. Stress causes the autonomic nervous system hyperactivity. If the stress is extreme or constant symptoms of hyperactivity, increased heart rate, increased respiration, sweating, muscle tension, insomnia and increased anxiety are becoming significant for the prolonging the symptoms of PTSD. Our cells are well adapted to exposure to a mild stress for a short time. In contrast there are potentially serious consequences of exposure to the prolonged stress[2]. Various damages arising from the war in Bosnia (1992 - 1995) are almost undetectable, and the consequences for the mental health of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina are long and painful. It is estimated that in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are 1.75 million people who have some stress-related mental disorders, of which 1 million in the Federation. PTSD may be represented by mutations that must be carried by many genes. There may even be epigenetic reasons for the disorder that have nothing to do with heritable mutations per se. Epigenetic means related to functional changes in the genome that can be regulated by external environmental events that do not involve alterations in the genetic code. One epigenetic mechanism is called “methylation,” a molecular process that affects the activity of a large percentage of genes. Epigenetic investigations say that methylation may be involved in the development of stress regulation in early life[3]. A number of longitudinal studies have looked at independent variables spanning the entire course of the illness. A 10-year follow-up study in Holocaust survivors clearly demonstrated decline in stress hormone levels for those patients in whom PTSD developed or in whom PTSD was chronic. No such decline was shown for those survivors who did not present with PTSD. Indeed, they showed a relative increase in hormone levels [4]. Hippocampal volume has also been studied (using the same types of experiments as the twin studies described previously). Hippocampal volume can be quite variable. It can change as a result of environmental exposure, duration of certain illnesses, and even the age of the subject. As noted, shrunken hippocampal volume has been shown in PTSD patients, but most of these are younger cohorts. When one examines PTSD in older cohorts, the differences in volume evaporate, and no linkage with disease is observed [5]. Microarray analysis is a powerful way to look at global gene expression profiles in tissues which can identify relevant molecular processes. On that way we have enough tools on hand to find the genes responsible for the disorder. Studying such genes can lead to creating effective treatments, including designing medications that are not only specific to the disorder but also specific to an individual’s experience with the disorder.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia syndrome: Basic knowledge, diagnosis and treatment.",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep and mental/physical fatigue. Most patients report additional somatic and psychological symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a heterogeneous condition. The definite aetiology of this syndrome remains unknown. A model of interacting biological and psychosocial variables in the predisposition, triggering, and development of the chronicity of fibromyalgia symptoms has been suggested. Depression, genetics, obesity combined with physical inactivity, physical and sexual abuse in childhood, sleep problems, and smoking predict future development of fibromyalgia. Psychosocial stress (working place and family conflicts) and physical stress (infections, surgery, accidents) might trigger the onset of chronic widespread pain and fatigue. Mental disorders have a negative impact on the clinical outcome. Several factors are associated with the pathophysiology such as alteration of sensory processing in the brain, reduced reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress, increased pro-inflammatory and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles, disturbances in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, and small fiber pathology. Prolonged exposure to stress, as outlined above, may contribute to these functional changes in predisposed individuals. The prevalence in the general German population is about 2 %. The clinical diagnosis is established by the history of the key symptoms and the exclusion of somatic diseases sufficiently explaining chronic widespread pain. For management, the German evidence and consensus based guideline recommends a stepwise approach according to the severity of FMS. All patients should receive adequate education about the disorder and its management. Non-pharmacological therapies such as low intensity aerobic exercise and meditative movement therapies such as Qi-Gong and Yoga are highly recommended for long-term self-management. Drug therapy is not mandatory. Recommended drugs are the antidepressants amitriptyline and duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin which act as pain modulators.",

      "title": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN",
      "abstract": "In the holistic approach in medicine а person is viewed through the bio-psycho-social model. Human health is a trinity of “soma” (body), “psyche” (soul) and social role (position) that are constantly interacting with each other and with the environment. Any action on one of the dimensions inevitably affects the others. Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. They cause social, economic and psychological burden for individuals, their families and the whole society. Much of the socially significant diseases (especially cancer and degenerative diseases) are associated with chronic pain. Epidemiological data shows that between 10.1% and 55.2% of people in different countries suffer from chronic pain. Pain has been shown to affect all dimensions of health related to quality of life. Patients with chronic pain also suffer from depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Limitation of physical activity leads to overweight and all additional health risks related to this condition. Depression, inability to work, impaired social contacts and suicidal thoughts make chronic pain a public health problem. Drug medication along with psychological support and social commitment are important elements of holistic integrated care for patients with chronic pain.The purpose of this article is to analyze the ethical considerations of integrative care for patients with chronic pain.In modern medical ethics autonomy is basic principle. In bioethics autonomy means “the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision for your health”. To participate in the decision-making process patients, need sufficient and comprehensive information. The right to information is a basic patient’s right and obligation of the physician. The partnership model is of great importance in the treatment of chronic diseases. The patient is engaged as part of the therapeutic team, actively participates in the healing process and implements self-management of the disease. Numerous studies have proven that patient involvement improves medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in healthcare. The communication between the doctor and the patient is a cornerstone and a premise for quality medical care.In conclusion, in the age of high-tech medicine, the human factor and patient-centered care have remained intact. Good awareness of patients is of key importance for their participation in the treatment. Easily available, true and relevant information is a prerequisite for understanding the pain control options.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

However, the physiotherapist often detects physical signs in these patients: changes in posture, holding breath, tense and hard musculature, and poor balance. The findings are dependent on what is being sought. The view of the body as ambiguous, as something a person has and is, can shed light on the way life has left its traces in the body, such as changes in posture and poor balance. In this article it will be argued that combining a physiotherapeutic, a phenomenological, and a biological perspective can make chronic muscular pain more comprehensible.

However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines on cognitive impairment in bipolar disorders – Assessment and management",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Bipolar disorder (BD) affects about 0.5% of the Indian population.[1] Individuals with BD experience residual symptoms between episodes and manifest significant functional and cognitive impairments, even during remission. Patients with BD show notable cognitive impairment across all clinical states, including euthymia, even when potential confounding factors like demographic variables, medication effects, and residual depressive symptoms are controlled for.[2] Neurocognitive deficits are not only a persistent aspect of the illness but also postulated to be a fundamental primary characteristic, rather than a result of the mood state or medication.[3] A significant and widespread neurocognitive deficit reportedly exists even before the first onset of mood symptoms, persists through various phases, and often deteriorates as the illness progresses.[4–6] Cognitive functioning is a key predictor of occupational functioning in BD and may exert a greater influence than other clinical factors. Considering the widespread and negative psychosocial impact of cognitive dysfunction in the illness, it is crucial to utilize appropriate cognitive measures to enhance our understanding of the nature, severity, and correlates of cognitive deficits in the illness and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to address this cognitive impairment in BD. PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES A thorough literature search was conducted using the key words/MeSH terms neurocognition, cognitive function, cognitive deficits OR executive functions OR working memory, cognitive domains AND bipolar disorder, mania, and bipolar depression. The 1643 articles that were returned were scrutinised for relevance. In addition, the Medline search returned about 63 systematic reviews and 46 meta-analyses on the search terms neurocognition and bipolar disorder. The articles were then screened for relevance on the title and abstract. The ones that were more recent were included in the review on the understanding that they would include the previous articles. Search for Indian literature using the same search terms returned about 30 articles, most of which have been included in this guideline. Weightage was given to meta-analysis where available. The manuscript has been organised in a manner that would provide good flow for the reader, including what is the evidence available including social cognition, what assessments are possible, time taken for each assessment, what are the treatment options investigated and which of these are feasible in clinical practice. A flow chart is incorporated to highlight the same. COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BD – EVIDENCE SO FAR To understand cognition in BD, let us try to answer a few questions that commonly arise when we talk about cognition in this group of patients. Are cognitive deficits present in BD? Many studies have supplemented the clinical observation that not all BD patients have cognitive deficits. Three distinct cognitive subgroups have been identified in BD subjects in remission – those with intact cognition, those with selective cognitive impairment, and those with global cognitive impairment (Burdick, 2014; Lima, 2019).[7,8] These differences remained over a 5-year longitudinal course, thereby further highlighting that cognitive deficits in BD could represent a significantly heterogeneous group (Elhrich, 2022)[9] and the cognition remained intact in the high-performance group relative to healthy subjects. Cognitive heterogeneity is now being increasingly recognized, and the cognitive trajectory of BD is a subject of scholastic debate and enquiry (Van Rheenan, 2020).[10] Despite this, there is a consensus that not only the performance on neurocognitive tasks in nearly every major domain is disrupted during manic, depressed, or mixed phases of BD but also the deficits persist even in euthymia. Studies have noted that in euthymic BD, domain-specific deficits have been demonstrated in attention, verbal learning memory, and executive functions.[11] Attention is a complex neurocognitive domain with several subcomponents and is essential to all higher cognitive functions. Sustained attention is impaired in BD in all phases of the illness, and these impairments do not remit completely during euthymia. Selective attention deficits present in the acute episodes also persist during euthymia.[12] Verbal immediate and delayed recall is also impaired in remitted BD. Executive function deficits are the most consistent neurocognitive deficit reported in euthymic BD in different aspects of executive function like planning, set-shifting, cognitive control, and verbal fluency.[12–14] In summary, multiple investigations have consistently provided evidence of neurocognitive deficits in individuals with BD across all clinical stages, including euthymia. These impairments have been found to have moderate to high effect sizes. Deficits in verbal memory and certain aspects of executive functioning seem to be more pronounced compared to other cognitive domains. The findings of various studies are summarized below [Table 1].Table 1: Summary of studies on cognitive deficits in BDAt what stages are cognitive deficits noted? At what stage in the course of the illness do cognitive deficits occur, does illness progression has an impact on the progression of the cognitive deficits, and what is the potential for intervention at each stage are some questions that are of clinical relevance. Some studies (individual and reviews/meta-analyses) have evaluated cognitive deficits in the different stages of BD and the correlation between illness progression and the progression of cognitive deficits. The individual studies are mostly cross-sectional though longitudinal studies would be more informative. Most of these studies have reported that cognitive deficits are present from the very early stages, that is, even in the first-degree unaffected family members also, and these are more pronounced after the onset of the first episode. A recent study by Reddy et al., 2023 done at NIMHANS also showed similar results.[19] A study done at NIMHANS[20] that evaluated cognition across stages of BD also noted that those with a higher number of episodes, especially more than three manic episodes, show higher deficits than those with one or two episodes. Some of these studies are summarized below [Table 2].Table 2: Summary of studies on cognitive deficits across stages of BDAre there distinct cognitive subgroups of BD? Some of the studies have attempted to investigate this question. Bora (2018) examined the impact of a history of psychotic characteristics and full manic episodes on neurocognitive performance. The results showed that those with a history of psychotic symptoms and individuals with a history of full manic episodes, that is, BD-I, had slightly more severe cognitive deficits. BD-I significantly underperformed BD-II in global cognition, verbal memory, and processing speed. Psychotic BD was associated with significantly impaired cognition in global cognition verbal memory processing speed, EF speed, EF accuracy, working memory, and social cognition.[26] Studies have also attempted to see the difference between BD I and BD II, and they reported similar cognitive profiles. A recent systematic review reported similar cognitive profiles in BD I and BD II.[27] Lima et al.in 2019 did a hierarchical cluster analysis to investigate the presence of discrete neurocognitive subgroups using a neurocognitive battery as the basis for classification. The Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA) and Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) were employed to evaluate self-reported cognitive challenges and the extent of functional impairment. The study delineated three distinct subgroups: The first comprised individuals with normal cognitive function (43.5%), the second included individuals with specific cognitive impairments (33.3%), and the third encompassed individuals with overall cognitive impairments (23.3%). The intact group had significantly greater levels of schooling and higher estimated IQ compared to both the generally and selectively affected groupings. Furthermore, they received a diagnosis of BD at an earlier age and underwent their initial hospitalization at a younger age than individuals with general cognitive impairment. Evidence supports the presence of a spectrum of severity ranging from patients without any impairment to those with significant cognitive dysfunction. Patients in the intact group exhibit a greater level of cognitive reserve compared to the other two groups. Nevertheless, they also encountered cognitive grievances and a certain level of functional debilitation.[8] These findings indicate that it is crucial to utilize a combination of tools, such as objective and subjective cognitive measures along with functioning instruments, in order to fully evaluate patients with BD. The above studies suggest that we definitely need a better understanding of the determinants of cognitive deficits in BD patients. Let us discuss these determinants in further detail.DETERMINANTS OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BDASSESSMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS The assessment of cognitive deficits can be outlined in two steps: Screening for cognitive deficits Evaluation of cognitive deficits Like schizophrenia, where researchers have developed cognitive batteries like the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), researchers working on cognition in BD have developed screening tools that can identify cognitive deficits in BD. Before we screen the patient for cognitive deficits, assessment of the baseline IQ is very important. Screen patients when they are in remission (currently euthymic). Clinicians can use the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence® - Second Edition (WASI®-II) to assess the IQ. The WASI is intended to provide estimates of verbal and performance intelligence consistent with previous Wechsler tests in addition to measuring general, or full scale, intelligence.[36] The screening tools that have been validated for use in BD are listed below [Table 3].Table 3: Screening Tools for Cognitive Deficits in Bipolar DisorderAmong the computer-based tests, THINC-IT takes less time (15 minutes) when compared to ICAT (35 min), but THINC-IT is validated only for bipolar depression and has poor psychometric quality, so ICAT is a better screening instrument. Among the paper–pencil screening tests, COBRA takes 10 minutes and is a self-report-based test, whereas SCIP takes 15 minutes is a clinician-assessed, performance-based tool. The International Society of Bipolar Disorder (ISBD) formulated a task force to develop a consensus statement about the neurocognitive deficits in BD. This team reviewed various available cognitive batteries and the individual domain tests for their utility in BD.[41] ISBD Battery for Assessment of Neurocognition (ISBD-BANC) outlines the cognitive domains and neuropsychological tests relevant to BD. The NIMHANS neuropsychological battery which is validated for use in the Indian population has tests that can be used to assess the same cognitive domains [Table 4].Table 4: Proposed Cognitive Battery for Bipolar DisorderOut of the other cognitive batteries that could be relevant in BD but warrant further studies include: Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT) for testing inhibitory control, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery intradimensional ⁄ extradimensional (CANTAB-IDED) set-shifting task, Tower of London (and variants) for planning, inhibition, and working memory, Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) for decision-making/risk-taking, and Theory of Mind Advanced Test for Theory of Mind. Keefe et al. group also working on cognition in BD adopted the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BAC-S) scale for assessing cognition in BD and called it Brief Assessment of Cognition in Affective Disorders (BAC-A). This battery has been studied extensively and validated for assessing cognition in BD patients.[42] The tests included in the BAC-A battery are as mentioned in the below table [Table 5].Table 5: BAC –A SubtestsRecommendation: If cognitive impairment is suspected during clinical evaluation, initially screen and/or monitor the patient's cognitive performance using one of four instruments (THINC-it, ICAT, COBRA, and SCIP). If deficits are identified, then we can proceed to the next level of assessment, choosing between BAC-A and ISBD-BANC [Figure 1].Figure 1: Algorithm for the type of tests to be used for screening and assessing cognitive deficits in BDBAC-A takes 45 minutes, clinician-assessed, performance-based tests, and ISBD-BANC takes around 90 minutes, clinician-assessed, performance-based tests. Since BAC-A assesses a component of affective memory and emotional inhibition, also takes lesser time, it might be more feasible in clinical settings. SOCIAL COGNITION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER Social cognition (SC) is a discipline that seeks to understand how brain function facilitates the cognitive processes that underlie social behavior. It encompasses a range of intricate processes that enable us to engage in adaptive social interactions. These processes include representing internal bodily states, self and other knowledge, interpersonal motivations, and the ability to respond appropriately to socioemotional information.[43] The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has categorized five fundamental areas within this concept: Theory of Mind (ToM), Social Perception, Social Knowledge, Attribution Bias, and Emotion Processing (EP).[44] The theory of mind pertains to the capacity to comprehend and assign mental states, including beliefs, wants, and intentions, to oneself and others. Mentalizing talents are also referred to as the capacity for understanding and attributing meaning to mental processes in oneself and others. Attributional bias refers to the inclination to attribute the reason for occurrences to oneself, others, or the situation to understand social events and interactions. Emotional processing refers to the cognitive and psychological mechanisms involved in understanding and managing emotions. Emotional intelligence is the capacity to accurately observe and interpret facial expressions that convey emotions, as well as effectively utilize and regulate one's own emotions. Social perception refers to the process by which individuals interpret and understand the behavior, intentions, and characteristics of others in social situations. Social competence refers to the capacity to recognize, assess, and effectively utilize social cues to make accurate assessments about social roles, norms, connections, and the circumstances of others. Social knowledge, also known as social schema, is the understanding of the rules, objectives, and roles that define social circumstances and facilitate social interactions. Patients with euthymic BD experience a decline in ToM function, particularly in verbal ToM. Regarding ToM abilities in individuals with BD, there is a widespread observation of impairment during the acute periods of the illness.[45,46] However, the evidence of abnormalities in remission samples has been less compelling. The study of sociocognitive impairment in euthymic states is highly significant since these deficiencies can significantly hinder social reintegration and rehabilitation.[47] Considering the significance and influence of ToM performance on various aspects of life such as quality of life, social perception, and social behavior, it is crucial to conduct additional research on the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms behind these impairments. This research is necessary to identify specific areas to focus on in the development of personalized SC training for this particular population. A study conducted by Choudhary et al. in 2021[48] indicates that individuals with BD exhibit the lowest performance, while the HC (healthy controls) demonstrate the highest performance on the majority of SC (social cognition) tasks. Siblings, conversely, occupy an intermediate position between the patients and healthy controls for performance on all social cognition subtests, with the exception of the faux pas composite index and externalising bias, where siblings exhibited inferior performance compared to the patient group. Within the several areas of SC, the faux pas index, which reflects deficiencies in ToM, could potentially be explored as a potential endophenotype for BD. However, it is essential to replicate these findings with a larger sample size, undertake normalcy assessments for task performances, and analyze biomarkers to draw definitive conclusions from these results. In the overall population of patients with BD, there is no association between SC and demographic and clinical factors. Nevertheless, SC exhibits a notable correlation with neurocognition in both patients and siblings of patients with BD. Figure 2 presents the algorithm of approach to cognitive evaluation for BD patients.Figure 2: Algorithm of approach to cognitive evaluation in BD patientsMANAGEMENT OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BD Cognitive dysfunction has been linked to psychosocial dysfunction and reduced quality of life in individuals with BD. Secondary expenses associated with BD (such as unemployment and reduced workplace efficiency) present a significantly larger economic burden. There is a pressing need for procognitive treatment to enhance the functioning and quality of life in individuals with cognitive impairment in BD.[49] Below, we present the evidence from various trials that have looked at pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions [Tables 6 and 7, respectively].Table 6: Summary of pharmacological intervention study details and resultsTable 7: Summary Psychosocial and Other Biological Intervention Study Details and ResultsTo summarize the above findings at present, no intervention has shown strong, separate, and beneficial effects on cognitive function in adults with BD, as indicated by findings from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations. It is recommended to consider methodological concerns such as enriching the study population with persons who have pretreatment cognitive impairment and include those who are in remission. The field must also determine a cognitive measure that is thorough, with a little impact from repeated practice, and is capable of detecting changes as a dependent measure. Since we do not have any agent or therapy that can improve or reverse cognitive deficits in BD, it becomes important that we focus on intervening before these deficits set in, that is, the prevention of cognitive impairment. This can be done first by identifying the mediators of the cognitive impairments and second by intervening early. The mediators of cognitive deficits of BD are educational attainment and premorbid intelligence quotient (proxy variables of cognitive reserve), clinical symptomatology (remission vs acute episode), subclinical depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms, bipolar diagnostic subtype, psychiatric or medical comorbidity, illness duration (chronicity), number of episodes, pharmacological treatment, and childhood adversity. The potential prevention strategies would be to prevent multiple episodes with effective pharmacotherapy and the implementation of psychoeducation programs, avoid concomitant medications that interfere with cognitive function, treat subclinical depressive symptoms, control comorbidity (mental and psychiatric), promote healthy habits and aerobic physical exercise, implement cognitive or functional remediation, prescribe adjunctive procognitive treatment, and use noninvasive brain stimulation techniques (TMS, tDCS) wherever indicated, early in the course of the illness, that is, after the first episode.[69] APPLICATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Early interventions in bd The early interventions can again be divided into two, one in the people who have developed the illness and are in the early course and second in those who are at high risk of developing BD. In BD patients in the early course of illness, the ISBD task force has given certain recommendations after a detailed systematic review. They recommend that the combination of psychological and pharmaceutical interventions may provide synergistic effects, although the most effective interventions or combinations for this specific group in the early stages are yet uncertain. They also suggest considering the potential benefits of lithium in reducing relapses in the early stages of illness, along with the data supporting the use of both medication and psychoeducation; it is important to assess the effectiveness of combining lithium and psychoeducation therapies in the early stages of illness. Based on the available evidence supporting the use of both medication and psychological treatments, individuals in the early stages of BD should be provided with the opportunity to receive safe and effective interventions.[70] Another systematic review that evaluated the efficacy of early intervention in high-risk individuals (with an affected FDR) concluded that existing studies provide limited data regarding the conversion to BD, which is the primary outcome measure in early intervention research. Conducting multicenter, prospective randomized studies with large sample numbers, confirmed familial risk, and a homogeneous group of participants would provide valuable insights into the impact of a single intervention. Several therapies with documented efficacy in treating mood episodes, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, atypical antipsychotics, and moderate physical exercise, should be considered for implementation in this particular population. It is important to carefully assess the ethical implications of providing antipsychotics to a high-risk group. Early intervention in the initial phases of a problem can help avoid the long-term impact of the disease and yield significant advantages in terms of both human wellbeing and economic considerations and will greatly contribute to the prevention onset of BD.[71] SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Many individuals with BD exhibit measurable cognitive impairment in all clinical phases, including euthymia, even after accounting for potential confounding factors such as demographic characteristics, drug effects, and residual depressed symptoms. This cognitive impairment affects all domains, although it is especially pronounced in verbal memory and executive functioning. Several studies provide evidence suggesting that lithium treatment has a slight detrimental effect on cognitive performance in a certain subset of people with BD who do not respond well to the medication. Valproate is linked to poorer cognitive function in comparison to other drugs used to stabilize mood, although the effect of second-generation antipsychotics on cognition is still uncertain. Existing research indicates that, in contrast to individuals with schizophrenia, the majority of people with BD exhibit cognitive abilities that are average or higher than normal prior to the onset of the disorder. Nevertheless, a portion of individuals with BD has below-average premorbid intellectual ability, suggesting that early neurodevelopmental issues may contribute to the development of BD in this specific group of patients. The available prospective studies do not provide evidence to support the notion of gradual cognitive loss in BD after the initial episode. In contrast, certain research indicates that patients may observe enhancements in cognitive performance through suitable treatment following the initial manic episode. Cognitive functioning plays a crucial role in predicting how well people with BD can do their everyday activities and work. Initial results from limited studies have indicated the potential cognitive-enhancing effects of behavioral interventions (cognitive remediation) as well as pharmacological interventions (erythropoietin, intranasal insulin, lurasidone, and mifepristone) and neurostimulation interventions (rTMS and tDCS). Conducting longitudinal studies on the neurocognitive functioning of individuals at high risk of BD can enhance our understanding of how neurocognitive impairment develops and progresses in BD. This knowledge can then be used to develop specific early intervention strategies that aim to prevent or slow down and potentially reverse cognitive decline. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant influence that cognitive abilities have on the overall functioning of individuals with BD. Therefore, future efficacy trials should also prioritize investigating the possible positive and negative effects of therapies on cognitive performance and functional outcomes.

One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail. These groups are compared with respect to libido and behavior involving erection, ejaculation, anxiety and avoidance.",

The stress-induced anhedonic-like state characterizes by hypothermia, hypercortisolemia, and hypermelatoninemia associated with disturbances in the circadian system. Mainly Per2 and Bmal1 demonstrate altered expression in the brain and liver: expression of Per2 is sensitive to stress and changes in Bmal1 mostly associated with depressive behavior. The Per1 expression is sustainable in maintaining the circadian rhythm. A normalization of the expression patterns is likely to be essential for the recovery from the pathological state. Depression is a high prevalent disorder. The number of incidents is rising due to changes in lifestyle. The symptomatology is inconsistent and it is difficult to agree on one hypothesis. The disturbances of the 24 h circadian rhythm may be a factor in the development of major depressive disorder. The molecular biology underlying a causal relationship between circadian rhythm and mood disorders is slowly being unraveled. However, many questions still need to be answered.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

Like depressive disorders, bipolar and related disorders feature recurrent episodes of altered mood that interfere with cognition and functioning. Like schizophrenia, bipolar disorders may be chronic conditions that often involve psychotic episodes and similar pathological features. However, bipolar disorders should not be considered to be part of a continuum between schizophrenia and depressive disorders. Although bipolar disorders have long been recognized as being separate psychiatric disorders, the past decade has brought significant advancements in knowledge of these conditions. New information is emerging regarding prevalence, genetics, and treatment, and this information is both directing and challenging our understanding of bipolar disorders in late life.",

      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

Irregular work hours, shift work, frequent work-related trips, working in a cold or noisy environment, and jet lag are also potent risk factors for workers. In addition, the chronic effects of psychological job strain, which can be concep- tualized by the job demand-control-support model, are related to cardiovascular disease. In this model, high job demand and low work control accompanied by low social support at work are the most harmful to health.

Bipolar disorder is primarily a disorder of brain functioning and is both recurrent and chronic. Medication is always a major, and sometimes the only, intervention for this disorder because of its demonstrated effectiveness. Still, the medicalization of bipolar disorder has tended to obscure the fact that it has an uncertain etiology and psychosocial risk influences. Research has continued to support hypotheses that there are psychological and social, as well as biological, components to the onset and course of the disorder. The person at times seems normal but at other times behaves in bizarre, even psychotic, ways. Persons afflicted with the disorder benefit from understanding and learning to cope with it. Psychoeducation has become a primary intervention for persons with bipolar disorder and their significant others. What follows is an overview of the disorder and material that can be useful in educating persons with bipolar disorder and their significant others.",

      "title": "Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction and myocardial protection from ischemia/reperfusion injury",
      "abstract": "Sepsis, bacteremia and inflammation cause myocardial depression. The mechanism of the dysfunction is not clearly established partly because dysfunction can be elicited by many different mechanisms which can all manifest in disruption of myocardial mechanical function. In addition the models of sepsis and bacteremia and inflammation may vary drastically in the sequence of the coordinated immune response to the inflammatory or septic stimulus. Patterns of cytokine expression can vary as can other responses of the immune system. Patterns of neurohumoral activation in response to the stress of sepsis or bacteremia or inflammation can also vary in both magnitude of response and temporal sequence of response. Stress induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system and humoral responses to stress have a wide range of intensity that can be elicited. The fairly uniform response of the myocardium indicating cardiac dysfunction is surprisingly constant. Systolic performance, as measured by stroke volume or cardiac output and pressure work as estimated by ventricular pressure, are impaired when myocardial contraction is compromised. At times, diastolic function, assessed by ventricular relaxation and filling, is impaired. In addition to the dysfunction that occurs, there is a longer term response of the myocardium to sepsis, and this response is similar to that which is elicited in the heart by multiple brief ischemia/reperfusion episodes and by numerous pharmacological agents as well as heat stress and modified forms of lipopolysaccharide. The myocardium develops protection after an initial stress such that during a second stress, the myocardium does not exhibit as much damage as does a non-protected heart. Many agents can induce this protection which has been termed preconditioning. Both early preconditioning (protection that is measurable min to hours after the initial stimulus) and late preconditioning (protection that is measurable hours to days after the initial trigger or stimulus) are effective in protecting the heart from prolonged ischemia and reperfusion injury. Understanding the mechanisms of sepsis/bacteremia induced dysfunction and protection and if the dysfunction and protection are the products of the same intracellular pathways is important in protecting the heart from failing to perform adequately during severe sepsis and/or septic shock and for understanding the multitude of mechanism by which the myocardium maintains reserve capacity.",

The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is particularly complex, resulting in lengthy delays between first presentation and initiation of appropriate therapy. Inappropriate therapy destabilises the course and outcome of the disease. Although the defining features of bipolar disorder are manic or hypomanic episodes, patients typically present for treatment of depression and commonly deny symptoms of mood elevation. A correct diagnosis can easily be masked by comorbidities, personality issues and complex phenomenology. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be assisted by: ➢ asking about symptoms of mania or hypomania in every patient presenting with symptoms of depression. ➢ recognising mixed states in which manic and depressive symptoms occur simultaneously. ➢ identifying the features of bipolar depression that distinguish it from unipolar depression. There is a risk of over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder among patients who are histrionic, show abnormal illness behaviour and/or have issues of secondary gain.",

The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed.

Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom.

Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis.

Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja. Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama.

Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

Yet it is vascular risk factors and the adverse effects of prescribed medication that are most amenable to intervention. Current atypical antipsychotics may offer neurological and cognitive benefits, but there is accumulating evidence of problems with weight gain, diabetes, lipid dysregulation, metabolic syndrome and sexual side effects.The physical health of patients with schizophrenia remains a concern. Yet the quality of medical and psychiatric care of patients with comorbid physical and mental health disorders has been shown to be unsatisfactory in several areas. We suggest that clinicians routinely assess and monitor physical health needs of patients with serious mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Disability is a multifactorial phenomena in chronic pain disorders, as it is for other painful and nonpainful medical conditions. Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

      "abstract": "Depression often develops on a background of somatic and neurological conditions, but the relationship and mutual influence of these disorders can be different. Depression can be exogenous-organic in the context of somatic and neurological diseases; it can be a nosogenic reaction to the disease. In somatic and neurological patients, endogenous depression can be observed as a comorbid depressive episode of a recurrent depressive disorder or a bipolar affective disorder. However, patients' somatic complaints often mask the psychopathological picture of the depression and make its diagnosis more difficult. Conversely, depression can trigger or aggravate somatic condition via psychosomatic mechanisms, which is of great importance for the care providers of these patients. To illustrate the above, we present a clinical observation in which a patient with a history of two traumatic brain injuries with subsequent hospitalizations, long-term alcohol abuse, hepatitis B and C, accompanied by antiviral therapy, was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder (current episode – depressive hypochondriacal). Difficulties in the diagnosis of depression, aetiopathogenetic and therapeutic aspects are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person ‐ like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatisation of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

Emotional disturbances may mask these subtle problems, but they can also result from them. Clinical experience indicates that these problems are more apt to become stressful when the patient misinterprets or copes ineffectively with them. That these common problems of brain injured adults may be overlooked in the usual clinical examination was shown in a comparison of clinical records of 50 patients referred for neuropsychological consultation with records of 46 patient-participants in a longitudinal neuropsychological study. Significantly more reports of these problems appeared in the latter group of records. However, consultation records did reflect emotional distress. Irritability, depression, or anxiety affected all but six consultation patients and appeared with equal frequency among working patients as among those unable to work or needing full-time care. This suggests that some of their emotional distress resulted from less obvious problems than those impairing mobility, strength, or competency. Counseling can reduce the patient's vulnerability to the psychologically crippling effects of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue. Specific recommendations for patient and family counseling are offered.",

The name given varies—“endogenous depression”, “manic-depressive psychosis/depressive type”, “melancholia” or “depressive illness”. The present generation of laymen (not to say some psychiatrists) use the word “depression” so freely in order to describe an unpleasant, unhappy mood, whether lasting or transient, that one may prefer the term melancholia, or at least “depressive illness”, to signify that condition which justifies the number 301.1. The adjective “endogenous” implies for many that environmental stress plays little or no part in the onset of the illness; we cannot accept that this is always so. The term “reactive” is used in several ways, generally to indicate that the state of unhappiness arises out of some external circumstance and that it would end when circumstances improved or the individual accepted the realities of practical life. The patients used in the present study were suffering from an illness of a kind which we believe may sometimes develop in the absence of severe environmental stress, while in others it may be clearly provoked by circumstances, but the illness, as it develops, may take on a form which becomes largely independent of the environmental circumstances and may continue even when the provoking factors are past; it has become an autonomous melancholia. It will be apparent that by autonomous melancholia we mean an illness shown by clinical experience to respond especially well to electroplexy.",

Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions.

Most patients with PD first seek treatment in emergency room or general practice settings. In the overwhelming majority of cases, PD patients present with primarily somatic symptoms, many of which are common to medical illnesses. It is, therefore, not surprising that PD is often misdiagnosed and that patients with this disorder often spend years seeking treatment and undergoing costly and unnecessary tests and medical consultations before receiving a correct diagnosis. Better diagnosis and treatment of PD to achieve remission and prevent relapse has the potential to reduce the burden of this illness to the individual and society.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Cerebrovascular diseases cause a high percentage of disability and mortality among the population. Stroke, by importance and frequency, ranks first in neurological diseases, and third in mortality after cardiovascular and malignant diseases. Disability of survivors is up to 50%. Hemiplegia is а complete paralysis on one side of the body, crosswise to the damaged side of the brain hemisphere. Most common reason for hemiplegia is stroke. General symptoms include vomiting, headache, loss of consciousness up to coma, meningitic syndrome. Clinical picture of hemiplegia is develops through several stages. First stage is flaccid or and lasts 10-14 days. The second stage is chronic or spastic and happens at 2-3rd week after the stroke. The cerebrovascular stroke is diagnosed by obtaining a medical history in which dominates longlasting headache, loss of consciousness and high blood pressure. Another method of diagnose is CT. On the other hand, MRI is sensitive and selective method. It can detect vascular malformation (aneurysm). The rehabilitation should start as soon as possible in order to prevent: contractures, decubitus or other skin damage. Depending of the patients improving,we start improving the quality of daily activities: dressing, using phone feeding, personal hygiene etc. Therefore, the role of the physiotherapist in hemiplegic patient’s life is very important because he has to work with the patient completely dedicated from the earliest to the final stage of the rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Interest in the distinction between positive and negative symptoms has reached a peak in the last decade and has led to research in different fields; like phenomenology, ethiopathogenesis, treatment, course and outcome. Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic illness is a clinical concept used to define medically unexplained somatic symptoms considered to express psychological distress. Functional somatic illness may express underlying psychiatric disorders (e.g. fibromyalgia due to non-fearful panic disorder, irritable bowel syndrome due to bipolar disorder). Sustained physiological activation caused by stressful life events combined with catastrophic thinking may be another cause. Functional somatic illness may also be caused by classic conditioning of physiological responses that may have been triggered by biological or emotional stimuli. Operant conditioning may also be a cause. The therapeutic alliance relies on acceptance of the reality of the subjective complaints, without a priori acceptance of the patient's attribution of the cause of the symptoms. We recommend initial exploration of the patient's own ideas about aetiology, including appropriate medical tests. The physician should then change the agenda to a biopsychosocial perspective and identify current stressors and psychosocial variables that reinforce symptoms. Only a few randomised trials have been performed. They suggest that psychological treatment should be systematic and structured, with a focus on information, alternative ways of perception, and problem solving. Active forms of physiotherapy and psychopharmacological drugs may be of some benefit in selected patients.",

      "abstract": "A number of studies have revealed that perceived emotional stress can produce various transient cardiovascular responses. The reactions may include changes in heart rate and cardiac output. They may include abnormalities in heart rhythm, changes in blood pressure, peripheral resistance, blood viscosity, blood clotting time, and serum cholesterol levels. A hypothesis suggested by the findings which requires further research follows: If these cardiovascular responses were sustained for a period of time, they would ultimately influence the onset or course of coronary artery disease. These studies also suggest that emotional tension at one's work may place an additional strain on an already diseased heart. In patients whose cardiovascular system is already impaired, investigators have traced the sequence from emotional upset to heart disease. Since the reported evidence has been based on cardiac subjects, it is still possible that \"gradual increase in tension\" is perceived only after illness occurs, but not necessarily perceived as stressful before beart disease. Owing to the lack of prospective studies in which the life stress factors are studied prior to heart disease, emotion as a cause or contributory factor to heart disease has not been fully accepted. These studies suggest that certain personality traits may be common to certain forms of heart disease. Most of this evidence has been observed from time-consuming, detailed personality analysis, and the evidence depends on studies of relatively few patients and poor or no controls. It is important to note that these studies on personality type and heart disease were conducted after heart disorders developed. This raises the question of whether the reported personality characteristics preceded or followed the heart disease. The investigations to date assume that the personality structure occurred before the appearance of the heart disease, but before we can answer this question, a longitudinal study of the personality of individuals prior to cardiovascular disease would be necessary.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

The one-sided ideational context permeates interpersonal relations, intensifies family conflict and drains a considerable portion of available psychic energy. Disregard or an incorrect approach to this factor may result in painful therapeutic failure, since no exploratory psychotherapy or verbal intervention technique will be able to penetrate the monoideistic armour. THe continuous repetition of the dominant idea functions as a cumulative suggestion stimulus leading to disruption of spontaneous processes and self-defeating thinking, behavioral, motivational, and affective changes.

      "title": "Chronic Pain: What Does It Mean? A Review on the Use of the Term Chronic Pain in Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Chronic pain is nowadays used as an umbrella term referring to a wide range of clinical conditions, such as fibromyalgia, migraine, or long-standing pain states without actual known causes. However, labeling a patient's clinical condition with the term \"chronic pain\", when dealing with pain lasting longer than 3 months, might be misleading. This paper aims at analyzing the possible pitfalls related to the use of the term \"chronic pain\" in the clinical field. It appears, indeed, that the term \"chronic pain\" shows a semantic inaccuracy on the basis of emerging scientific evidences on the pathogenesis of different long-standing pain states. The major pitfalls in using this label emerge in clinical settings, especially with patients having a biomedical perspective on pain or from different cultures, or with healthcare providers of other medical specialties or different disciplines. A label solely emphasizing temporal features does not help to discern the multifaceted complexity of long-standing pain states, whose onset, maintenance and exacerbation are influenced by a complex and interdependent set of bio-psycho-social factors. Thus, finding a more meaningful name might be important. We call upon the necessity of bringing awareness and implementing educational activities for healthcare providers, as well as for the public, on the biopsychosocial approach to assess, prevent and care of chronic pain. Further research on the etiopathogenetic processes of chronic pain states is also required, together with examinative diagnostic methods, to individuate the most appropriate label(s) representing the complex long-standing pain states and to avoid adopting the term \"chronic pain\" inappropriately.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is an important unwanted phenomenon of psychotropic medications.This is often underreported and not given due importance, which can often lead to impaired quality of life and less-than-optimal medication compliance.All types of psychotropic medications are linked to sexual side effects.As the underlying mental disorder improves, some of the sexual issues abate, but treatment-related sexual adverse effects may persist over time and are unfortunately underrecognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials.When it comes to sexual dysfunction due to psychiatric disorders, there are two important things to understand.First, any mental illness can cause sexual dysfunction, and second, severer the underlying psychiatric disorder, severer is the sexual dysfunction (in both frequency and severity).Even though patients may be suffering from mental illnesses of variable severity, it is important for them to have a normal and enjoyable sex life.The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction found with antidepressant medication varies considerably between different studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence.The sexual problems encompass a range of sexual disorders and include decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, and erection or delayed ejaculation problems.Patients with sexual disorders usually also have anxiety disorder and vice versa; also, women with sexual dysfunction are more prone to anxiety and depression compared with others.This happens because sex steroids and the various neurotransmitters modulate both sexual function and mood.The mechanism by which psychotropic medications affect the sexual cycle is through the interaction between medications and the various abovementioned neurotransmitters.Physicians should monitor their patients for antidepressant-induced sexual adverse effects, as these may affect compliance with therapy and the ultimate treatment success.Sexual function should be actively assessed at regular intervals.Management of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires an individualized approach.",

      "title": "Emotional deficiency and psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

There are treatment algorithms, depending on the severity of obesity, and a multi-component approach, including attention to psychological issues, is recommended regardless of the level of obesity. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is beneficial in assisting with stimulus control, self-monitoring of lifestyle changes, goal-setting, and restructuring negative and self-defeating thoughts, and psychodynamic (insight-oriented) psychotherapy is useful in assisting with conflicts regarding excessive weight, body image, relationship to food and disordered patterns of eating, and dealing with the prejudice and overt discrimination obese patients may experience. Neither therapy is particularly effective alone and either and/or both may need to be continued indefinitely to avoid inevitable weight regain. Psychological intervention before and during the difficult process of dieting, as well as before and after bariatric surgery, is essential for some vulnerable patients. Since psychological factors are neither primarily etiological nor even necessarily predominant in obesity, the mental health professional plays an important, though adjunctive--\"psychotherapy-lite\" role--in treating obese patients.",

Peripheral vertigo is secondary to dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system and is usually characterized by an acute vertigo with loss of balance, sensation of spinning in the space or around self, and is exaggerated with changes of the head and body position; no other neurological deficit is present. Some medications may also cause vertigo. Depending on the cause of the vertigo, drugs with different mechanisms of action, physical therapy, psychotherapy, as well as surgery may be used to combat this disabling malady. Symptomatic treatment has a particularly important role, regardless of the etiology of vertigo.

Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

It incurs tremendous social and financial costs in the form of impaired relationships, lost productivity, and lost wages. Although chronic major depression is eminently treatable, it continues to be undertreated and underrecognized. This is particularly true in primary care settings, where physicians are usually the first to encounter chronic depression but are seldom trained to distinguish depression from other medical illnesses with similar symptoms. In addition, because of the stigma attached to depression, patients often characterize their symptoms as part of a physical illness or fail to report them to a clinician at all. This article discusses the epidemiology of depression, its impact and burden on society, and its special character (including diagnosis and treatment) as a chronic illness.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

Researches by the Barany methods, especially when these were complemented by necropsies with microscopic investigation, have furnished facts of importance in diagnostic symptomatology. First, the cause of vertigo, that symptom which so frequently confronts not only the neurologist and otologist, but also physicians at large, is often a perplexing problem. No matter where the primary seat of the affection which causes vertigo may be situated, whether in the stomach, kidney, liver, pancreas, tonsils, or the brain outside of the vestibular apparatus, the resulting toxemia, the abnormal nervous stimulus, or the cardiovascular disorder does not produce vertigo",

      "abstract": "In this chapter 'mental health problems' is used as an umbrella term, but 'mental illness' is sometimes used when discussing specific clinical diagnoses. Physical activity has been shown to have both preventative and therapeutic benefits for mental health. The mental health benefits of physical activity in the general population provide a rationale for therapeutic application in those with established mental health problems. Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for global mortality with sedentary behaviour now recognised as a major public health issue. The benefits of being physically active are well documented and include the prevention and management of mental health conditions. The chapter introduces the scale of the challenge that mental health problems pose, globally and in the United Kingdom (UK), in terms of health, health care provision, and the economic burden. The multiple benefits of physical activity for mental, physical, and social health, and the absence of side-effects, make it an appealing adjunct or alternative to pharmacological treatments.",

      "abstract": "The schizophrenia spectrum disorders are a group of psychiatric diagnoses that share several clinical features, typically involving reality distortion. Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys the idea that they are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "abstract": "Most studies of the course of schizophrenia cannot easily be compared because of differences in diagnostic criteria and measures of outcome. Both major clinical elements, the productive symptoms and the signs of deficit, seem in part to be reactive to the degree of stimulation in the psychosocial environment, though such factors by no means explain all their variability. The negative impairment tends to antedate florid onset and is a better predictor of social outcome than the florid symptoms. There is, however, no firm evidence that deterioration (deficit inevitably increasing with time) occurs. Manfred Bleuler's formulation summarises the overall outcome of a substantial part of what most clinicians who do not include a chronic course as part of the diagnosis call schizophrenia. About 20–25% recover, about 20–25% remain severely impaired throughout, the remainder run a fluctuating course.",

      "title": "The Role of Stress in the Pathogenesis and Maintenance of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often identify psychosocial stress as a factor that exacerbates their symptoms, and many trace the onset of symptoms to a stressful period of life or a discrete traumatic incident. However, the pathophysiological relationship between stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder remains poorly characterized: it is unclear whether trauma or stress is an independent cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, a triggering factor that interacts with a preexisting diathesis, or simply a nonspecific factor that can exacerbate obsessive-compulsive disorder along with other aspects of psychiatric symptomatology. Nonetheless, preclinical research has demonstrated that stress has conspicuous effects on corticostriatal and limbic circuitry. Specifically, stress can lead to neuronal atrophy in frontal cortices (particularly the medial prefrontal cortex), the dorsomedial striatum (caudate), and the hippocampus. Stress can also result in neuronal hypertrophy in the dorsolateral striatum (putamen) and amygdala. These neurobiological effects mirror reported neural abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder and may contribute to an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual behavior, an imbalance that is implicated in the pathogenesis and expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology. The modulation of corticostriatal and limbic circuits by stress and the resultant imbalance between habit and goal-directed learning and behavior offers a framework for investigating how stress may exacerbate or trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

      "abstract": "Loss is a common human experience, and grief is frequently seen in a physician's office. Grief occurs not only after a death, but also during chronic or serious illness, infertility, divorce, job changes, surgery, rape, and so forth. Some patients somatize distress, presenting with physical symptoms rather than acknowledging their grief. Bereavement increases the risk of both psychiatric and physical disease and can exacerbate pre-existing illness. In the majority, grief resolves normally, but in some the process becomes morbid. The family physician is in a unique position to identify, educate, assess, and intervene with the grieving patient and his family.",

PTSD has not been demonstrated to represent a unified construct such as that established for other validated psychiatric disorders identified in this text, but a developing knowledge base for PTSD is promising for future validation of this diagnosis. PTSD is an unusual diagnosis because of the conditional nature of this disorder that requires exposure to a traumatic event for consideration of the diagnosis. Individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event cannot meet criteria for PTSD. This feature of PTSD has created difficulties in applying this diagnosis in both clinical and research settings.",

In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs. The name “pseudoborderline syndrome” is proposed and it is speculated that masked affective disorders may appear in the form of “pseudo-syndromes”—pseudodementia, pseudomania, pseudohypochondriasis, pseudoborderline.",

For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

Neurochemical, existential, sociogenic, familial, pathological, psychodynamic and behavioural explanations have all been offered as putative reasons for the psychological disorder, which in its various representations (panic disorder, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, phobias, post‐traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorders, etc.) can affect up to 20% of the population on a lifetime basis (1). Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

A diagnosis is based on identifying the consistent symptoms with the exclusion of other organic or functional disorders having similar clinical presentations in a cost-effective manner. A physical examination should be performed on the first visit and on subsequent visits as needed. Two algorithms for the evaluation of patients seen in primary care settings and two other algorithms for patients presenting to gastroenterologists are presented. In general, if Rome II criteria are fulfilled, alarm features are not present, and screening studies from the referring physician are negative, further testing is not needed. Screening studies are recommended when certain historical information is present. In many cases, the therapeutic trial can be undertaken before further diagnostic studies are done and will depend on the symptom subtype and its severity. It needs to be emphasized that patients presenting with typical symptoms and no alarm signs are rarely found to have another diagnosis, supporting the benefit of ongoing care and symptomatic management rather than continued diagnostic evaluation. If initial treatment fails, or certain clinical features emerge requiring further evaluation, studies may be performed by gastroenterologists in specialty centers.",

Depression is characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, irritability, guilt, loss of interest, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, physical aches, and thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms can also include increased anger, restlessness, withdrawal, impulsivity, alcohol or drug use, isolation, and difficulties with sexual desire and performance. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common types of depression. It is characterized by changes in neuronal structure and function, which are accompanied by several biochemical changes.

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

This literature review of 25 studies will focus on the neurophysiology, and sensitivity of the nervous system after experiencing torture, the changes that happened at the brain level, and the pain system from a neuroscience point of view, and then the study will highlight the evidence-based practice for biopsychosocial intervention for torture survivors in treating chronic pain. The study findings and conclusion show that torture causes noticeable alterations to the brain and nervous system that manifest in the survivors as high PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, feelings of disempowerment, lack of control, personal boundaries being destroyed, or stress, with intermittent or continuous physiological hyperarousal. The classic fight-or-flight response to a perceived threat is a reflexive nervous phenomenon that has obvious survival advantages in evolutionary terms. When a person experiences severe circumstances like torture, which is often accompanied by intense fear, horror, and helplessness, the systems that organize the constellation of reflexive survival behaviors become dysregulated and hypersensitive like critical anatomical and neurophysiological alteration and chronic changes in the pain system, so, it’s mandatory for the rehabilitation team to understand these changes and create a setting that takes into consideration these experiences. Research on chronic pain aims to understand the various risks and protective influences of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that are known to contribute to chronic pain disorders after torture.",

Most often, illness refers only to the physical condition of the patient. At the same time, doctors do not pay special attention to the patient’s state of mind and his personal opinion regarding his health. However, taking into account the psychological individuality of the patient is important. Moreover, a negative psycho-emotional status has a strong impact on a person’s condition, which can manifest itself in the form of a decrease in the effectiveness of treatment, or even affect the level of quality of life.",

      "abstract": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

These symptoms will worsen with upright posture, movements, and exposure to complex visual stimuli. PPDD may be precipitated by disorders that impair balance or induce vestibular symptoms, such as peripheral or central vestibular diseases, other medical conditions, or psychological illness The exact pathophysiological mechanism is unknown, and it might result from functional adjustments to the postural control systems—alterations in the way multisensory information are processed or the integration of spatial orientation and danger perception in the cortex. PPPD is usually associated with co morbidities like anxiety. Subtypes of PPPD are phobic postural vertigo, space and motion discomfort, visual vertigo, and chronic subjective dizziness. PPPD is diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the Barany society. Physical examination and diagnostic investigation are not pathognomic to PPPD. Treatment approaches include patient counseling, vestibular rehabilitation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "Biological mechanisms underlying the role of physical fitness in health and resilience",
      "abstract": "Physical fitness, achieved through regular exercise and/or spontaneous physical activity, confers resilience by inducing positive psychological and physiological benefits, blunting stress reactivity, protecting against potentially adverse behavioural and metabolic consequences of stressful events and preventing many chronic diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical fitness on mental and physical health. Physical fitness appears to buffer against stress-related disease owing to its blunting/optimizing effects on hormonal stress responsive systems, such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. This blunting appears to contribute to reduced emotional, physiological and metabolic reactivity as well as increased positive mood and well-being. Another mechanism whereby regular exercise and/or physical fitness may confer resilience is through minimizing excessive inflammation. Chronic psychological stress, physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity have been associated with persistent, systemic, low-grade inflammation and exert adverse effects on mental and physical health. The anti-inflammatory effects of regular exercise/activity can promote behavioural and metabolic resilience, and protect against various chronic diseases associated with systemic inflammation. Moreover, exercise may benefit the brain by enhancing growth factor expression and neural plasticity, thereby contributing to improved mood and cognition. In summary, the mechanisms whereby physical fitness promotes increased resilience and well-being and positive psychological and physical health are diverse and complex.",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

In addition, PEs show associations with neuropsychological impairment and disturbances in brain structure and function. It is thought that PEs are driven by similar neurodevelopmental and environmental mechanisms, but it is unclear how similar the underlying pathways are. This chapter will discuss the cognitive difficulties and differences in brain structure and function associated with PEs. Then, it will examine these in relation to typical neurodevelopment and the course of impairment towards clinical psychotic disorders.",

      "title": "The effect of working conditions on cerebrovascular disease risk factors – a literature review",
      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases are socially significant diseases the morbidity and mortality rates of which have increased in recent years, including in working age adults. Due to increased workplace requirements or the nature of the work process, many workers have extended working hours, work overtime, or work in shifts. It impairs their health through a multifaceted mechanism and increases their risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and other diseases. Extended working hours and shift work increase the levels of occupational stress and chronic exposure leads to pathological changes, which may be risk factors for vascular diseases or worsen the control of such. Occupational stressors are a group of various workplace psychological, physical, and organizational failures which, combined with other family or socioeconomic stressors, impair the mental and physical health of the worker. Manual labourers most often exhibit harmful habits and decreased physical activity in their free time, which increases the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease. Overtime and shift work, despite contradictory data, are associated with the emergence of cerebrovascular disease risk factors. Their negative effect is most evident in patients with an already existing illness. Evidence is more definite about the negative effects of night-time work on hypertension, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia. Night shifts disrupt the secretion of melatonin, feeding and circadian rhythm, all of which lead to metabolic changes.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a pervasive and prevalent mental health disorder among prisoners, yet it frequently remains undiagnosed due to the phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing - a clinical bias where prominent conditions or contexts obscure less obvious mental health issues. This review explores diagnostic overshadowing as a key barrier to identifying depression in people in custody, focusing on diagnostic failures, their consequences, and solutions. We review global literature on depression prevalence, which affects prisoners at significantly higher rates than the general population, yet it is frequently misdiagnosed or goes unrecognized due to overshadowing by the more prominent features of substance use, challenging behaviours or the prison context itself. Failure to recognize readily treatable depressive disorders because of diagnostic overshadowing results in serious but avoidable consequences, including elevated suicide rates, increased recidivism, and other adverse outcomes such as substance abuse and institutional violence, which collectively and individually perpetuate the cycle of personal distress and dysfunction, as well as the human and associated costs to others in society. By describing and highlighting diagnostic overshadowing as a particular problem in correctional settings, and by exploring its mechanisms in correctional psychiatry settings, we advocate for solutions for more reliable recognition of depression in prisoners, which is an essential first step to effectively address this readily treatable but easily overlooked serious mental disorder.",

      "abstract": "While motor-system abnormalities are the defining features of PD, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms are of major importance.1,2⇓ Disturbances in mood and motivation, such as depression, apathy, anxiety, impulsivity, and mood lability, are particularly common. These behavior changes can be seen early in the course of PD and may antedate motor dysfunction, providing empirical evidence for an “organic” rather than reactive etiology. Postmortem and in vivo biochemical as well as neuroimaging studies lend support to this hypothesis, with mesolimbic dopamine and serotonin abnormalities and fronto-limbic dysfunction demonstrated in affected patient subgroups.3\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms can also begin later in the illness suggesting that additional factors, acting in concert with ongoing neurodegenerative changes, are important in their etiology. These factors include progressive and fluctuating motor symptoms, medication side effects, premorbid personality traits, psychosocial stressors, and the presence of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric comorbidity.4 It is not yet clear how these factors interact or which are most critical, a fact underscored by the absence of neurobehavioral signs in many patients with seemingly comparable disease features and risk factors.\n\nNonetheless, most neuropsychiatric syndromes are usually attributed to selective dysfunction of specific prefrontal and limbic cortical-striatal-thalamic pathways.5 This conceptual approach directly parallels strategies used to delineate physiologic and biochemic abnormalities mediating motor symptoms.6 Classic lesion-deficit studies support such links, with onset of depression, mania, …",

Major symptoms such as deficits in social reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, which are common in Developmental Disorders, strongly affect work performance. Some workers with Developmental Disorders suffer from other psychiatric conditions because of maladjustment to the work environment, while the manifestation of Developmental Disorders in workers is also influenced by the work environment. Occupational health staff should have sufficient of understanding of the difficulties and psychological suffering of such workers to be able to support their health and continuous employment. Support for mild cases as well as severe cases is sometimes difficult because it may give the impression of unfairness or cause a degeneration of morale among co-workers.

Psychosomatic factors should be given special attention during interviews. For a correct picture to be obtained, the help of a specially trained worker i.e. a psychiatrist or psychologist, should be enlisted. Factors and casual relationships can then be uncovered which remain problems to doctors not thus specialized. The two series dealt with in this study illustrate this clearly. Summarizing the observations made, Menière patients subjected to careful psychic and somatic analysis are found to have a predisposing psychosomatic constitution which, under chronic or acute stress, leads to such somatic manifestations as, in their turn, seem to presuppose a certain somatic predisposition—in this particular case evidently in the ear. Chronic stress seems to impair prognosis, a fact not difficult to understand considering that the mode of reaction depends upon the constitution, which—obviously—is of fairly permanent nature.",

      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

Although the effects of specific residual symptoms have not been as systematically studied, several symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and concentration difficulties, commonly occur as part of the residual state in MDD. In particular, the relatively high prevalence of residual fatigue suggests that this symptom is not being adequately addressed by standard antidepressant therapies. A review of the clinical relevance of residual fatigue was undertaken, using the published literature with respect to its assessment, neurobiology, and treatment implications. The findings of this review suggest that fatigue is highly prevalent as a residual symptom; its response to treatment is relatively poor or delayed; and the presence of residual fatigue is highly predictive of inability to achieve remission with treatment as well as impaired psychosocial functioning. Recognition of the significant consequences of residual fatigue should reinforce the need for further therapeutic interventions to help reduce the impact of this symptom of MDD.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "The scrutiny of this small group of patients, presenting a serious deterioration of insidious onset, reveals as outstanding factors the constitutional inadequacy of the individual patient and the unfavorable external factors which conditioned and frustrated him. Two of the patients developed pulmonary tuberculosis, but the clinical picture and course in these 2 patients were not markedly different from those of the other 7 patients. One may say that in this group the physical examination revealed no adequate cause for the onset of the deterioration. The clinical picture and course of the mental disorder in this group may be outlined as follows: The patient in adolescence or early adult life, without any adequate explanation in the way of physical illness or drastic change in the environment, begins to show a striking loss of sociability, initiative, interest and personal care. The course is as a rule steadily downwards, ending in a parasitic existence at a very low level. With the abeyance of the superior functions, with the loss of social response, of spontaneity, and of interest, there occur, perhaps as release phenomena, reactions of a lower neurological level—meaningless smiling and laughter, explosive outbursts of anger, occasional autoerotism, mannerisms and grimaces, automatic movements. Memory may be retained to a surprising extent; incoherence is frequently noted but the patient is uncommunicative. There is no special manifestation of basic urges, of underlying preoccupations, of repressed and dissociated factors. There seems to be a lack of vital energy associated with the egoistic as with the more complex social trends. The condition is one of defect rather than of conflict. In the comparative absence of tension, or turmoil, of compensatory strivings or phantasies, the clinical picture makes the impression of self-abandonment, of surrender, of acceptance of life at a lower automatic level. This surrender may be further evidence of the constitutional defect of vitality of the organism already indicated in childhood and made more manifest in face of the demands of the independent, mature, social life. The challenge of life to these underprivileged, poorly conditioned, and frustrated individuals is beyond their capacity. While others with somewhat different endowment react with hysterical or compulsive evasions, with affective slumps or sprees, with imaginative phantasies or regressive dramatisations, this group differently endowed reacts to the challenge with a simple surrender. If we continue to retain these patients within the hospitable group of schizophrenia, it may be legitimate to characterize their special type of reaction as schizophrenic \"surrender.\" In the further analysis of the conditions of this \"surrender\" the inadequacy or abiotrophy of component systems of the organism requires to be investigated and evaluated.",

It has a massive personal and socioeconomic impact, as it is a disease with high morbidity and mortality. Both young and old people are affected, as a result of traffic or sports accidents as well as due to falls at home. The term TBI encompasses various clinical pictures, differing considerably in cause, prognosis and therapy. What they all have in common is the pathophysiological cascade that develops immediately after the initial trauma and which can persist for several days and weeks. In this phase, medical treatment, whether surgical or pharmacological, attempts to reduce the consequences of the primary damage. The aim is to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and to reduce intracranial pressure.Das Schädel-Hirn-Trauma (SHT) bezeichnet eine durch äußere Gewalteinwirkung bedingte Schädigung des Gehirnparenchyms. Es verursacht massive individuelle und sozioökonomische Folgen aufgrund der hohen Morbidität und Mortalität. Betroffen sind junge Menschen durch Verkehrs- oder Sportunfälle, aber auch zunehmend alte Menschen durch Stürze im häuslichen Umfeld. Der Begriff SHT umfasst mehrere Krankheitsbilder, die sich in Ursache, Prognose und Therapie unterscheiden. Allen gemein sind jedoch komplexe pathophysiologische Kaskaden, die sich sofort nach dem initialen Trauma entwickeln und über mehrere Tage und Wochen anhalten können. In dieser Phase versucht eine medizinische Behandlung, sei sie chirurgisch oder medikamentös, die Folgen des Primärschadens zu reduzieren. Die Erhaltung eines adäquaten zerebralen Perfusionsdrucks und die Reduktion des Hirndrucks stehen im Vordergrund.",

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

The signs were associated with other clinical measures of illness behavior and distress, and are not simply a feature of medicolegal presentations. Despite clear caveats about the interpretation of the signs, they have been misinterpreted and misused both clinically and medicolegally. Behavioral responses to examination provide useful clinical information, but need to be interpreted with care and understanding. Isolated signs should not be overinterpreted. Multiple signs suggest that the patient does not have a straightforward physical problem, but that psychological factors also need to be considered. Some patients may require both physical management of their physical pathology and more careful management of the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of their illness. Behavioral signs should be understood as response affected by fear in the context of recovery from injury and the development of chronic incapacity. They offer only a psychological \"yellow-flag\" and not a complete psychological assessment. Behavioral signs are not on their own a test of credibility or faking.",

Until stress becomes severe there is no great danger, but as the onset of stress is usually a gradual process its warning signals are not easily recognized and may be easily misinterpreted. The symptoms of stress are many: irritability and frustration; altered sleep patterns despite increasing fatigue; laughter is less frequent; concentration is reduced; increased sensitivity to noise; and inability to make decisions. There are also physiological symptoms such as high blood pressure, increased heart rate, sweating, numbness, lack of bladder and bowel control, indigestion and tension headaches.

How the patient describes the specific nature of their voice problem can provide essential diagnostic and therapeutic information.

      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Psychic activity relies on the physiological processes occurring in the brain. When disruptive factors, such as alcohol consumption or hallucinogenic substances intervene, the product of nervous activity, known as the psyche, becomes disturbed, resulting in perception, thought, and behavioral disorders. The psyche can be considered a fascinating mechanism oscillating between extremes: it can be both objective and subjective; both material and ideal. Additionally, the psyche manifests itself both normally and pathologically. Regarding the ways the psyche manifests, distinct categories can be identified. Appropriate behavior exhibited by individuals defines the normal psyche, while the pathological psyche exhibits unusual behavioral disorders often deemed immoral. The term \"normality\" is ambiguous and encompasses several meanings:It can refer to a person's discernment in psychiatric expert evaluations for judicial purposes; It can be associated broadly with individual health; It represents physical, mental, and social well-being; Psychiatrically, it is defined by the absence of mental illness. Medico-legal psychiatric examinations play a crucial role in justice, providing data to assess the responsibility of individuals who have committed criminal acts. To promote ethical principles and lawful conduct, preventive and intervention measures must be devised for cases involving antisocial defiance and social maladaptation. The pathological psyche is characterized by biological and/or psycho-behavioral changes that cause distress, disability, or a high risk of such outcomes (according to the American Psychiatric Association, 1994).",

      "abstract": "Postconcussion syndrome is a poorly defined term that refers to the temporary symptoms that can follow a minor head injury. In the vast majority of cases, symptoms resolve within days or weeks. The most common symptoms include: difficulty with concentration and attention, slowed speed of mental processing, anxiety, emotional lability, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache. The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders.

It influences the prevalence of depression phenotypes: melancholic, anxious, primarily somatic, or highly externalized “masculine depression.” External stigma of depression is universal, but its details are culture-dependent. The acceptability and feasibility of specific treatments vary by culture. Before prescribing against a patient’s culturally based biases, a clinician should consider not only medication and psychotherapy but also lifestyle or environmental changes; complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine; antidepressant smartphone apps; light therapy; and non-invasive brain stimulation. Depression biomarkers soon may have a role in selection of treatments that are both culturally compatible and likely to work.",

Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be measured or “objectively” verified by other individuals. Reactions to pain, however, can be registered by others. Pain in the orofacial area may have several etiological explanations. Since the functional pattern of the area is multi‐faceted, persisting pain in the area most likely has a multi‐factorial background, and also a variety of effects. Treatment should be made considering delicate diagnostical distinctions. A thorough clinical examination contains lots of treatment components.

Evaluation of concussion involves assessments of multiple domains or clinical profiles, including vestibular, ocular, headache, cognitive, mood, fatigue, and other systems. Initial management consists of a short rest period followed by increasing activity that does not exacerbate symptoms. Cognitive modifications for school or work also are initiated early in the management plan. Use of other management modalities is based on findings from the physical examination. Imaging may be needed in cases of worsening or progressive symptoms. When athletes have returned to baseline symptom burden and have returned to school or work, they may transition to a return to play/sport progression. Most sports-related concussions resolve within 2 weeks for adults and 4 weeks for adolescents.

      "abstract": "It is well known that emotional factors and chronic stressors increase the risk for and outcome of cardiovascular disease. Emotional factors refer to affective problems such as depression, anxiety, anger, and hostility. Chronic stressors encompass low social support, low socio-economic status, work-related stress, and marital stress.1 Adverse outcomes may occur through interactions of these factors with physiological factors such as the central nervous system and the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, metabolic abnormalities, inflammation, insulin resistance, or endothelial dysfunction. Another, perhaps equally important pathway may be through the interaction with other behavioural factors such as non-compliance with prescribed medication, physical inactivity, or smoking. The exact role and importance of these mechanisms, however, need further investigation.1\n\nFollowing the increasing understanding of the importance of stressors and emotional factors, and primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, research has begun to examine the impact of psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. It was hoped that successful treatment of these factors may have a spin-off favourable effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Currently, psychosocial interventions are embedded in most guidelines for cardiovascular rehabilitation, but are usually based on consensus.2–4 A strong evidence base, coming from solid meta-analyses, however, was lacking in isolating the benefits on mortality and morbidity in patients with established cardiovascular disease that are solely attributable to psychological interventions. Moreover, gender differences in outcomes were not taken into account and a distinction between short- and long-term benefits has usually not been made. Based on a meta-analysis of available studies, Linden et al. concluded that psychological treatment reduced mortality of cardiac patients by 27% for at least the first 2 years after a cardiovascular event5. Event recurrence was reduced by 43% at follow-up >2 years. Successful reduction of stress was necessary for mortality benefits to occur.

      "abstract": "Each year more than 400 physicians take their lives, likely related to increasing depression and burnout. Burnout-a psychological syndrome featuring emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment-is a disturbingly and increasingly prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, and emergency medicine (EM) in particular. As self-care based solutions have proven unsuccessful, more system-based causes, beyond the control of the individual physicians, have been identified. Such system-based causes include limitations of the electronic health record, long work hours and substantial educational debt, all in a culture of no mistakes allowed. Blame and isolation in the face of medical errors and poor outcomes may lead to physician emotional injury, the so-called second victim syndrome, which is both a contributor to and consequence of burnout. In addition, emergency physicians (EP) are also particularly affected by the intensity of clinical practice, the higher risk of litigation, and the chronic fatigue of circadian rhythm disruption. Burnout has widespread consequences, including poor quality of care, increased medical errors, patient and provider dissatisfaction, and attrition from medical practice, exacerbating the shortage and maldistribution of EPs. Burned-out physicians are unlikely to seek professional treatment and may attempt to deal with substance abuse, depression and suicidal thoughts alone. This paper reviews the scope of burnout, contributors, and consequences both for medicine in general and for EM in particular.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "The circadian rhythm is a periodic and continuous change caused by the light/dark cycle as the Earth rotates around its own axis in a 24- hour cycle. The circadian clock system regulates the 24-hour daily rhythms of human physiology and behavior such as the sleep/wake cycle, body temperature, hormone secretion, and mood. The influence of circadian rhythm on the body and mind is obvious, but considerable research has not dealt with its effects on human disease, especially on mental illnesses. However, several recent studies have shown that circadian misalignment may play an important role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder. Evidence for circadian rhythm misalignment in bipolar disorder suggests that circadian rhythm phase shift is a key pathophysiologic mechanism.

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

The exact cause of depression isn't fully understood, even though biological factors like imbalance in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine play a significant role. Psychological factors, such as trauma, chronic stress, low self-esteem, and negative thinking patterns, can contribute to the development and exacerbation of depression. Diagnosis of depression involves assessing persistent feelings of sadness or loss of interest in daily activities, along with other accompanying symptoms, lasting for at least two weeks. Depression is a treatable condition, which may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy), medication (such as antidepressants), and lifestyle changes.",

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopathological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforces that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, has to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

Medical comorbidity has been associated with more complex illness presentations, greater severity of mood symptoms, and delay to treatment. The pathophysiology underlying bipolar disorder may foster the development of a variety of medical disorders. Several mediators have been postulated as theoretical links between medical comorbidities and illness progression. These include hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disturbances, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. These mediators also provide a link to the theory of allostatic load in bipolar disorder and the resulting ‘wear and tear’ of the body. Taken together, findings to date suggest the importance of approaching bipolar disorder, both scientifically and clinically, as a systemic disorder with both physical and psychiatric manifestations.",

While most peripheral vestibular disorders can be identified by testing and examination, those without inner‐ear causes that have persisting complaints of dizziness and motion sickness are more difficult to understand and to manage. Some of these patients exhibit features compatible with vestibular migraine and may be treated successfully with migraine‐preventative medications.

This is an attitude that they unfortunately share with most nonalcoholics; therefore some tact is required in referring them for treatment. If the alcoholic demonstrates abnormal behavior, appears depressed, or evidences a disturbance in his thinking (most frequently, ill-founded or illogical suspicions or grandiose opinions), he should certainly be examined psychiatrically, since in such cases the drinking may only be symptomatic of a severe underlying mental disturbance.

Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "Data mining algorithms and its application having different and diverse field. One of the challenging and emerging research fields is medical science. Medical field exhibit many type of data and thus it provide large statically and dynamic data, its relevant Meta data which contains a detail information about the observation made in different scenario. Medical data such as EEG, ECG reports, MRI reports, different lab test reports and other observation which are either in text format or graphical image format derived. These are different sample format describe various symptoms and prevention associate with those symptoms. Genetic activity, genes presence and repetition also gives user activity detail and problems in human body. Mental illness is a type of disease which relate with the mental disorder. It deals in human interaction, its behavior, and its regular and irregular activity. In this stage human sudden start misbehave or extra activities during the particular phase and hence an un-predictable incident may occur. Psychometric disease cases are increasing day by day with different symptoms in human being. These are diseases which occur due to over work pressure, mental activity, some past human life incident or may be the victim of some good or bad incident. It leads to several problems in society, as per well issue with the person who is suffering with the particular disorder. An human interaction and understanding capacity is different than a normal person which keep person separate from the normal society and social life. These disorders also occur sometime very violent and make it very tedious to recover. Psychiatric relate to brain disorder, Mental disorder, irregular work performing in public etc. Diagnosis over the disease is complex and not fixed. In the previous research on the same concern shows that the past data can be analyzed properly and it can further be useful for the precautions. Mental disorder records may leads to several Meta data, report activities observed by hospital or supervision person. A classification over the given symptoms, its action and medical treatment help in diagnosis. Past studies always parts in important role using which further decision can be taken. Mental disorder, mental health, further possibilities can be observed and driven remedy can be discussed. Data classification algorithm makes it possible to classify the normal and abnormal data cases. Hospital release dataset give the information which tends to changes, mental health of previous patients and their best precautions taken to cure them. Different algorithm model is used which help in mining the previous algorithm data rule over the past cases. It enable user to understand past cases, their symptoms, disease occurred and its diagnosis steps taken. Various algorithms such as Genetic algorithm, Naïve bayes, Ant colony optimization, Rule based reasoning (RBR), Case based reasoning (CBR) and Artificial neural network (ANN) is used for psychometric disease finding from the large dataset. In this paper survey of past techniques is performed. This paper also illustrates the work finding and limitation of previous research. An analysis using the real time dataset over the proposed algorithm is left for further work..",

      "title": "Somatic delusional disorder in a patient with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus",
      "abstract": "Background: The delusional disorder represents one of the most difficult psychiatric disorders in terms of treatment and management because of the beliefs and convictions presented by the patient, the absence of insight and also the treatment-resistance. Of these, the somatic delusion or the hypochondriac delusion represent that situation in which the patient presents the conviction that certain parts of his body doesn`t work properly and that some parts of its have exaggerated or diminished dimensions or they present various unpleasant olfactory and tasteful features. One of the specificities of this disorder is represented by the non-bizarre character of the delusion in contrast to the others bizarre delusions specific to schizophrenia but which the patient supports without a doubt in contrast to the somatoform disorder. (1) Purpose and methods: The purpose of the presentation is to highlight the evolution of such a somatic delusion disorder and the challenges met throughout the diagnosis and investigation processes corroborating the brain changes we found with the prognosis of the current disorder. Description of the case: D.E. is a 64 years old woman presenting in our clinic having in her psychiatric antecedents only one admission until now and which presents a delusion somatic disorder consisting of T8-T10 located vertebral-thoracic hyperalgesia accompanied by depressive mood with anhedonia, high-intensity anxiety and abulia. The patient argues that she suffered a thoracic-lumbar trauma by falling from the same level 8 years ago and since then the somatic complaints appeared. All this time the patient underwent three surgeries located at the vertebra-thoracic level, without a consistent improvement of the symptoms. At the cerebral computerized tomography performed in our clinic is highlighted a normal pressure hydrocephalus. Following psychotropic treatment and various inter-clinical consultations the patient exits our service with an improved affective status and a still maintained but low-intensity somatic delusion. Conclusions: It is necessary that the somatic delusion disorder be strictly differentiated by the somatoform disorder and the major depressive disorder with somatic complaints. Also, the differential diagnosis of the possible somatic etiologies must be taken into account. In this regard the psychiatric interview and the brain changes highlighted paraclinically may be essential in the diagnosis and the future evolution of the psychiatric disorder.",

Rather than viewing them as something to be overcome, the emotional responses of the physician can be analyzed for information about the patient or about the physician. The emotional states of patients arouse complementary reactions in the clinician that are diagnostic clues to important clinical syndromes such as depression or character disorders. Conversely, the physician can have idiosyncratic responses to patients that can lead to inappropriate diagnostic and therapeutic choices or to avoidance of particular problems or patients. Self-awareness is the key to utilizing these reactions to improve the patient-physician relationship.",

This chapter also discusses how to differentiate BDD from normal appearance concerns and from problematic preoccupation with obvious physical defects. BDD is commonly misdiagnosed as another mental disorder. Sometimes misdiagnosis occurs because patients are too embarrassed and ashamed to reveal their appearance concerns; in such cases, BDD symptoms that are more readily observable (such as social anxiety) may be assigned an incorrect diagnosis while BDD goes undetected. In other cases, BDD symptoms are recognized but are misdiagnosed as another disorder. BDD must be differentiated from other conditions so appropriate treatment can be instituted.",

      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dyspepsia is a remarkably common symptom in the general population. Although multiple definitions have been used to describe the symptom, the most common explanation is that of chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort (a subjective negative feeling that may be associated with early satiety, fullness, bloating, or nausea) centered in the upper abdomen. When a thorough evaluation of a dyspeptic patient fails to identify a cause for her symptoms, the label of nonulcer or functional dyspepsia is applied. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by relapsing and remitting symptoms. Treatment strategies should focus on alleviating the most bothersome symptom and can be based on the proposed underlying pathophysiology. The effect of gender on mechanisms of disease, symptom presentation, and treatment response is an area of increasing interest and study. As with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, there appear to be some gender-specific features of functional dyspepsia. Specifically, gender-related differences have been observed in some studies of both the prevalence of individual dyspepsia symptoms, and in gastric emptying and proximal gastric motor function. There also appear to be gender differences in the psychosocial realm, with dyspeptic women experiencing a lesser sense of well-being than dyspeptic men, as well as an association of an abuse history with functional dyspepsia.

      "abstract": "AbstractChronic idiopathic pain syndrome is a common, disabling and costly condition. It is believed to be of psychological origin but may involve both cerebral and peripheral physiological mechanisms. It is often associated with depression. Its assessment and management need to be multifactorial, i.e., medical, psychosocial and psychiatric.A thorough initial medical assessment is crucially important in order to identify any organic contributory factors and to gain the patient's trust. It is also essential to carry out a psychosocial and psychiatric assessment so as to evaluate the role of psychological and socioeconomic factors and establish whether a diagnosable psychiatric disorder is present. The latter is most likely to be a depressive, anxiety, or somatoform disorder.If the medical assessment fails to come up with a plausible organic explanation for the patient's pain, he or she should be told so clearly. The patient should be told that the goal of the treatment is not to cure the pain but to help him/her improve his/her functioning and sense of control over pain and life generally. The type of management most likely to succeed in this goal is one that is multifactorial and comprehensive rather than focused on one treatment modality only.Key Words: painsomatizationhysteria",

Somatically, the illness and treatment threaten physical integrity.\nCancer is an insidious disease, in which the patient is severely ill before he\nnotices any symptoms. The (mostly) invasive treatment often results in the patient\nfeeling worse after treatment than before. This means that the confidence the\npatient has in his own body is diminished.\nSocially, the illness, treatment and its consequences (tiredness, lack of energy,\nfeeling ill) may result in social isolation. This can be increased by the fear and\nuncertainty of by-standers how to approach the patient, what to say to him, and\nwhat to expect from him.\nPsychologically, the patient has to cope with the emotional consequences of the\nillness, such as changes in life perspective, mourning his lost health, and anxiety\nand uncertainty about the future.\nThe literature on the prevalence of psychological distress in cancer patients is\nequivocal. The percentages of depressed and/or anxious patients reported in the\nliterature vary widely from 0% to 49% (cf. Bulman, 1992; Omne-Ponten,\nHolmberg, Burns, Adami & Bergstrom, 1992; Devlen, Maguire, Phillips, Crowther\n& Chambers, 1987). It is worthwhile to solve the lack of clarity on this point.

The physical symptoms of psoriasis, namely pruritus, can contribute to disease-related psychosocial stress, although its role may be less prominent than other features. Psoriasis-induced stress can lead to a self-perpetuating problem as stress has been suggested to precipitate psoriasis flares. Small studies have shown improved response to phototherapy and increased remission duration when phototherapy is combined with a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), respectively.

Pain becomes chronic only when this unpleasant sensory and emotional experience persists for much longer than expected relative to the severity or duration of the initial noxious stimulus. The regions of symptom onset, patterns of radiation or referral to other body sites, and any association with loss or excess of somatic sensation within the symptomatic regions have major relevance in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In patients who suffer from multiple pain types or regions, or in whom there coexists abnormal perception of different modes of sensory stimulation, documenting clinical data using only verbal descriptors can be overwhelming. Historically, large portions of the autonomic nervous system have been thought of as only being responsible for the creation of involuntary physiological responses to acute, stressful or noxious stimuli.",

Such withdrawal arises either by reduction or cessation of alcohol ingesta that may be due to voluntary or involuntary motivations but inevitably will lead him to such state which does not always let up of its own accord later but, on the contrary, if not terated properly may end up in alcoholic psychosis, and if that is not the case, the distress it causes, which we are going to see in the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, makes the patient immediately resort to alcohol to avoid its unpleasant consequences, particularly sleep disturbances, tremor or anxiety. These symptoms are easily recognized by the patient and that is why he knows that alcohol soothes them fast and then in order to avoid them he falls on drinking, thus the disease cycle continues, impairing his health.",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

In the context of long-term medical conditions, depression is associated with reduced quality of life, greater disability, higher healthcare costs, poorer concordance with treatment and poorer health outcomes. Pain is a universal experience but is usually an acute problem, which resolves over time or with treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy is more widely researched in relation to chronic pain than to any other chronic medical problem. Psychological factors are known to affect the pain system and play an important role in acute and chronic pain. Diabetes is a chronic, progressive condition in which blood sugar levels rise because the body cannot process glucose properly.

However, the authors' review of recent long-term follow-up studies and of the clinical experiences of early researchers strongly challenges this pervasive expectation. This report suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the long-term outcome of schizophrenia, with marginal or deteriorated states more the exception than the rule.

      "abstract": "Sexuality is considered as a great human value related to happiness and satisfaction, but unfortunately, when affecting mental disorders, they tend to be associated with second level human functions. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction often accompanies psychiatric disorder, intensely influencing compliance, quality of life and human relationships. Sexuality could be influenced either by a mental disorder itself, difficulties to get and maintain couple relationships or by the use of psychotropic treatments. Treatment-related adverse events are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians, scarcely spontaneously communicated by patients, and rarely investigated in clinical trials. The most frequent psychotropic compounds that could deteriorate sexuality and quality of life include antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood regulators. There are important differences between them related to some variations in mechanisms of action including serotonin, dopamine and prolactin levels. Little is known about the relevance of sexuality and its dysfunctions in chronic and frequent mental and neurological disorders, such as psychosis, mood disorders, anxiety, phobias, eating disorders, alcohol or drug dependencies, epilepsy and childhood pathology. Poor sexual life, low satisfaction and more frequent risky sex behavior than in the general population are associated with severe mental diseases. There is a need for increasing research in this field, including epidemiological, psychological, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic variables related to sexual life to get a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. To increase the sensibility of clinicians, the identification and management of sexual disturbances after the onset of any mental disorder should be highlighted. This would avoid unnecessary suffering and deterioration of quality of life.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

      "abstract": "Major depression, as well as other depressive disorders, is commonly comorbid with other medical illnesses, particularly chronic and systemic medical illnesses. The co-occurrence of the disorders is so common that it challenges our notions of the meaning of comorbidity and our desire to neatly separate psychiatric and medical illnesses. The overlap between symptoms of physical illness and the neurovegetative symptoms of major depression and the initial normative emotional response to physical illness add to the challenge of accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of depression in the medically ill. We review the literature on the comorbidity of depression and the various medical illnesses, including diagnostic and treatment approaches. The differential diagnosis for major depression among medically ill patients should include delirium and medication-induced symptoms. We suggest that major depression itself may be best conceptualized as a systemic illness whose pathophysiology overlaps with other systemic medical illnesses. The initial treatment strategies for major depression in medical illness are like those for the general population; however, the comorbid medical illnesses may interfere with remission. To illustrate these points, we describe a patient with clinical characteristics covered in this review who experienced major depression as well as several chronic illnesses, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain due to degenerative joint disease, and diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is the main cause of disability among psychiatric disorders worldwide. This surprisingly high burden is related to its high prevalence and its severity. Indeed, depression is often comorbid with somatic as well as psychiatric disorders (particularly suicide, anxiety, and substances), and response to antidepressants is only seen in a minority of patients. Other issues related to the difficulties of treating these patients are the frequency of residual symptoms (mood, fatigue, sleep or appetite disorders) that have been associated with relapses and recurrences. Furthermore, emotional regulation during euthymic periods may be viewed as predictive of subsequent intensity of depressive symptoms. Treatment of depression is a major challenge in daily practice, and researchers need to propose more effective treatments based on innovative approaches. The cyclic nature of depressive illness, the diurnal variations in its symptomatology, and the existence of disturbed sleep-wake and core body temperature rhythms all suggest that dysfunction of the circadian time-keeping system may underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Circadian misalignment of the phase-delayed type appears to be the common shift in unipolar depression and, interestingly, the misalignment between the timing of sleep and the pacemaker is correlated with depressive symptom severity. So, as circadian rhythm disturbances are at the core of depression, their normalizing may be a fruitful avenue for new therapeutic targets in depression.",

      "title": "Insomnia in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women and in some somatic diseases",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "Studies in Schizophrenia, V.",
      "abstract": "The problems of diagnosis, pathogenesis, aetiology and successful treatment of the idiopathic schizophrenias is one of the most urgent and formidable ones which psychiatry has still to tackle. It is most urgent because of the large number of sufferers struck by the disease, made unfit for a successful life at an early age, and the distress imposed on them and their relatives. It is most formidable because our essential knowledge of the nature of this disease, or possibly group of diseases, is scanty and disorderly and opinions are conflicting and contradictory. This unsatisfactory state is made worse by the fact that there is quite an amount of disagreement on diagnosis, so that often the findings of different workers do not refer to comparable groups of patients (and conditions in which they are examined) which must add to the confusion, particularly when metabolic examinations are carried out. Too often “marginal psychoses“, and also not rarely, paranoid hallucinatory states with and without changes of the personality are called “schizophrenia”. The last-named states are not infrequently schizophrenoid reactions (or reactions of a schizoid person) to psychogenic causes or to potentially diagnosable physical disorders. On close clinical examination one would also find that the symptomatology of such cases is not that of idiopathic schizophrenia. In the “classical” schizophrenias of Kraepelin, Bleuler and Kleist, despite some discrepancies, the typical para-functions of feeling, willing, thinking and activity, usually accompanied by hallucinations, mainly auditory, and paranoid delusions are present and also a disturbance of the albumin/globulin ratio in C.S.F. and serum. In the absence of this mental and physical symptomatology the diagnosis of idiopathic schizophrenia should not be made (Fleischhacker et al. (7, 8)).",

It is important to understand that stress impacts psychological, physiological, immunological, and behavioral functions that not only require individual coping strategies but affect disease onset and/or progression in both humans and animals. Integrative studies have demonstrated significant consequences of stress on metabolic, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health as well as individual fitness and immune modulation. It is apparent that there exist many similarities between humans and animals encountering a stressful stimulus. Individual variation in stress susceptibility is related to genetic predisposition and early experience.

Ascribed and prescribed, mental illness diagnoses and experiences vary based on medicalized norms. Medicalization of mental illness occurs via three main authoritative professions: psychiatry, psychology, and clinical social work. The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common.

      "title": "The confusing tale of depression and distress in patients with diabetes: a call for greater clarity and precision",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies have identified significant linkages between depression and diabetes, with depression associated with poor self‐management behaviour, poor clinical outcomes and high rates of mortality. However, findings are not consistent across studies, yielding confusing and contradictory results about these relationships. We suggest that there has been a failure to define and measure ‘depression’ in a consistent manner. Because the diagnosis of depression is symptom‐based only, without reference to source or content, the context of diabetes is not considered when addressing the emotional distress experienced by individuals struggling with diabetes. To reduce this confusion, we suggest that an underlying construct of ‘emotional distress’ be considered as a core construct to link diabetes‐related distress, subclinical depression, elevated depression symptoms and major depressive disorder ( MDD ). We view emotional distress as a single, continuous dimension that has two primary characteristics: content and severity; that the primary content of emotional distress among these individuals include diabetes and its management, other life stresses and other contributors; and that both the content and severity of distress be addressed directly in clinical care. We suggest further that all patients, even those whose emotional distress rises to the level of MDD or anxiety disorders, can benefit from consideration of the content of distress to direct care effectively, and we suggest strategies for integrating the emotional side of diabetes into regular diabetes care. This approach can reduce confusion between depression and distress so that appropriate and targeted patient‐centred interventions can occur.",

Depressive disorders can have severe consequences in terms of suffering, disability, and increased mortality, particularly if left untreated. They are present in all cultural settings and present a major difficulty for the normal functioning of patients' families. A large proportion of people with depressive disorders do not get treatment, and a major reason depressive disorders go unrecognized is that they often present mainly physical symptoms. The fact that depression often co-occurs with physical illness further complicates the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders. Better undergraduate education of medical students and general education for the public in understanding and treating depressive disorders could considerably improve the prognosis of patients suffering from these illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are more prevalent than any other mental health problem in the USA, but afflicted patients are often untreated or treated only by a primary care physician. Anxiety disorders can be understood in the context of the interplay of biological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. Psychiatry has defined effective treatment that integrates education, psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. A combination of treatment approaches may be beneficial. Anxiety related symptoms, other than a true anxiety disorder, may be precipitated by normal stresses of daily life. These patients may also benefit from treatments used in anxiety disorders. Anxiety can also occur secondary to medical disorders and medications, as well as being present as part of other psychiatric syndromes. Diagnosis requires a history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Anxiety disorders, although common, are easily overlooked because patients may present with somatic complaints rather than admit to having emotional problems. Anxiety disorders are divided into seven categories in DSM IV, with each allowing for a differential treatment approach. Non-pharmacological treatments are the first line of treatment, and may include behavior therapy and cognitive therapy. The physician-patient relationship is itself a powerful treatment tool. Key areas in which the psychiatrist can help the patient cope are outlined. Benefits and risks of drug treatment for anxiety disorders are discussed.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

It is thought that, during the conversation, the thought of the negative reactions that the patient might encounter, affects the fluency of the speech. Researches on stuttering in bipolar disorder are limited. In this article, we discussed a case who has stuttering since childhood and whose stuttering got well during bipolar disorder manic episodes. It was observed that the patient's stuttering complaint was resumed when the patient had reached the euthymic state by the treatment.",

      "title": "A transient personality disorder induced by football matches.",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are a class of mental diseases characterized by inflexible and maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, involving several areas of functioning, such as affectivity, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking and reaction to stress factors. In the literature, personality disorders have always been described as stable patterns of long duration, and their onset can be found during adolescence or early adulthood. These patterns are associated with significant distress or impairment in a patient's life in which a main element affects every aspect of living, and in which no biological or other pathologies exist to assist in its identification. Therefore, they often lead to comorbidities such as dysfunctional anxiety, drug abuse, major depression and suicide.We present a case of a 37-year-old man, who came to the outpatient department needing support to quit smoking. During the follow up, he described some transitory changes in his personality while watching football (soccer) games. These episodes were characterized by inappropriate anger crises, rapid and dramatic shifts in emotional tone, dysphoria and superstitious and magical beliefs with paranoid elements; connecting himself, his family and friends to players in the match and to the unfolding of the game. Every manifestation was induced by the football match, and there were no signs of difficulty in handling impulses and in managing relationships, or any superstitious beliefs, outside of it.The combination of all the symptoms led us to think about a diagnosis of the borderline personality disorder. There was a lack of managing impulsivity, intense uncontrollable emotional reactions, and episodes of psychotic decompensation with unreal and paranoid connections made between the patient's entourage and the results of the match.With this case, we propose to consider the personality disorder, not just as a stable and inflexible pattern, but also as a transitory dysfunction induced by stress factors, as in this case, a football match, introducing therefore a new entity: transient personality disorder.",

Measures of health-related QOL assess health perception as well as physical, emotional and social function, and this is referred to as functional status. Such measurement is now considered to be a key factor in the assessment of patients with conditions such as functional dyspepsia, where there is chronic or recurrent unexplained pain or discomfort centred in the upper abdomen. QOL measures may be used to try and discriminate among a number of disease groups or to assess change in disease status over time; different approaches are usually necessary to meet these goals.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria. Se recomienda una combinacion de 5 a 10 mgs de haloperidol mas 4 mgs de lorazepam por via intramuscular cada 30 minutos. El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the problem of postcovid depression. The main diagnostic criteria and symptoms of depressive disorder are outlined. It is indicated that the basic symptoms include: depressed mood, loss of curiosity and pleasure from daily activities, increased fatigue, loss of energy and decreased activity. The risk factors that most influence the formation of depressive disorders are analyzed. These factors include: job loss, divorce, loss of relatives, high levels of personal anxiety, and stressful life events. The main goal of therapy in patients with VDR is complete functional recovery and return to the premorbid state. The difficulty of treating depressive disorders lies in the lack of complete recovery in the case of severe or complicated forms of depressive disorders. The author identifies the main emotional and cognitive signs of depressive disorder, namely: low or increased mood, feelings of anxiety and unreasonable anxiety, irritability or manifestations of anger towards yourself or other people, repeated negative thoughts about yourself, about drug addicts and the future, reduced concentration of attention, apathy, inattention. Recovery from depression is not the absence of negative affective symptoms, but the restoration of normal emotional functioning, the ability to be yourself and experience positive emotions. The goal of psychotherapy for depression is to change the patient's negative thoughts, emotional state and mood.",

Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of agitation; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.",

It includes: parts of the body being hurt, not having the usual abilities, medical problems or organ malfunction, microbial infections, health issues, having pain or bad symptoms, unusual body shapes. The study of disease is called pathology. Disease can be described as a medical condition associated with particular symptoms and signs. It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural. Diseases are categorised into four main types: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, genetic diseases and physiological diseases. Diseases can be classified as contagious and non-contagious. The fatal diseases in humans are HIV, Coronary Artery Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and cancer.",

Diagnostic criteria for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2000; the American Psychiatric Association had previously established very specific diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both diagnoses require 2 months of prospective symptom ratings, which can be accomplished using forms designed by individual clinicians or employing 1 of a number of validated instruments. The patient will need to provide a complete family and personal history of mental disorders and medical diseases. A thorough physical examination and certain basic laboratory tests should either identify or rule out many potential causes of the symptoms. The diseases, disorders or situations considered in the differential diagnosis of PMS and PMDD will depend on the woman's presenting symptoms. Many women with a bothersome or debilitating premenstrual disorder go undiagnosed, either because they do not report their symptoms to a clinician or because the clinician has difficulty diagnosing the disorder.",

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\". The symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization frequently co-occur in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, primarily in patients with anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in routine activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure. There are several depression classification systems and diagnostic tools based on clinical symptoms, i.e. the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Scale and Beck's Depression Inventory. Depression frequently occurs in patients with heart failure, as similar pathophysiological mechanisms of neurohormonal activation, arrhythmia, inflammation and hypercoagulation are present in both these diseases. Prognosis in patients with depression is also affected by insufficient cooperation between a patient and his doctor as regards the lifestyle and medication intake of a patient. Depression is usually accompanied by remission and relapse periods which might be related to the current heart failure status of a patient and despite intensive medical treatment they may recur. Depression is often difficult to diagnose or even left undiagnosed and thus untreated, because its symptoms: fatigue, apathy and decreased exercise tolerance, are common in the general population. Furthermore, safety and efficacy of antidepressant therapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases are not well established. Evidence from clinical trials evaluating the influence of depression behavioral and pharmacological treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure is also limited. Taking into account that depression affects prognosis in patients with variety of disorders and common pathological mechanisms present both in depression and heart failure, screening tests for depression should be considered not only in patients with diagnosed heart failure but also those at risk of heart failure development.",

      "title": "How to control stress caused by COVID-19?",
      "abstract": "Stress and anxiety are necessary in life to a small extent and sometimes improve people’s performance, but sometimes and in situations such as today, when the disease is prevalent all over the world, this stress is higher than usual and it causes man problems that must be controlled. When this stress, worry, fear, and anxiety intensifies and persists, it becomes abnormal and morbid and causes a variety of reactions, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions. Physical reactions to stress include increased heart rate, sweating, dry mouth, tremors, dizziness, shortness of breath, headache and muscle aches, irritability, fatigue, upset stomach, frequent urination, decreased energy, tiredness, sleep problems, It is a change in appetite and so on.1,2 The cognitive component includes thoughts and beliefs about the person being injured or losing control of the situation. Thus, stress leads to a decrease in the ability to think, a decrease in the ability to pay attention and focus, problems related to memory and recall, magnification and catastrophizing problems, and so on. Emotional reactions include fear, worry, sadness, loss of interest in normal pleasurable activities, feelings of frustration, irritability, anger, feelings of helplessness, and so on. Behavioral reactions include avoid\u0002ing certain situations, asking frequently asked questions about how things are going, constantly looking for common sense, blaming others, spreading rumors, dependence on alcohol and drugs, and so on.2,3 In the current situation, the corona virus is a concern and needs attention and care, especially when we feel threatened and do not have the necessary ability to deal with it, it is natural to experience anxiety, worry, anxiety and fear. There are several reasons for this stress, including the speed with which the disease spreads from epidemic to pandemic; Unawareness and complete lack of knowledge of this virus in terms of its signs and symptoms; Methods of transmission, methods of prevention and primary care, duration of the disease, methods of treatment and its consequences, the existence of contradictory information, infodemias or statistics and unreliable information and its magnification through social networks, etc. have caused stress, Fear and worry about this disease becomes much more than the disease itself.3-5",

      "abstract": "The following case study illustrates the clinical role of mental health professionals who specialize in the treatment of people with diabetes. This case describes the diagnostic dilemma presented by a patient with diabetes and a history of severe hypoglycemia complicated by other medical, psychiatric, social, and functional problems.\n\nCognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, increased distractibility, and confusion) can present a difficult diagnostic problem for clinicians because it can be symptomatic of many underlying and undetected clinical conditions. Careful diagnosis is crucial because some causes may be progressive and irreversible, whereas other causes may be reversible with medical or psychiatric treatment. Some of the more noteworthy causes are related to medication, alcohol, aging, depression, and, as in this case study, the possible consequences of recurrent severe hypoglycemia related to diabetes.1 Diabetes, of course, may cause an increase in cognitive decline over the course of time because of vascular risk factors.2 Some evidence suggests that acute hyperglycemia may have a negative impact on cognitive performance.3\n\nDepression is the most common of the reversible causes of memory impairment, and people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those without diabetes.4 Recent evidence suggests that diabetes may create alterations in regions of the brain that are associated with affect regulation and increase the risk for developing a depressive disorder.5 Fortunately, problematic medications can be modified, and alcohol misuse or depression can be treated. Unfortunately, despite its relevance to the course of diabetes, depression is recognized and treated in fewer than one-third of people with diabetes.4\n\nThe relationship between recurrent severe hypoglycemia and cognitive impairment remains unclear.

      "title": "Feeling the Blues",
      "abstract": "KUGATHASANDepression is a widespread illness that affects people regardless of age, nationality, race, and gender.Nearly everyone has feelings of blue moods at some point in their lives.It is when these feelings persist, recur, or become severe that one may be experiencing depression and should seek medical help.People with a depressive illness cannot merely \"pull themselves together\" and get better.Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years and it can be debilitating.Fortunately, today, there is a wide range of medications and therapies available to treat depression.A complex interplay of factors involving genetics, stress, and changes in body and brain function are thought to play a role in the development of depression (Kaufman, 2001).One of the reasons that depression is so common is because the illness may develop for a variety of reasons.A recent study suggests that abnormalities of the hippocampus may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression (Posener et al, 2003).The exact causes of depression are still in question, but scientists have identified certain risk factors that could increase the likelihood of one becoming depressed Family history of depression, stressful situations such as a death in the family or relationship troubles, dependence on alcohol or drugs, medical conditions such as diabetes or cancer, and other mental illnesses are all risk factors that could lead to depression.Depression can take many forms.What differentiates these forms are the severity and duration of the symptoms.However, there often is not a clear distinction between these different types of depression, since they frequently share many of the same characteristics.The different types of depression can be classified as minor depression or dysthymia, major depression, and manic depression (bipolar disorder), and within each of these main categories there are several subtypes.Major depression, sometimes called clinical depression, is the most common form of depression.It is characterized by a mood change that lasts more than two weeks and includes one or both primary signs of depression: overwhelming feelings of sadness or grief, and loss of interest or pleasure in usually enjoyable activities (Kaufman, 2001).People with major depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, feelings of worthlessness, impaired thinking or concentration, insomnia, feeling tired all the time, significant weight loss or gain.These symptoms may differ from person to person as well as from one depressive episode to the next.For example, some people may have insomnia and lose weight while depressed, whereas others may oversleep, overeat and gain weight (Madison Institute of Medicine).In addition, major depression can range from mild to severe, with varying intensity of symptoms.In extreme cases, people with severe depression may be unable to work or care for themselves.Although major depression is the most common form of depression, approximately 26 per cent of individuals with major depression also suffer from chronic minor depression or dsythymia (Harkness et al, 2002).Dysthymia is a long-lasting form of mild depression characterized by a persistently gloomy outlook.Dysthymia generally lasts for at least two years and sometimes more than five years (Mayclinic.com).It usually isn't as disabling as major depression and periods of dysthymia may alternate with intervals of feeling normal.Signs and symptoms of dysthymia are like those of major depression but not as intense (Rapaport et al, 2002).",

New imaging techniques now make it possible to examine moment-to-moment variations in emotional state and cardiac function.

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric disorders: post-stroke depression. A review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder after stroke, and also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients, which leaded to poor quality of life. A prevalence of 30% is estimated between 1 to 5 years after stroke. More than half of all cases are neither diagnosed nor treated. Objectives The aim of this paper is to review the latest updates regarding post-stroke depression and progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Methods A systematic review of the scientific and clinical literature on PSD was conducted. The review included databases such as PubMed and Cochrane, covering articles from the past 10 years. The scientific evidence obtained was analyzed and synthesized. Results Currently, the diagnosis of PSD is mainly based on the DSM guidelines and combined with various depression scales. Symptoms usually occur within the first three months after stroke, the patient presents symptoms of a depressive episode such as low mood, anhedonia, loss of appetite, sleep disorders, vegetative symptoms or social withdrawal. Several mechanisms, including biological, behavioural, and social factors, are involved in its pathogenesis. The main predictors are personal history or cognitive impairment, as well as sequelae of the stroke. Left hemispheric strokes are those with the highest risk of early depression, as well as small subcortical vessel pathology. Treatment is mainly pharmacological, with SSRIs. The probability of recovery is between 15 and 57% in the first year, with a recurrence of 38% at two years, up to 100% at 15 years. In addition, there is an increase in mortality, especially in those under 65 years of age. Conclusions There are still many unanswered questions in the treatment of PSD, such as the best time to start treatment or the effects of antidepressants on cognition and motor function, among others. Although great advance has been made by researchers, the mechanism of PSD is not completely clear. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

In these cases, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene, antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.",

Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

      "title": "Bipolar Affective Disorder",
      "abstract": "is defined as a ubiquitous and sustained feeling or emotion that dominates a person’s behavior and affects his perception. Mood disorders also known as affective disorders include unipolar and bipolar disorders. Hippocrates was the first to distinguish between different dispositions or humors--melancholic, choleric, phlegmatic, sanguine--but it was Jules Farley in 1854, who first described folie circulaire or the alternating cycle of euphoria and melancholia. In 1899, Emil Kraepelin then further elaborated upon this burgeoning nosological distinction as he distinguished the psychosis observed in manic-depressive disorders from that of dementia praecox (i.e. schizophrenia). Manic-depressive disorder--more contemporarily identified as bipolar disorder (BD)--is a chronic and complex disorder of mood that is characterized by a combination of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes, with subsyndromal symptoms extant in between the mood episodes. It is one of the leading causes of worldwide disability and morbidity. BD has been frequently associated with serious medical and psychiatric comorbidity, early mortality, high levels of functional disability, and compromised quality of life. BD can be further subdivided into bipolar disorder I (BD I) and bipolar disorder II (BD II). The quintessential feature of BD I is the manifestation of at least one manic episode--although depressive episodes are common, only one manic episode in a lifetime is enough to label one with BD I. To be diagnosed with BD II, one must experience at least one hypomanic episode, without any history of any manic episodes. Both of these aforementioned manifestations must precipitate in the absence of any substance, iatrogenic agent, or organicity as such extant associations would be indicative of the diagnoses of 'substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder' and 'bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition', respectively. Additionally, a less elucidated derivative of the bipolar spectrum is 'cyclothymic disorder' which is more analogous to a personality disorder in its chronicity and pervasiveness.",

      "abstract": "Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a frequent diagnosis for sickness absence. The process of sick-listing is complex, and the doctor must integrate information from several levels in the decision. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the main determinants of sickness absence for LBP. Methods: We conducted a non-systematic search in Medline and personal files to identify determinants of sickness absence, and structured these into four levels of the sick-listing process. These levels are characteristics of 1) the sick-listed worker, 2) the sick-listing doctor, 3) the workplace, and 4) the cultural and economic conditions of the society. Results: Important characteristics of the sick-listed person seem to be poor mental health, including negative beliefs about LBP. Also, comorbidity and lack of coping abilities are found associated to sickness absence. The impact of the doctors' personal beliefs about LBP is not clear. Doctors in general seem to be frustrated by their gatekeeper role and the influence of other healthcare providers on the sick-listing decision. The workplace is an important factor in the sick-listing process, but the impact of physical working conditions is of less importance than social support, job control, and demands. On the society level, the economic awards in sickness absence and the general acceptance of being sick listed seem to be of importance for the individual's decision to claim sick leave. Conclusion: The sick-listing process for LBP is complex, and the determinants are mostly non-medical. It seems important to adopt a broad perspective of how a worker copes with pain and how these coping strategies interact with cultural, economic, and societal determinants of sickness certification.",

      "abstract": "Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) is a chronic, potentially disabling psychotic disorder common in clinical settings. SAD often has been used as a diagnosis for individuals having an admixture of mood and psychotic symptoms whose diagnosis is uncertain. Its hallmark is the presence of symptoms of a major mood episode (either a depressive or manic episode) concurrent with symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech.A literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to identify articles on SAD. We also reviewed major textbooks and DSM-5 to identify pertinent information.This review begins with the history and classification of SAD. Debate continues to swirl around the concept, as some experts view SAD as an independent disorder, while others see SAD as either a form of schizophrenia or a mood disorder. The disorder is more common in women and its course follows the middle ground between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. SAD appears to have high heritability. Most patients appear to benefit from antipsychotics plus antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers, depending on whether the patient has the depressive or bipolar subtype. Electroconvulsive therapy can also be effective.SAD is a chronic psychotic disorder that continues to be controversial. There has been inadequate research regarding its epidemiology, course, etiologic factors, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization. Motor and phonic tics in a course of over 1 year that first occured before 18 years are the main features of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). Psychogenic/functional (P/F) tics were considered as a diagnosis made per exlusionem in lack of agreement of diagnostic criteria. Recently, emphasis is in rather highlighting positive signs when making diagnosis of P/F tics. Several features in clinical course are important to differentiate GTS from P/F tics. Some of them are acute onset in adulthood, precipitation by physical event, absent family history of tics, variable, complex and inconsistent phenomenology, suggestibiity, distractibility. Premonitory urge, feeling of excessive energy and being 'wound up' prior tic, is a usual feature of GTS unlike in P/F tics. If present, such premonitory urge have different qualitative and quantitative marks. Another possible diagnostics tool could be the beireitshaftspotential, an event-related electrical potential associated to initiation of movement which is divided in two phases, early (B1) and late (B2) phase. Early phase, whose occurence in some papers has been reported prior P/F tics, is absent prior performed tic in GTS. In everyday clinical practice differentiating GTS from P/F tics is often very challenging but taking proper medical history, paying more attention to positive signs and possibly using electroneurophysiology tests could contribute in making the right diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "abstract": "Errors in clinical reasoning are a major factor for delayed or flawed diagnoses and put patient safety at risk. The diagnostic process is highly dependent on dynamic team factors, local hospital organization structure and culture, and cognitive factors. In everyday decision-making, physicians engage that challenge partly by relying on heuristics - subconscious mental short-cuts that are based on intuition and experience. Without structural corrective mechanisms, clinical judgement under time pressure creates space for harms resulting from systems and cognitive errors. Based on a case-example, we outline different pitfalls and provide strategies aimed at reducing diagnostic errors in health care.A 67-year-old male patient was referred to the neurology department by his primary-care physician with the diagnosis of exacerbation of known myasthenia gravis. He reported shortness of breath and generalized weakness, but no other symptoms. Diagnosis of respiratory distress due to a myasthenic crisis was made and immunosuppressive therapy and pyridostigmine were given and plasmapheresis was performed without clinical improvement. Two weeks into the hospital stay, the patient's dyspnea worsened. A CT scan revealed extensive segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.Faulty data gathering and flawed data synthesis are major drivers of diagnostic errors. While there is limited evidence for individual debiasing strategies, improving team factors and structural conditions can have substantial impact on the extent of diagnostic errors. Healthcare organizations should provide the structural supports to address errors and promote a constructive culture of patient safety.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

The measurement of these symptoms is essential for understanding the individual and planning treatment. There are various instruments that have somatic symptoms measurement in their items. The tools have included somatic symptoms measurement in measuring general psychopathology, somatic symptoms as part of anxiety and depression, somatic symptoms specifically, and as a screening instrument for somatoform disorders. The advantages and disadvantages of common measures have been discussed. It appears that no one measure fulfils the essential criteria of an ideal measure for somatic symptoms. The measures of somatic symptoms should also be culturally sensitive and serve diagnostic, prognostic and heuristic purposes. These aspects are highlighted in the review.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is very common in the elderly. It complicates both psychiatric and somatic disorders and is associated with reduced survival, poor functional results, increased duration of hospital stay, and institutionalization. Diagnosis remains difficult in spite of the improvement of the diagnostic criteria, due to the polymorphism of the clinical signs and fluctuation of vigilance and cognition. Age over 70 and previous cognitive impairment are the main risk factors. Precipitating factors are medical and surgical pathologies, intoxications, especially by therapeutic drugs. Delirium can reveal or complicate a previous dementia. Prevention of delirium and care of the delirious patient require the participation of both the medical and nursing staff.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a broad term, usually referring to any psychiatric disorder in which there is a loss of reality testing, which is generally reflected by the presence of delusions, hallucinations, and/or severe thought disorder and may entail serious behavioral disturbances. In individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), reports of psychosis have included cases that would meet criteria for delirium, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression. The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

Having a relatively early postpartum onset within 4-12 weeks, this pathology may have psychological, social and family repercussions in the long term, both on mother and father, but especially on the child. Postpartum depression is a relatively frequent psychiatric pathology involving some challenges in managing and treating the case due to the increased risk of suicide and infanticide. Having a relatively early postpartum onset within 4-12 weeks, this pathology may have psychological, social and family repercussions in the long term, both on the mother and father, but especially on the child. Postpartum depression manifests with symptoms typical of all depressive episodes, such as depressed mood, irritability, low tolerance to frustration, anxiety, hypersomnia, but also more specific symptoms such as feelings and guilty thoughts about correct child development, lack of empathy, lack of maternal behavior. Emotional, socio-cultural and physiological factors play an important role in the onset of this symptomatology. Postpartum depression raises ethical concerns about the proper conduct of the doctor. In this article we will address both deontological aspects such as doctor-patient confidentiality, suicide and infanticide, as well as the legal aspects that may occur in such situations. Thus, postpartum depression is a therapeutic challenge because of the multiple social, family and legal interferences it presents.",

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

Although classified as a somatic delusional disorder, DI requires special consideration due to its complicated clinical presentation, requiring attention to several possible explanations for the symptoms the patients describe. The purpose of the current review is to first summarize the clinical background and features of the diagnosis then explore treatment options. DI is a rare disorder though has reported cases dating back to the 19th century and spanning across the globe. Patients often experience the disorder as secondary to a medical condition, including substance use/withdrawal. However, there have also been many reported cases of primary DI, occurring in the absence of any other psychiatric or medical disorder. Clinically, DI is a diagnosis of exclusion, where the physician must rule out other medical conditions, including genuine dermatological disorders or infestations, or contributions from medications or substances. Patients with the disorder more commonly present to nonpsychiatric healthcare providers, making it essential for all clinicians to be able to identify the disease. Treatment can include either first or second generation antipsychotics, but it is important to proceed tactfully in discourse with the patient, being careful to address patients in a straightforward manner without reinforcing or questioning the delusion and focusing conversation on what can be done for the symptoms. Future research can continue to evaluate pathophysiology underlying primary DI, which historically has been an under-studied topic.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli.

      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

A unilateral lesion of a cerebral hemisphere (e.g. haemorrhagic stroke) will not cause coma unless there is secondary compression of the contralateral hemisphere or brainstem. Coma is a medical emergency, because a comatose patient is at high risk of permanent brain injury or death, caused either by the underlying disorder or the secondary effects of coma. Stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, and exclusion of hypoglycaemia are the first priorities, before diagnosis is explored further.

      "title": "The Interplay between Pain, Anxiety and Depression",
      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience with two inseparable components: sensory and emotional. The personal property of pain experience makes it difficult to manage and treat due to the influence of genetics, age, gender, spiritual beliefs, social-economic status, and cultural factors. Similarly, medical care methods partly control pain experience and regulate pain progression. Contrary to chronic pain, which is continuous and recurrent, acute pain is primarily due to trauma, acute medical conditions, or treatment. Whatever the case, both can cause mood disorders. The interplay between mood disorders and pain upholds a progressively significant bidirectional link, as mood disorders and pain are risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety heighten pain perception or decrease pain tolerance. Acute or chronic pain can also increase the chances of mood dysregulation. Although depression and anxiety have a close relationship with acute pain, the interplay between depression and acute pain is more comprehensively studied. Most depressed patients present pain as their sole complaint in primary care practices, which unfortunately is overlooked by physicians. Howbeit, reports on experimentally induced pain perception in depressed patients are mixed, presenting both an amplified and reduced pain threshold and tolerance. Although there are less published data about pain and anxiety, the association is regular because increased anxiety equally increases pain perception while decreasing tolerance. The aim of this review was to elucidate more on the mechanisms delineating the interconnectivity of pain and mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "The influence of anxiety and depression on cardiovascular disease is well-known in terms of chronic cardiovascular and ischemic states. It happens mostly through diminished cardiac vagal modulation and greater procoagulant activity in depressed patients. But the impact of emotional factors in acute cardiac events is not estimated enough. From the clinician's point of view, there are an increasing awareness concerning external circumstances and external triggering in sudden cardiac death, that is caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. A number of external, i.e. exogenous factors in everyday life can be implicated in triggering such events. Including heavy physical activity, emotional stressors, meteorologic variables, air pollutants, chronobiologic phenomena, food ingestions, coffee, alcohol etc., emotional stress seems to be among the most often triggers of sudden event. There is a wide range of everyday situations and activities that involves activation of sympathetic nervous system, and emotional stressors are described as trigger caused by sympathetic arousal. Acute emotional arousal can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias and the mechanisms of that risk have been recognized. Acute episode of emotional distress (and notably anger-like stress) may trigger ventricular ectopic beats and tachycardia, as well as acute myocardial infarction. These sudden phenomena can be the result of the endogenous response to external risk of acute emotional stress. Sudden death without antecedent angina, suggesting cardiac arrhythmia, as well as deaths preceded by chest pain, suggesting coronary occlusion were observed in many studies that have led to estimates that between 20 and 40 percent of sudden cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors.",

Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen.

The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly.

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data.

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

      "title": "Borderline, Bipolar, or Both? Frame Your Diagnosis on the Patient History",
      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder are frequently confused with each other, in part because of their considerable symptomatic overlap. This redundancy occurs despite the different ways these disorders are conceptualized: BPD as a personality disorder and bipolar disorder as a brain disease among Axis I clinical disorders. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] BPD and bipolar disorder--especially bipolar II--often co-occur (Box, page 22) and are frequently misidentified, as shown by clinical and epidemiologic studies. Misdiagnosis creates problems for clinicians and patients. When diagnosed with BPD, patients with bipolar disorder may be deprived of potentially effective pharmacologic treatments. (1) Conversely, the stigma that BPD carries--particularly in the mental health community--may lead clinicians to: Nonchance explanations for the diagnostic overlap between BPD and bipolar disorder * [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] 1. Inability of current nosology to separate 2 distinct conditions [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Relatively indistinct diagnostic boundaries confuse the differentiation of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (5 of 9 BPD criteria may occur with mania or hypomania). In this model, the person has 1 disorder but because of symptom overlap receives a diagnosis of both. Because structured interviews do not allow for subjective judgment or expert opinion, the result is the generation of 2 diagnoses when 1 may provide a more parsimonious and valid explanation. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] 2. BPD exists on a spectrum with bipolar disorder The mood lability of BPD may be viewed as not unlike that seen with bipolar disorder. (a) Behaviors displayed by patients with BPD are subsequently conceptualized as arising from their unstable mood. Supporting arguments cite family study data and evidence from pharmacotherapy trials of anticonvulsants, including divalproex, for rapid cycling bipolar disorder and BPD. (b) Family studies have been notable for their failure to directly characterize family members, however, and clinical trials have been quite small. Further, treatment response may have very limited nosologic implications. 3. Bipolar disorder is a risk factor for BPD [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] 4. BPD is a risk factor for bipolar disorder [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Early emergence of a bipolar disorder (in preadolescent or adolescent patients) has been proposed to disrupt psychological development, leading to BPD. This adverse impact on personality development--the scar hypothesis (c)--is supported by data showing greater risk of co-occurring BPD with earlier onset bipolar disorder. (d) More important, prospective studies of patients with bipolar disorder show a greater risk for developing BPD. (e) BPD also may be a risk factor for the development of bipolar disorder--the vulnerability hypothesis. (c) Patients with BPD are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, even compared to patients with other personality disorders. (e) 5. Shared risk factors [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] BPD and bipolar disorder may be linked by shared risk factors, such as shared genes or trait neuroticism. (c) * Some evidence supports each potential explanation, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive * not even disclose the BPD diagnosis to patients (2) * lean in the direction of diagnosing BPD as bipolar disorder, potentially resulting in treatments that have little relevance or failure to refer for more appropriate psychosocial treatments. To help you avoid confusion and the pitfalls of misdiagnosis, this article clarifies the distinctions between bipolar disorder and BPD. We discuss symptom overlap, highlight key differences between the constructs, outline diagnostic differences, and provide useful suggestions to discern the differential diagnosis. …",

      "abstract": "Background: In some medical cases, psychotic symptoms can be part of the clinical picture, and sometimes it can even be the only clinical appearance of the medical condition. Psychotic disorders secondary to organic pathologies affecting the central nervous system are called psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. While some of these secondary causes can easily be detected by laboratory and imaging methods, anamnesis or neurological examination (substance use, trauma, and tumors), others are often overlooked in the presence of rare medical conditions (autoimmune disease and viral encephalitis), when laboratory and examination findings are not clear and psychiatric symptoms are in the foreground. Case Presentation: In this case, we tried to reveal the differential diagnosis and treatment processes of a patient who was admitted to the emergency department with psychotic symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and paranoid delusions, and was admitted to the psychiatry clinic after an urgent medical evaluation. After his admission to the psychiatry clinic, the medical evaluation of the patient was re-evaluated in detail due to memory and orientation deterioration, and as a result, clinical pictures such as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, and epileptic seizures were found to be together in the patient. As a matter of fact, both general medical and psychiatric statuses of the patient improved with the application of low doses and short-term antipsychotic treatment for psychiatric symptoms together with the treatment for this underlying general medical condition. Conclusion: Since the treatment of psychiatric symptoms caused by secondary medical factors is quite different from the treatment of primary psychiatric disorders, it is important to make full medical evaluations, especially in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time or presenting with emergency psychiatric symptoms.",

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

This chapter examines the interrelationship between medical illness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a unique disorder with features of depression and anxiety, from multiple perspectives. Medical illness, especially acute, unexpected illness and injury, can serve as a life-threatening traumatic stressor that precipitates PTSD through multiple mechanisms. PTSD, and even traumatic exposure without subsequent PTSD, may increase the risk of a variety of medical illnesses, with the most-studied illness being cardiovascular disease. PTSD may also worsen the course and outcome of already existing medical illness. Extant research has not addressed the possibility that medical Illness may worsen the course or outcome of PTSD, but similar research has shown only limited effects of medical illness on depression and anxiety outcomes. These reciprocal relationships are thought to exert their effects through mutually reinforcing neurobiological mechanisms as well as through effects on health behaviors.",

      "title": "Familial Paroxysmal Nonkinesigenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "abstract": "Even though most cancer patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for any specific mental disorder [1], many experience symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbances that may interfere with their overall adjustment to their disease. Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease.

      "title": "Using ’White Flags’ to categorize socio-cultural aspects in chronic pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Issue Persistent chronic pain is a major medical and health economic problem. To assess the individual pain situation, the classification of various factors (flags) has been established. Description of the problem Structural biomechanical factors are classified as “red flags”. Psychological or behavioral factors are summarized as “yellow flags”, psychiatric and mental illness as “orange flags”. Both last flags are important for planning adequate therapies or rehabilitation, as well as for decisions to prognoses and tailored reintegration programs. An extension of the flag model was achieved by naming personal factors at workplace as “blue flags”, and “black flags”, if there is a restriction for returning to work. All these groups do not consider other important reasons for unsuccessful rehabilitation or failed reintegration. Results In these cases, often described as ’therapy-refractory’, clients often exhibit a special subjective understanding of illness that reacts neither to psychological interventions nor to behavioral therapies. These include individual beliefs based, for example, on cultural socialization, religious education, or spiritual experiences. Since such individual mental illnesses are culturally ideologically or religiously justified, they should be classified in a separate group called ’white flags’. Lessons The advantages of categorizing sociocultural aspects separately from other flag classifications are avoidance of unnecessary therapies, including surgery,prevention of iatrogenisation,prevention of legal disputes. It is important to realize that only health restrictions for insurance benefits can be taken into account and that individual socio-cultural circumstances or health convictions are not evaluated. Main messages: A classification of ’white flags’ could contribute to a better classification of pain which are not accessible to various therapies and reduce reservations and misunderstandings by intercultural communication approaches. Key messages For medical professions it is important to recognize, that only health inabilities are taken into account for insurance compensation and not individual socio-cultural circumstances or health beliefs. In Future classifying ’white flags’ could help to properly assess persistent pain conditions.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Medical Illnesses in Psychiatric Patients — a Review",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is a high prevalence of physical disorders in psychiatric patients. However, physical disorders often go unrecognised and untreated in routine psychiatric clinical practice. This paper reviews the available literature on the association between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. There is a well-established relationship between major medical disorders and most psychiatric disorders. Early medical diagnosis in psychiatric patients has important clinical significance. Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or occur as side effects of psychotropic medications. It is important that psychiatrists perform adequate clinical examination of their patients in order to recognise and treat the medical disorders. Remedies suggested are adequate training and research, interdepartmental teaching programmes, refresher courses, and active consultation-liaison services in clinical practice. Key words: Anxiety disorders, Comorbidity, Depressive disorder, Schizophrenia Introduction Medical illnesses are more prevalent in psychiatric patients than in the general population. However, these often go unrecognised and untreated in routine clinical psychiatric practice. (1) Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or may occur as side effects of psychotropic medication. Patients suffering from schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders have a higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of exercise. (2) On the other hand, patients with physical disorders are likely to be non-compliant and have higher dropout, morbidity, and mortality rates. Despite the evidence, psychiatrists consider the medical care of their patients to be beyond the scope of their care. They are also reluctant to perform general physical examination of their patients, fearing that this would disrupt the therapeutic relationship. Two-thirds of psychiatrists have never performed physical examination of their patients. According to the available data, a physical examination is performed on only 13% of inpatients and 8% of psychiatric outpatients. (3) This is of increasing concern for mental health professionals in clinical practice. (4) All major psychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are closely associated with physical disorders. By understanding the medical problems of psychiatric patients, psychiatrists can explain to their colleagues in other specialties some significant medical findings that may require immediate attention. Since physical and psychiatric comorbidity is relatively common in general practice, these aspects should be given equal importance. (5) Prevalence of Medical Illnesses among Psychiatric Patients Comorbidities between physical and psychiatric disorders are not uncommon. Over the last 30 years, several studies conducted to determine the prevalence of medical illnesses among psychiatric patients reported prevalence rates of 28% to 92% (Table 1). (6-14) In one study, physical illness was underdiagnosed and not diagnosed in 67% and 50% of the patients, respectively. (6) An unusually high prevalence rate of 90% was reported by a study that included 100 state hospital psychiatric patients who were consecutively admitted to a research ward. In this study, 46% of the patients had an unrecognised medical illness that either caused or exacerbated their psychiatric illness, 80% had physical illnesses that required treatment, and 4% exhibited precancerous conditions. (8) In a study by Bunce et al, 50% of 2395 psychiatric outpatients and 52% of 1448 psychiatric inpatients were found to have a major medical disorder. (10) In a study conducted in a public mental health system, 529 psychiatric patients were medically evaluated. The results revealed important physical diseases in 200 patients; 12% of the patients were found to have physical diseases. …",

      "title": "‘Depression by any other name...’",
      "abstract": "Summary There is a popular conviction that psychological disturbance is invariably a reaction to environmental events. This approach is associated with total rejection of the so-called ‘medical model’. However, allowance must be made for the fact that contemporary knowledge of psychiatric illness is well behind what is now known about general medicine, and current ideas about psychiatric aetiology may be emotionally determined to give satisfying concepts which are often almost impossible to refute. By tracing the progress of some hypotheses in general medicine, as they developed in the past, there are similarities with some current observations about the methods of action of physical treatments in psychiatry, treatments which have been discovered empirically. There is a widespread assumption that psychological responses relate precisely to the degree of evoking stress or the patient's personal attitudes to the stress. However, emotional responsiveness may show an intrinsic individual variation so that many patients who over-respond to stress may do so because of enhanced responsiveness rather than necessarily because psychological events have brought about a state of vulnerability. The exclusively dynamic approach to psychiatry has been perhaps unnecessarily encouraged by naming an illness ‘endogenous depression’ which could well be a primarily physical metabolic disturbance in the central nervous system but which happens to present with prominent depression, as well as other abnormalities. The emphasis on the component of depressed mood artificially delineates the illness and tends to impede consideration of its wider implications.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

      "title": "Is Lack of Control Over Emotions, or Over Stressful Life Events, More Important in Disorders of Emotion?",
      "abstract": "One central thesis of Barlow's review is that there exist at least four disorders of emotion. In each case, a fundamental discrete (fear/panic, sadness/depression, or anger) is thought to occur periodically in vulnerable individuals in what often seems to be a highly unpredictable and/or uncontrollable fashion. The process of what ensues in some individuals who have unpredictable panic attacks is well known: If a cycle of anxious apprehension about the next possible panic attack begins, vulnerable individuals may go on from having occasional infrequent panic attacks to having full-blown panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. What is novel about Barlow's theory is his proposal that parallel processes may occur with the other three fundamental emotions as well: Individuals with uncontrollable bouts of sadness/depression may develop double depression, individuals with uncontrollable manic episodes may become depressed about their perceived inability to control their mania and develop dysphoric mania, and individuals with uncontrollable bouts of anger may maintain an illusion of control over their emotions and experience the stress manifested as physiological disease states such as hypertension or cardiovascular disease. We find this proposal to be highly provocative. However, we also find several of the proposed parallels between the four disorders of emotion not entirely clear for reasons that we try to illustrate. In addition, we conclude with comments that expand on two other issues raised by Barlow's review.",

The group of cases here presented have a physiology or, at any rate, a physiologic psychology which, once understood, opens the doors to a rapid cure. But unless their mechanism of disability is understood the patients may be markedly incapacitated and wander from physician to physician vainly seeking help. In other words, a superficial pathologic condition blocks the normal conduct reactions of the individual as thoroughly as the deeper lying disorder in those cases in which hysteria is really a psychosis demoralizes the individual.",

He showed no response to outpatient treatment and had no history of psychiatric disorders. The onset of symptoms was 2 months before his visit. On neuroimaging, a brain tumor was observed in the right temporal and occipital lobes. Accordingly, the patient was transferred to the neurosurgery ward. Conclusion Factors, such as increased internal pressure on the brain due to a brain tumor or the effect of tumor area, contribute to the occurrence of symptoms, such as restlessness and talkativeness.

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most widespread and common disorders of today. It belongs to internalized disorders or disorders of over-controlled behavior. This emotional state is characterized by feelings of sadness, sorrow, inactivity, and represents the universal and increasingly frequent life experience of modern man. Life events (changes) and influential social factors can be a trigger for depression. Causes can also be biological or genetic. Depression affects all age groups, but not everyone in the same way, with the same intensity or persistence. Also, each group has different causes with regard to age and life experience. It was generally thought that depression was a disease that affected only adults, but it turned out that it was not. It is more difficult to diagnose it at preschool and school age, but in adolescence it is easier because it is a period of the most turbulent change and the symptoms are more visible. One of the dangers of this disorder is that it can lead to suicide. Suicide is not a disorder in itself, but one of the possible outcomes of severe depression.Young people should be taught first and foremost for self-help and self-protection, as well as helped to preserve and promote mental and physical health. They should be objectively informed of all the harmful consequences that may arise as a product of reckless thinking, ideas and behavior. Depression affects the life of an individual by disturbing relationships with close people and can lead to the use of addictive agents. It is treated with different types of psychotherapy and / or pharmacological agents. The combination of all treatments has proven to be the most effective. Psychological educational work with teachers on this disorder has also shown to be effective. It is certainly needed in order for the teacher to recognize the symptoms and to support the child in crisis situations.",

Opinion exists, indeed, that a great many diseases result from, or are strongly influenced by, psychological reactions unsuitable to normal existence. Even expressions of a more conservative attitude concede, with some consistency, a connection between cerebral function and certain visceral ailments, prominent among which are peptic ulcer, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Speculation concerning possible relationship between cause and effect in such instances has resulted principally from clinical analysis of these disorders, particularly from the results of therapeutic attack on the autonomic nervous system in patients suffering from them. For obvious reasons, examination of psychosomatic disorders in experimental animals is extremely difficult. Intercommunication between examiner and subject is impossible and extrapolation of observation to man hazardous. Moreover, disorders of the nature of those used as",

      "abstract": "Among older persons, the prevalence of a depressive disorder is high. Almost half of the depressed patients suffer from significant anxiety symptoms. In clinical practice this combination of depression and anxiety is challenging as high levels of anxiety in depression are associated with more impairment and a worse prognosis. Anxiety in late-life depression has many faces. It can represent itself in a physical or mental form, like tension or worry. With all its complications it can also be categorized as a separate anxiety disorder, like a panic disorder or a generalized anxiety disorder. Many former studies that examined this so-called ‘anxious depression’ did not differentiate between depression with high levels of anxiety and a depression with a concurrent anxiety disorder.Our general message stresses the importance to differentiate between these depressive states. Different characteristics are found, like certain personality traits or the impact of life-events. These characteristics differentiate even further when we look at separate concurrent anxiety disorders. The combination of anxiety and depression shows a less favorable course and has a negative impact on complete remission over a period of two years. In one of the studies, we investigated the feasibility of a method of intensive repeated measurements. The patient reported about her depressive and anxiety symptoms five times a day during her daily activities. This provided a detailed insight in her symptom dynamics and stimulated a dialogue on possible treatment targets and interventions.",

      "abstract": "Functional disorders are clinical entities corresponding to complaints mimicking diseases without a clearly identified organic substrate despite a rigorous history and clinical examination. Sometimes, complementary examinations are necessary to rule out an organic lesion that could explain the symptomatology. The notion of a diagnosis of exclusion is therefore very present. The physician must constantly re-evaluate the diagnosis of functional disorder in order not to «miss» a diagnosis with an organic cause.The treatment of these functional disorders is sometimes based on psychological treatment when a psychogenic dimension seems to be involved. This is not always the case. In such cases it is necessary to be able to consider a placebo approach with the hope that the placebo effect may improve the patient's condition. This article discusses the placebo effect in functional disorders without omitting to address ethical and philosophical considerations.Les troubles fonctionnels sont des entités cliniques correspondant à des plaintes mimant des maladies sans substrat organique clairement identifié, malgré une anamnèse et un examen clinique rigoureux. Parfois, certains examens complémentaires sont nécessaires pour infirmer une lésion organique pouvant expliquer la symptomatologie. La notion de diagnostic d’exclusion est donc bien présente. Le praticien se doit de réévaluer sans cesse le diagnostic de trouble fonctionnel afin de ne pas «passer à côté» d’un diagnostic avec une cause organique. Le traitement de ces troubles fonctionnels repose parfois sur une prise en charge psychologique lorsqu’une dimension psychogène semble incriminée. Ce n’est pas toujours le cas. Il faut alors pouvoir être capable d’envisager une approche via des placebo en espérant que l’effet placebo puisse améliorer la condition du (de la) patient(e).

For patients suffering with bipolar it usually implies a lifelong struggle and challenge. For this reason it is essential to make the correct diagnosis of the disorder as this leads to proper and effective treatment. Bipolar disorder used to be called 'manic-depressive illness' in old terms, but with the evolution and gaining new insight into the illness the disease was changed to 'Bipolar Disorder'. Essentially the term describes extreme mood swings which can range from severe, prolonged depression on the one pole to an excessively elevated or irritable mood (mania) on the other. Most people experience both highs and lows to various degrees and various patterns over time with usually normal periods of mood in between. Other variations include a 'mixed' picture where both highs and lows are experienced at the same time.",

A correlation has also been established between the degree of social stress and an individual's use of medical services. However, the majority of people do not respond to stress in these ways. Social supports (e.g. a caring family) seem to be an important protective factor against the effects of stress. Other mtethods of protection (meditation, relaxation response or learning specific coping skills) are also important, but have been little studied.

Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

Psychological consequencesThough often dismissed as \"understandable,\" distress is a treatable cause of reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcome.Some patients delay seeking help because they fear or deny their symptoms of distress.Presentation can be obvious, as depressed or anxious mood can manifest as increased severity of somatic complaints such as breathlessness, pain, or fatigue.Adjustment disorder is the commonest psychiatric diagnosis, and neuropsychiatric complications may occur.The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of coping with cancer. DepressionDepression is a response to perceived loss.A diagnosis of cancer and awareness of associated losses may precipitate feelings similar to bereavement.The loss may be of parts of the body (such as a breast or hair), the role in family or society, or impending loss of life.Severe and persistent depressive disorder is up to four times more common in cancer patients than in the general population, occurring in 10-20% during the disease. Anxiety, fear, and panicAnxiety is the response to a perceived threat.It manifests as apprehension, uncontrollable worry, restlessness, panic attacks, and avoidance of people and of reminders of cancer, together with signs of autonomic arousal.Patients may overestimate the risks associated with treatment and the likelihood of a poor outcome.Anxiety may also exacerbate or heighten perceptions of physical symptoms (such as breathlessness in lung cancer), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (with intrusive thoughts and avoidance of reminders of cancer) occasionally follow diagnosis or treatment that has been particularly frightening.Certain cancers and treatments are associated with specific fears.Thus, patients with head and neck cancers may worry about being able to breathe and swallow.Patients may develop phobias and conditioned vomiting in relation to unpleasant treatments such as chemotherapy.",

Breakthrough pain is a common and distinct component of cancer pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity, and generally self-limiting with an average duration of 30-60minutes. Despite the self-limiting nature of breakthrough pain, it can place significant physical, psychological, and economic burdens on both patients and their carers. Patients with breakthrough pain are often less satisfied with their analgesic therapy, they have decreased functioning because of their pain, and may also experience social and psychosocial consequences, such as increased levels of anxiety and depression. Successful management of breakthrough pain is best achieved by a thorough assessment which includes determining the severity, pathophysiology, and aetiology of the pain and takes into account both background and breakthrough pains while considering whether the underlying disease, co-morbidities or precipitating events are amenable to interventions. The features of breakthrough pain and the challenges it presents to patients, their carers, and health professionals are illustrated with a case study.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms represent common complications in patients with different types of dementia. Predominantly, they comprise psychosis, agitation and mood disorders, disinhibited behavior, impairment of the sleep and wakefulness rhythm, wandering, perseveration, pathological collecting, or shouting. Their appearance is related to more rapid progression of the disease, earlier institutionalization, use of physical restraints, and higher risk of mortality. Consequently, appearance of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia leads to higher costs of care provided and greater distress for caregivers. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Pharmacological therapy should be initiated only if the symptoms were not the result of somatic causes, did not respond to nonpharmacological interventions, or were not caused by the prior medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used. This review summarizes the current findings about the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementias with psychopharmaceuticals. Recommendations for treatment with antipsychotics for this indication are described in detail as this drug group is prescribed most often and, at the same time, is related to the highest risk of adverse effects and increased mortality.

      "abstract": "Introduction: In schizophrenia prodrome, when symptoms frequently resemble those of depressive illnesses, it creates a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, especially if it is late onset. This also has treatment implications in old age. Case presentation: A 65-year-old female who presented with mood and psychotic symptoms pose diagnostic dilemma. Careful history, collateral examination and continual exploration were done for accurate diagnosis and proper management. Due to overlapping symptoms, the initial diagnosis of psychotic depression was revised to paranoid schizophrenia. Eventually, the detailed examination, neurological and laboratory work up were done and the treatment approach was adjusted. The diagnostic dilemma appeared during the initial stage of the late onset psychosis due to affective symptoms. This case emphasises the critical role of clinical acumen in identifying the possibility of schizophrenia and other psychoses, ruling out organic aetiology and balancing the need of psychotropic drugs in old age.",

      "abstract": "Subjective complaints or somatoform symptoms beyond the case threshold (ICD-diagnoses) occur in 12% of the normal population. In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care. Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

Generally, writer's cramp is characterized by muscular spasm, inco-cordination, and discomfort, variously described as fatigue, weakness, stiffness, or pain when attempting to write. Occasionally, there is an accompanying tremor or jerking of the involved upper limb. There is said to be great variability in the detailed clinical picture. Writing may be difficult or impossible, but outside the act of writing the symptoms generally disappear. Often there are fluctuations within a chronically progressive course but the condition may arrest at any stage of its development.",

Conversion symptoms are often superimposed on organic disease and can be overlooked. Psychological techniques are central to the management of conversion symptoms. Principles of psychological management include the following: avoiding confrontation with the patient; avoiding reinforcement or trivializing the symptoms; reviewing results of tests and exams and creating an expectation of recovery; educating the patient by providing a benign explanatory model of symptoms; evaluating the patient's emotional adjustment and referring for psychotherapy when possible. Use of behavior therapy reinforcement and double-bind psychotherapy strategies may be helpful with more chronic or resistant symptoms, especially when there is a history of vague or excessive somatic complaints or significant secondary gain.

      "abstract": "The concept of allostasis emphasizes that healthy functioning requires continual adjustments to the internal physiological milieu. Allostatic load reflects the cumulative effects of stressful experiences in daily life. When the cost of chronic exposure to fluctuating or heightened neural or neuroendocrine responses exceeds the coping resources of an individual, allostatic overload ensues. So far these issues have been addressed only on pathophysiological terms that do not find application in clinical settings. However, several features that have been described in psychosomatic research may allow the assessment of allostatic load on clinical grounds. Clinimetric criteria for the determination of allostatic overload are suggested. They are based on: (a) the presence of a stressor exceeding individual coping skills, and (b) clinical manifestations of distress. They may provide specification to the fourth axis of DSM, may supplement the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research, and may help discriminate neuroendocrine patterns with important clinical and research implications. A state of allostatic overload is frequently associated with alterations in biological markers and calls for a close medical evaluation of the patient's condition. The ultimate goal is to be able to prevent or decrease the negative impact of excessive stress on health.",

Pain is the cardinal feature of CRPS, but the constellation of symptoms and signs may also include sensory changes, autonomic dysfunction, trophic changes, motor impairment and psychological changes. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture, with additional information regarding the presence of sympathetically maintained pain or autonomic dysfunction being provided by carefully performed and interpreted supplemental tests. Clinical experience supports early intervention with sympatholytic procedures (pharmacological or nerve block techniques), but further scientific data is required to confirm the appropriate timing and relative efficacy of different procedures.

      "abstract": "Bipolar Disorder is characterized with unusal shiftingof mood, frommania to depression and is an extremely risky and very serious mood disorder. The persons behavior may damage both his/her social function and harm the people in his/her environment. Although bipolar disorder recurs during the person\\'s life and thus can manifest at any age, its onset is often observed during early twenties. The difference in prevalence between males and females has not been clearly determined. Although genetics play a role, the disorders cannot be explained by inheritance alone. The disorders has also been explained by disruptions of neurotransmitter balance, in plane words the disruption in the transmission of signals\n. Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder and impairs functioning of the brain. Rationalized decision making and improper reasoning can be seen. Therefore, attention impairments with cognitive content are also on the agenda of bipolarity. Neural basis of bipolar disorder is not clearly known but it is suggested that the right frontoparietal cortex is particularly affected. In bipolar disorder, the concept of right hemisphere dysfunction is not new, it has been originally presented by Flor-Henry (1969, 1979). In this review we aimed to review research exploring hand/foot dominance in the light of this hypothesis. We first aimed to, find studies that measured hand dominance in bipolar disorder to find out whether there were any organizational differences in the brain of people with bipolar disorder. From several articles accessed via Pubmed database Five articles in met the inclusion criteria and were thus included to the review. \nIn general, right hemisphere dominance in bipolar disorder was evident in these studies. However it is also acknowledged that further studies are needed to evaluate whether hand lateralization is related to biological or functional hemispheric asymmetry parameters in patients with bipolar disorder,. It is thought that neuroimaging studies on bipolar disorder patients with dominant left hand, foot and eye will shed light on many points for elucidating the organizational alterations in mental disorders such as bipolarity.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders are cyclical mood disorders with clinical features including distinct sustained periods of mood elevation. Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

      "title": "Persistent postural perceptual dizziness of the elderly",
      "abstract": "Persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of complaints to dizziness and unitability among patients of all-ages. The disease is characterized by a permanent feeling of non-rotatory dizziness or unsteadiness that at first can be caused by an acute vestibular dizziness, somatic disturbance that causes sudden unsteadiness and loss of balance or, for example, by a panic attack. Despite the permanent feeling of unsteadiness and dizziness, a regular instrumental examination cannot reveal important changes that can explain personal feeling. The diagnosis can be made according to the diagnostic criteria developed by the International Barani Society. Treatment consists of psychotherapy, drug therapy and vestibular rehabilitation.Персистирующее постуральное перцептивное головокружение (ПППГ) - частая причина жалоб на головокружение и неустойчивость пациентов всех возрастов. Заболевание характеризуется постоянным ощущением невращательного головокружения или неустойчивости, которое может в дебюте провоцироваться острым вестибулярным головокружением, соматическим расстройством, вызывающим внезапную неустойчивость и потерю равновесия, или, например, панической атакой. Несмотря на перманентное ощущение неустойчивости и головокружения, обычное инструментальное обследование не выявляет значимых изменений, объясняющих субъективные ощущения. Диагноз устанавливается на основании диагностических критериев, разработанных для этого заболевания Международным обществом Барани. Лечение складывается из психотерапии, медикаментозной терапии и вестибулярной реабилитации.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

It is suggested that the extent of such injury is unrelated to the magnitude of shock current and that the timing of the ldquodiffuse electrical injuryrdquo may be indefinitely delayed with respect to the time of the sustained shock. Other reports refer to possible shock injury mechanisms that manifest solely with neuropsychological symptoms. A critical examination of this literature reveals no mechanistic basis for the association of the proposed physical symptoms of diffuse electrical injury with remote injury. Additionally, serious errors in the stated methodology of the publications citing the existence of diffuse electrical injury cast doubt upon the scientific basis for the stated conclusions.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

Kellner's Illness Attitude Scales, self-rating instruments, distinguish between generic worry about illness, concern about pain, health habits, hypochondriacal beliefs, thanatophobia, disease phobia, and bodily preoccupations. The Illness Attitude Scales have been used in a number of studies concerned with patients suffering from DSM-III-R hypochondriasis, panic disorder, melancholia, in the medically ill, in pregnant women, during medical procedures such as mammography, and in experiments in therapeutics, such as drug trials. The results of these studies and of clinical investigations suggest that the differential diagnosis between hypochondriacal beliefs (characterized by resistance to reassurance), disease phobia, thanatophobia, and the other less specific illness attitudes, is worthy of clinical attention and may entail prognostic and therapeutic implications. Pilowsky's concept of abnormal illness behavior, unlike the DSM-III-R, provides a framework for such differentiation.",

      "abstract": "This particular group of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis have suffered a significant degree of intellectual impairment. It appears that the factor having the most unfavorable influence in intellectual recovery is severe clinical illness as evidenced by convulsive seizures. Loss of consciousness for some time during the early phase of tuberculous meningitis in itself does not appear to be a highly unfavorable sign. Nevertheless, when unconsciousness is associated with convulsive seizures the intellectual functioning of the patient, in most instances, can be expected to be seriously impaired. An infant with tuberculous meningitis may be expected to have an unfavorable prognosis aside from any other factors. An older child, who has remained conscious throughout his illness and without convulsions, may be expected to have a relatively good prognosis. Adverse social factors, prolonged hospitalization and isolation, and sensory-motor sequelae are considered to have influenced unfavorably the psychometric scoring of many of these children. Repeat psychometric testing, after an interval, reveals that still further improvement in intellectual functioning may be expected in a number of these children who do not have serious sensory-motor impairment. For the majority, however, repeat testing reveals that they have varied little from their previous performance; the normal children continuing to develop within their normal group whereas the retarded children have remained retarded. It is noteworthy that observations on five adults treated at the Alexandra Hospital have been at some variance with the observations of Williams and Smith who found no measurable disturbance of intellect, personality or memory in 19 adult patients. Three of the five adults treated in this unit have obvious changes in personality in that they are unable to concentrate as formerly, are easily frustrated, childish and frequently quick-tempered. The remaining two patients appear to have no apparent intellectual or personality sequelae. Although this is a study of a small number of children, it is hoped that other workers will undertake psychometric evaluation of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis and make their results known for comparison.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.",

      "abstract": "Summary Comorbidity commonly refers to the cooccurrence (o r dual diagnosis) of two disorders or syndromes in the same patient, regardless of whether the disorders are coincidentally or causally linked. Indeed, illnesses have been classified in discrete diagnostic categories although no sharp discontinuities in symptom distributions are observed across most mental disorders. Depression is a relatively common psychiatric comorbididy of most neurological disorders, with prevalence rates ranging between 20 and 50% among patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Furthermore, depression is an independent predictor of poor quality of life in these patients and has a negative impact on the response to treatment, course and recovery of neurological deficits. Comorbid depressive disorders in neurologic patients can be indistinguishable to the primary mood disorders and may mimic major depression, dysthymic, minor depressive, and bipolar disorders described in the DSMIV classification of mood disorders. In addition, the great overlap of medical and psychiatric symptoms in depression and neurologic disorders may lead to both falsepositiv e and falsenegative diagnoses of depression. Patient with comorbid condition have lower response rate and /or a longer time to response, greater reports of side effect early in treatment and greater likely hood of dropping out. In this review, we focus on comorbid disorder associated with depression.",

      "abstract": "Interest in the distinction between positive and negative symptoms has reached a peak in the last decade and has led to research in different fields like phenomenology, ethiopathogenesis, treatment, course and outcome. Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

Distinct cramp-like sensations and a feeling as if the neck and upper back were in a cast are also described. These head pains and other sensations occur frequently in the forehead and temples or in the back of the head and neck, but in other sites as well. They may be unilateral or bilateral, involving the temporal,",

      "title": "Anxiety Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition",
      "abstract": "The exact cause of the anxiety disorders is unknown. There is, however, considerable evidence that a deep brain structure, the amygdala, is intricately involved with the development of anxiety behavior. The amygdala is thought to mediate the fear response in the brain when an individual is confronted with real or perceived danger [2]. The response of the amygdala to a threat is to create the “fight or flight” response, which includes adrenal catecholamine release, increased heart rate, glycogenolysis, and shunting of blood from the gut. Theory holds that the inappropriate activation or dysregulation of the “fight or flight” response leads to autonomic discharge, which, in turn, produces the symptom complex common to many anxiety disorders. It is frequently recognized that many medical illnesses and conditions are associated with a certain degree of anxiety. The uncertainty surrounding the experience of illness and its treatment can elicit anxiety in many patients, much of which is expected and natural. Exaggeration of the patient’s symptoms, as well as a",

The conditions being as they were, it was impossible to stop symptoms that were evidently due to what we call eyestrain. The causes simply could not be reached.

When stress becomes a prolonged or chronic experience, it can result in psychological distress, including generalized anxiety, burnout, and depressive symptoms. Anxiety, fatigue, burnout, and depression are familiar examples of \"distress\" and evidence has demonstrated that they are associated with prolonged exposure to stressful work. Many studies have shown an association between job strain and some form of psychological distress. Several other studies that have measured job strain and anxiety, often as part of a battery of \"psychological distress\" domains, have shown a positive correlation between high job strain and anxiety. Work-related stress can also be a factor in exacerbating pre-existing mental illnesses and may even precipitate clinically diagnosable symptoms of depression. The work environment is filled with challenges that provoke \"stress\" and engage our adaptive coping abilities.",

The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

Any prescription of drugs modifies the doctor-patient relationship. Drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, act on symptoms and change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; they can create both physical and psychological dependency; they can discourage a deep search for real solutions, both on the part of the doctor and the patient; they can affect the doctor’s access to the patient and the problem will be out of their reach. Psychotropic drugs can make the effect of the doctor in himself as a drug more difficult, favor an insignificant or problematic or little human relational context, where the GP/psychiatrist does not delve into the true meaning of the symptoms, and the patient tends not to get involved, to make an emotional withdrawal, to be passive before the prescribed drug, and can result in the chronification and structuring of functional symptoms that become organic, with lack of cooperation of the doctor and the patient, and paradoxically with over-compliance or therapeutic discontinuity and the lack of pharmacological adherence, absences to appointments or delays or cancellations of visits, and the denial of responsibility of both the doctor and the patient.",

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed.

Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

Generally, acute onset of typical lower motor neuron facial weakness that is not associated with other atypical or suspicious features, remains unilateral, and recovers completely requires no further workup. A recurrent or bilateral peripheral facial palsy makes an idiopathic cause less likely and prompts a more in-depth workup. The appropriate work-up of unilateral or bilateral facial palsy guided by the presence or absence of associated clinical findings is discussed. The major differentials for bilateral facial paresis include brainstem (especially pontine and prepontine) tumors, Lyme disease (especially in endemic areas), basal menigitides, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and sarcoidosis.",

These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

      "abstract": "Abstract Deaths due to positional asphyxia are most often accidental, associated with alcohol and/or drug intoxication. A 19‐year‐old male is reported who was assaulted and placed in a head‐down position in the back of a car were he was later found dead. Brush abrasions indicated that he had been dragged to the vehicle. The head and right shoulder were wedged into the foot well with the body uppermost. At autopsy, there was marked congestion of the face, neck, and upper chest with conjunctival ecchymoses, bruising of the face and scalp, focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, minor cerebral contusion, and diffuse cerebral swelling with early hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ). Toxicology was negative. Death was attributed to HIE resulting from the unusual positioning of the body. Cases of positional asphyxia involving others may not always include restraint, and when encountered should initiate a careful evaluation of the possible events and lethal pathophysiological processes.",

      "abstract": "While pain has traditionally been understood within a medical model that equates pain to tissue damage or disease, this understanding is not consistent with everyday observations of pain or with clinical examples of persistent pain where there is often very little correlation between pain experienced and physical findings. This article considers psychological and multidimensional theories of pain, which are described within the historical context within which they were developed, including behavioural, cognitive, contextual and functional theories. Research into the multifactorial nature of persistent pain has tended to focus on mechanisms of pain development and maintenance or on the function of pain. Psychological approaches, which have focused on mechanism traditionally use disability, mood and quality of life measures to assess outcome, claiming little or no impact on pain intensity itself. By contrast, functional approaches include an explicit goal of reducing pain intensity, which is therefore measured as a key treatment outcome. Strong evidence exists from a range of sources of the important contribution of psychological and social factors to the experience of pain. However, evidence is still lacking about the specific mechanisms of change that are targeted by biopsychosocial interventions and about what treatment approach is likely to work best for whom.",

      "title": "Differential Diagnosis Between Schizophrenia and in Major Depression: The Importance of Abnormal Bodily Phenomena",
      "abstract": "Introduction Anomalies of bodily experience have for long been described as relevant features of schizophrenia and major depression, yet such experiences are usually neglected in clinical examination. Bodily experience is the implicit background of our experiences against which we develop a coherent sense of self as a unified, bounded entity, naturally immersed in a social world of meaningful others. Such tacit experiential background is often perturbed in schizophrenia and major depression. Empirical research shows that patients with schizophrenia and major depression frequently present many different kinds of anomalies of bodily experience in the course of their illness. Objective To characterize the abnormal bodily phenomena in both schizophrenia and major depression. Aim To improve differential diagnosis based on the identification of typical features of abnormal bodily experiences in persons affected by schizophrenia and major depression and to provide supplementary diagnostic criteria. Method Analysis of empirical and theoretical research published in the last 25 years. Result Ongoing bodily feelings of disintegration/violation and nothingness/mechanization (e.g. one's body experienced as a object-like mechanism) are the most typical experiences in people with schizophrenia whereas major depressives are not able to detach themselves from the experience of bodily failure or chrematization (from chrema = corpse, i.e., feeling like a corpse) and therefore, feel worthless, guilty, or decaying. They feel chrematized in their very self. Conclusion These experiences might be considered as specific and they can contribute to differential diagnosis of somatic complaints in schizophrenia and in major depression.

The connection between depression and accompanying painful physical symptoms is not completely understood although some common neurobiological pathways are proposed. To achieve good clinical outcome all depression symptoms should be recognized and treated.

      "abstract": "Summary In normal trained dogs many trivial factors such as strangers in the laboratory, previous noise and confusion in the kennels, changes in the daily experimental routine, an unexpected change of experimenters, or the presence of a female dog in estrus may cause pronounced emotional disturbances resulting in marked and sudden elevation of blood pressure. The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses.

There are few or no objective findings that might explain the \"disease\" or the complaints go beyond what is regarded as \"reasonable\" by the physician. Muscle pain and other types of subjective health complaints are among the most frequent reason for encounters with general practitioners, and one of the major causes for sickness absence. The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required. The difficult thing is that this threshold is individual and subjective. The psychiatric definitions of these complaints, therefore, refer only to the tip of an iceberg.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYModern life imposes several different labor demands on humanbeings; thus, bringing about stressing situations. All those eventsperceived as threatening bringing about tension are called stressors.A stressing situation comes about when there exists a discrepancybetween environment demands and adequate resources to cope withthem. All these factors lead to physiological, cognitive and motorresponses which enhance perception and create the need of bettersolutions to allow appropriate adaptation behaviors.When stress is present at the workplace in a recurrent fashion, itis known as Labor Stress (LS), an alarming circumstance affectingindividuals and organizations. Main causes of LS are: physicalconditions, schedule, work position, interpersonal relations and otherorganizational variables.Labor Stress is a public health and a labor health problem, for itis related to an increase in labor accident, morbidity and absenteeismrates; thus, generating negative attitudes that yield economic loss toinstitutions.The Burnout Syndrome (BS) is a response to chronically laborstress manifested through emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,as well as hostile and aggressive attitudes toward workmates andservice users, resulting in a feeling of poor personal development.ObjectiveAssess the effect of a psycho-educative intervention to decrease BS inmanaging or directive employees from one sector of CFEGuadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.Materials and methodologyA quasi-experimental study was carried out; this included measure-ments prior and after educative intervention carried out on confidenceemployees from CFE Guadalajara from Februa ry through September2005.The study sample was made up of 29 managing or directiveemployees, conforming four groups; one random-selected groupreceived educative intervention; the other three were control groups;different questionnaires were applied: personal data, psycho-socialfactors and BS through the Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale (MBI).From a participativ e-educational view point, encouraged by thePan-American Health Organization (PHO), the educative interventionsought health promotion through the betterment and consistency ofmental and physical wellbeing.All BS concepts as well as psychological factors were analyzed.Other workshop included the development of preventing, coping andtreatment strategies at individual and social levels. F inally, a correctiveprogram directed to decreasing psychological risk factors in theorganization was encouraged. Also, a post-intervention assessmentwas applied.ResultsSubjects had an average age of 31.5 ± 6.8 years; 52% were females;group 1 decreased for all indicators; emotional exhaustion from 71%to 29%; depersonalization from 43% to 14%; lack of personaldevelopment from 57% to 14%. However, no significant differencewas found in both groups by sex.DiscussionIn personnel with specific responsibilities, obligations, opportunities,challenges and rewards based on their performance work environmentoften drives them to frustration and despair. When the employeebelieves that gives more than he receives, he becomes emotionallyexhausted and more even if he do not have the resources to cope withthe prospect of work. Also, it is documented that at younger age thereis an increased risk of presenting the Burnout.This is because interpersonal relationships are more contentiousbecause of the lack of experience in management. In the seriesreported, on both groups we were not able to document thisrelationship, but still, there is a lack of an international consensus torecognize this as a risk factor.Mingote describes that when the employee has less than fiveyears working, they are often idealistic, utopian dreamers, unlikethose with more than ten years in the job and are in risk of experiencingmonotony at work, loss of interest and the downgrade.Also, this type of workers is subject to overtime. This excessproduces physical and mental stress and leads to lower feelings ofpersonal accomplishment. Even though there could be resourcesfor coping with the monotony at work and that provides resources",

There is evidence that depression and other negative emotional states are risk factors for the development of a variety of health outcomes, while serious illness also elicits psychological distress. Comorbid depression and distress are associated with poor outcomes in several chronic illnesses including coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, some cancers, chronic pain and arthritis. The mechanisms linking depression and distress with illness include habitual lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity and smoking, poor treatment adherence, and biological processes including systemic inflammation, adrenocortical and autonomic dysregulation. Screening for depression and distress has been advocated. Treatments of psychological conditions may improve quality of life and emotional state in people with serious illnesses. The evidence for effects of interventions targeting depression and distress on the course of chronic illness is equivocal.",

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally the effectiveness of treatments in psychiatry has been driven by the medical model, where treatment response and remission rates are used as the major measures of efficacy. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting the need for additional measures to complement symptomatic evaluation. Individuals with severe mental illnesses experience impairment across a number of domains of everyday functioning, including social and occupational functioning, residential maintenance, medication management, and basic self-care. This is particularly important since such impairment occurs even in clinical remission periods and may occur immediately after illness onset, worsening with the progressive course. Therefore, the assessment of psychosocial functioning is crucial in individuals with severe mental illnesses, as are the rates of functional recovery, which have been indicated as a further measure of treatment response in investigation setting and clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism/Kallmann syndrome (CHH/KS) is a rare, treatable form of infertility. Like other rare disease patients, individuals with CHH/KS frequently experience feelings of isolation, shame and alienation. Unlike many rare diseases, CHH/KS is not life threatening and effective treatments are available. Nevertheless, it remains a profoundly life-altering condition with psychosocial distress on a par with untreatable or life-limiting disease. Patients with CHH/KS frequently express lasting adverse psychological, emotional, social and psychosexual effects resulting from disrupted puberty. They also frequently experience a ‘diagnostic odyssey’, characterized by distressing and convoluted medical referral pathways, lack-of-information, misinformation, and sometimes-incorrect diagnoses. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment-initiation can significantly contribute to poor body image and self-esteem. Such experiences can erode confidence and trust in medical professionals as well as undermine long-term adherence to treatment - with negative sequelae on health and wellbeing. This review provides a summary of the psychological aspects of CHH/KS and outlines an approach to comprehensive care that spans medical management as well as appropriate attention, care and referrals to peer-to-peer support and mental health services to ameliorate the psychological aspects of CHH/KS.",

      "abstract": "Empirical studies have recently demonstrated that major and minor depressive disorders occur in 30–50% of stroke patients, and last more than one year without treatment, although they do respond to tricyclic antidepressants. These mood disorders are not strongly associated with severity of impairment, demographic characteristics, social supports or prior personal history, but major depression is often strongly associated with left frontal or left basal ganglia lesions and pre-existing subcortical atrophy. While the aetiology of these mood disorders remains unknown, serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction may play a role. Mania is a rare complication of stroke: the clinical presentation and response to treatment are usually the same as mania without brain injury. Post-stroke mania is strongly associated with both a right hemisphere lesion in a limbic-connected area and a second predisposing factor, such as genetic loading for affective disorder, pre-existing subcortical atrophy or seizure disorder. This disorder may be mediated through frontal lobe dysfunction. The lesion method represents a potentially fruitful technique for investigating the mechanisms of affective disorder.",

The diagnosis of such disorders is complex due to the fact that they may appear as medical conditions. Hence, most of somatoform patients do not seek psychiatric assistance. The common feature of somatoform disorders as described in DSM-IV-TR is the presence of physical symptoms suggesting an underlying medical condition that is either not found or does not account for the level of functional impairment. The diagnostic criteria for the somatoform disorders were established for adults and are applied to children for lack of child-specific research base and a developmentally appropriate alternative system. The most common somatoform disorders in children and adolescents are recurrent abdominal pain and tension headache. Other disorders in the category include: somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorder, hypochondriasis and body dysmorphic disorder Treatment is applied through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. SSRI'S are effective in somatoform disorders that have co-morbidity with anxiety and depression as well as in body dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis. Conversion disorder is usually treated with benzodiazepines and pain disorder with light analgesics, tricyclics and tegretol. In terms of psychotherapy, treatments most effective for somatoform disorders have been found to be cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.",

La hipertension arterial es asintomatica, razon por la cual el paciente desconoce la severidad de la misma, constituyendose en un factor de riesgo para la salud. Esta enfermedad cardiovascular esta asociada a diversos factores psicologicos, como el estres, la ansiedad, depresion, hostilidad, ira y bajos niveles de apoyo social. Para el tratamiento de esta patologia, se requiere un proceso de implicacion activa por parte del paciente denominado adherencia terapeutica, que le permite al diagnosticado seguir las recomendaciones y adquirir habitos beneficiosos; la falta de adherencia es una de las principales causas del bajo control de la presion arterial. Existen factores que interfieren en este proceso como son: a. los derivados del paciente (psicologicos): ansiedad, estres, trastornos del estado de animo y rasgos de personalidad tipo a, b. los del entorno socio-economico y cultural (apoyo inadecuado), c. los de la enfermedad (asintomatologia y cronicidad) y d. los del tratamiento farmacologico, servicios de salud y personal que atiende al paciente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl presente articulo tiene como objetivo, establecer la relacion entre los factores psicosociales y las estrategias de afrontamiento empleadas por los pacientes con enfermedad oncologica.

Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

Sjögren’s may vary in its intensity and effects, but there is no cure and it never goes away. Patients with Sjögren’s often look better than they feel, so other people may not believe they are “really” sick. A chronic illness generates stress and uncertainty. Patients do not know what will happen next and can’t predict how they will feel. Anxiety, confusion, frustration, and depression are all common emotions. Challenges brought on by the disease can lead to changes in relationships with family and friends. People may cope well at times, not well at others. Physicians can help validate the changes in patients’ lives and encourage them to maximize a sense of well-being. Despite the challenges, people with Sjögren’s can still lead meaningful, productive lives.",

Their symptoms are called psychosomatic symptoms and include insomnia, fatigue, and weakness. These disorders can also be associated with heartburn, depression, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, pain, cardiovascular problems, gastrointestinal discomfort, erectile dysfunction, a sensation of pressure in the throat, chest problems, hallucinations, and double vision. Somatoform disorders can be an expression of untreated mental pain and life experiences, resulting from serious loss, profound personal injury, or disrespect. Such symptoms occur in almost all humans, but these disorders can have a serious effect in 4–20% of the population.",

      "abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that health threats or actual illness during early infancy may produce psychologic problems in some children, the result of a complex interaction of the mother, the child and the situation. Similar experiences arising later in childhood seem to have a less disruptive effect. Instead of speaking of a \"vulnerable child syndrome\" we might do better with the terms \"neonatal crisis syndrome\" or even the \"ominous infant phenomenon,\" since these broader descriptions allow for the inclusion and expansion of the concepts discussed in this thoughtful set of reflections. Improved attention to these matters is justifiable on the basis of humane considerations alone, and need not await further studies. This may well be a most important area of activity for the pediatrician who seeks to prevent emotional disorders in his patients.",

Accurate recognition and diagnosis is very dependent on the skills of the clinician. This chapter focuses on the assessment of a patient with depression, but highlights the differences between this presentation and that of a patient with an anxiety disorder. A patient attending with physical symptoms may have a comorbid psychiatric illness or somatic symptoms of an underlying depression, which are perceived as a physical illness. Anxiety is an emotion experienced as a normal phenomenon in response to threat or uncertainty. Anxiety disorders occur when anxiety is out of proportion to the threat posed and also impacts on the patient's functioning. Anxiety and depression are recognised as discrete primary disorders. However, there is often some overlap between the two: most depressed patients also have some symptoms of anxiety, and many of those with more severe anxiety disorders will also have some feelings of depression.",

The authors review the clinical examination, classification, and diagnosis of tremor. The pathophysiology of the more common forms of tremor is outlined, and treatment options are discussed. Essential tremor is characterized primarily by postural and action tremors, may be a neurodegenerative disorder with pathologic changes in the cerebellum, and can be treated with a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods. Tremor at rest is typical for Parkinson's disease, but may arise independently of a dopaminergic deficit. Enhanced physiologic tremor, intention tremor, and dystonic tremor are discussed. Further differential diagnoses described in this review include drug- or toxin-induced tremor, neuropathic tremor, psychogenic tremor, orthostatic tremor, palatal tremor, tremor in Wilson's disease, and tremor secondary to cerebral lesions, such as Holmes' tremor (midbrain tremor). An individualized approach to treatment of tremor patients is important, taking into account the degree of disability, including social embarrassment, which the tremor causes in the patient's life.",

This article reviews the neurological and general symptoms and signs that should prompt diagnostic testing and the specific diagnostic studies that are recommended. The worrisome factors include recent head or neck injury; a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt-onset headache; headache brought on by exertion or Valsalva maneuver/cough; new headache in the patient over the age of 50; neurological symptoms and/or abnormal signs; systemic symptoms and/or signs; and secondary risk factors such as a history of cancer or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, side-locked headaches, and prominent effect of change in posture on the pain. The diagnostic investigations include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and blood testing in specific situations.",

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

This impacted on the treatment and appropriate placement of the patient. This case is presented to illustrate the importance of the organic work-up and follow-up on abnormal laboratory results in patients with dementia. In the elderly, a new onset of psychosis is usually associated with an organic cause. Furthermore, the presence of either a fixed or intermittent change in cognitive function suggests a strong likelihood of organicity. These features were present, but not noted, leading to management problems that are described here to illustrate the need for careful clinical scrutiny.",

      "abstract": "Stress can improve an individual's ability to adapt to environmental changes. However, excessive stress can induce stress-related mental disorders, including anxiety disorder, depression disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress can regulate the level of hormones and immune inflammation in the body through the brain network, neural circuits, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, thereby causing the occurrence of mental disorders. In addition, stress can mediate the occurrence of mental disorders by regulating molecular changes in the level of genes, transcription, protein and metabolism, etc. Studies have shown that the brain-gut axis also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of stress-related mental disorders. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of stress-related mental disorders remains unclear. Besides, studies have also shown that the onset of stress-related mental disorders is closely associated with the individual's physiological and psychological qualities,which has a cross-talk with other mental and physical diseases as well. Therefore, it is important to study individual premorbid diathesis clinical, and to conduct clinical medical, basic medical, and psychological studies of the different stages of the disease, so as to obtain further understanding of the pathogenesis of stress-related mental disorders.",

Chronic stress is more complex than most definitions suggest and is clearly not limited to situations in which stressors persist for long periods of time. Responses may habituate before a stressor disappears or may persist long beyond the physical presence of the stressor. This latter case, in which chronic stress and associated biobehavioral changes outlast their original cause, is considered in light of research at Three Mile Island and among Vietnam veterans. The role of intrusive images of the stressor or uncontrollable thoughts about it in maintaining stress is explored.",

Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

      "abstract": "Although Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is still a disease of unknown aetiology psychosocial aspects are involved in the genesis of this disease.Based on experiences in our department and on actual literature psychosocial aspects and therapeutic approaches of HG are presented.Predisposing factors of HG are stress, inadequate information about pregnancy or delivery and problems in the marital relationship. Feelings of ambivalence towards pregnancy, a distorted perception of reality, the unconscious refusing of a wanted child and the worry about a relation between nutrition of the foetus and the HG have influence on the development of the HG. The role of the social context, especially the mother, of expectations towards vomiting and of secondary gain in the genesis and the evaluation of HG is explained. Therapeutical approaches beside the known somatic therapies are acupuncture, the electric stimulation of the N. vestibularis and different methods of psychotherapy, which can include the partner or other persons from the social context. In some cases an intensified therapy under in-patient conditions can improve therapeutic results.Psychosocial factors are involved not only in the genesis of HG, but also in the duration and intensity of symptoms as well as in the resistance especially, towards isolated somatic therapeutical approaches.When psychosocial factors are taken into account in the search for a cause and the treatment of HG results of treatment are more successful and persist over a longer time.",

Many factors contribute to this challenge.

Second, constipation has a multifactorial and complex etiology, including not only anatomical and functional, but also dietary, psychological, and cultural factors. Third, this symptom is still surrounded by misconceptions and taboos, which hamper an objective evaluation and determine self-medication, not always innocuous to the patient. Finally, the patient may either be labeled as having a psychiatric disorder or undergo more aggressive medicamentous therapy by the physician without previous physiologic investigation.",

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms. We summarized relevant findings and provided a review of clinical considerations that physicians can use to aid in the evaluation of psychotic symptoms in the context of those three concepts.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders accompanying digestive system diseases constitute interdisciplinary yet scarcely acknowledged both diagnostic and therapeutic problem. One of the mostly recognized examples is coeliac disease where patients endure the large spectrum of psychopathological symptoms, starting with attention deficit all the way down to the intellectual disability in extreme cases. It has not been fully explained how the pathomechanism of digestive system diseases affects patient's mental health, however one of the hypothesis suggests that it is due to serotonergic or opioid neurotransmission imbalance caused by gluten and gluten metabolites effect on central nervous system. Behavioral changes can also be invoked by liver or pancreatic diseases, which causes life-threatening abnormalities within a brain. It occurs that these abnormalities reflexively exacerbate the symptoms of primary somatic disease and aggravate its course, which worsens prognosis. The dominant mental disease mentioned in this article is depression which because of its effect on a hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal axis and on an autonomic nervous system, not only aggravates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases but may accelerate their onset in genetically predisposed patients. Depression is known to negatively affects patients' ability to function in a society and a quality of their lives. Moreover, as far as children are concerned, the occurrence of digestive system diseases accompanied by mental disorders, may adversely affect their further physical and psychological development, which merely results in worse school performance. All those aspects of mental disorders indicate the desirability of the psychological care for patients with recognized digestive system disease. The psychological assistance should be provided immediately after diagnosis of a primary disease and be continued throughout the whole course of treatment.",

Under pressure from his patient an analyst may unwittingly turn the analysis into a refuge from disturbance, i.e. an enclave. If he succumbs to pressures to move away from, instead of towards, knowing what is psychically urgent, an analyst may turn the analysis into a series of flights, i.e. an excursion. Unrecognized, these deformations interfere with or even halt the therapeutic process, which requires that the analyst find a way of working which accommodates both the patient's communication of, and need for, a refuge or flight with the analyst, while at the same time analysing it.",

Cognitive, behavioural, and psychotic symptoms often occur during mood episodes, and suicide rates in bipolar disorder are among the highest of all psychiatric illnesses.1 Acute bipolar manic and mixed episodes often constitute medical emergencies, requiring admission to hospital to ensure safety and rapid recovery. However, morbidity from mania is not limited to acute episodes as full recovery of functioning often lags months behind remission of symptoms.2 Medications form the cornerstone of treatment of mania, and in the past decade randomised controlled trials of new medications for this syndrome have proliferated. These studies have addressed important questions about the short term efficacy and tolerability of new agents, alone and in combination.\n\nThe efficacy of agents for the treatment of acute mania has typically been established in three to four week, placebo controlled, randomised, parallel group, monotherapy trials in patients admitted to hospital without clinically significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity who are able to give informed consent.

We finally give coverage to the chronic and subthreshold mood disorders, including dysthymia and cyclothymia.

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.",

      "abstract": "Chronic abdominopelvic pain is a debilitating problem that presents challenges to patients and clinicians alike. Symptoms of abdominopelvic pain are among the most commo symptoms presenting to primary care and fall within the scope of a large number of medical specialities, especially gynaecology, gastroenterology, and urology. Such pain can be a warning sign of serious pathology, but chronic abdominopelvic pain must be recognized as a disease in its own right, since it can exist as a chronic condition without identifiable pathology. Traditionally, the management of pelvic pain has focused on biomedical mechanisms such as infective, inflammatory, or malignant conditions; it is now understood, however, that many of the mechanisms are attributable to modulation of pain processing within the nervous system. Although a peripheral stimulus such as inflammation may initiate pelvic pain, the condition or syndrome may become persistent as a result of these mechanisms. Chronic pain syndromes are associated with a variety of cognitive, behavioural, social, sexual, and functional phenomena. These form the basis for diagnosis and must be addressed through multidisciplinary care. Functional disorders, for the purpose of this article, are disorders characterized by disturbance of function (such as urinary urge/frequency in bladder pain syndrome). The term is not used in the sense of a psychiatric functional disorder. Associated psychological disturbances should be considered a result of the disease rather than a cause and there must be an associated conceptual shift, in healthcare providers who work with these patients, to acknowledge this. The authors acknowledge that ongoing organ pathology, such as endometriosis, can produce persistent pain, but the management of specific diseases is beyond the scope of this article. This article will focus on pain syndromes in which no identifiable cause can be found.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

      "abstract": "Syncope is a common presenting complaint in Neurology clinics or Emergency departments, but its causes are sometimes difficult to diagnose. Apart from vasovagal attacks, other benign, neurally mediated syncopes include \"situational\" syncopes, which occur after urination, coughing, swallowing, or defecation.A healthy 42-year-old male patient presented to the neurology clinic with a long history of faints triggered by spontaneous laughter, especially after funny jokes. Physical and neurological examination, and electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging were unremarkable. There was no evidence to suggest cardiogenic causes, epilepsy, or cataplexy and a diagnosis of laughing syncope was made.Laughter-induced syncope is usually a single event in the majority of cases, but may present as recurrent attacks as in our case. Some cases occur in association with underlying neurological conditions. Prognosis is good in the case of neurally mediated attacks. Laughter may not be recognized by physicians as a cause of syncope, which may lead to unnecessary investigations or misdiagnosis, and affect patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is still a real mental health problem; although most epilepsies are curable, their psychopathological consequences are often significant and complex to manage. In this framework, the association of epilepsy with psychotic disorders has long been known.To discuss the links between epilepsy and psychosis, we report the observation of a 52-year-old man, treated for complex focal epilepsy, admitted to a psychiatric department for auditory and visual hallucinations and a behavioural disorder not improved by antiepileptic treatment alone or an antipsychotic alone.Psychotic symptoms in epilepsy can be part of intercritical, post-critical or alternative psychoses. In our patient's case, the psychotic symptoms were post-critical and alternative. It was probably an associated schizophreniform disorder. Emotional indifference and activity restriction are rarely encountered in this setting, while rapid mood fluctuations are frequent. Delusional themes are often mystical, fueled by auditory and unusual visual hallucinations. Negative disorders are rare.Epileptic psychoses have not been identified as nosographic entities in the psychiatric classification systems (DSM-V and ICD-10), which poses a problem in recognizing these disorders. Therefore, a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is necessary to understand this complex comorbidity better, avoid diagnostic errors, and optimize management.",

It is the normal response to the distruption of healthy tissues, but its persistence beyond the period of healing should alert the practitioner to other unrecognized causes. On the other hand, learned pain is a condition resulting mainly from socio-emotional factors in the absence of progressive, invasive and, most of the time, demonstrable pathology. The key to success in the management of a painful condition is an accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate intervention and treatment. A complete history and a detailed physical examination, complemented by ancillary laboratory tests and consultations, when necessary, offer the best approach to initial management. This article discusses the pathophysiology of pain, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic interventions for evaluation and management of pain patients. The role of multiple factors as reinforcers of pain behavior deserves careful attention, and a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach may be indicated in selected cases.",

It is characteristic of many professions, especially professions that involve direct work with people (healthcare, education, army, etc.), and in sports it is almost inevitable. The two most common reasons that cause burnout syndrome are: setting hard-to-achieve goals or unrealistic deadlines and trying to meet other people's (imposed) expectations. In both cases, endurance limits are pushed, which leads to burnout and has consequences for the entire human body and psychophysical health. We live in a harsh age where it is not enough to be successful, the demand is to be the best. This ultimatum is particularly prominent in sports. Athletes are distinguished from others by discipline, perseverance, persistence, focus on the goal (victory), sacrifice and responsibility. Top fitness and top results are always expected from them. The question arises: Is it even possible to achieve top results and avoid the burnout syndrome? In addition to the analysis of causes, symptoms and consequences, the paper seeks an answer to this question.",

The studies discussed in the review elucidate effects of psychological stressors (PS) on diseases such as cancer, AIDS, epidermal abnormalities, obesity, and various inflammatory diseases like colonic inflammations, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), asthma. From these studies, further attempt was made to establish the basic mechanisms which come into play during a stressor stimulus and consequently modulate the physiology of the body. In this review we have highlighted effects of PS on diseases while simultaneously building on the modes of operation of PS to alter physiology and its further implications in developing potential psychotherapeutic methods for disease treatment.",

Childbirth is a major life event known to be associated with large changes in maternal hormones. The determinants of the Blues may therefore be psychological and social, or biological, or both. This paper reviews the relevant literature. Reported associations between Maternity Blues and psychiatric disorder are examined. Possible psychological, social and biochemical determinants are reviewed, but no firm inferences on causation can yet be drawn. Conflicting results in the literature may have been due to variations in definition and measurement of the syndrome. The authors have recently used psychometric methods to develop a questionnaire for detecting and measuring Maternity Blues. By cluster analysis of responses to the questionnaire, a 'Primary Blues' cluster was defined, consisting of 7 items: tearful, tired, anxious, over-emotional, up and down in mood, low spirited, muddled in thinking. The item 'depression' appeared in another less frequent cluster.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a multifaceted disorder characterized by heterogeneous symptom profiles and high rates of comorbidity with other commonly occurring mental illnesses. Considering the burden of mental health disorders and the lack of efficacy of available treatments, there is a need for biomarkers to predict tailored or personalized treatments. However, identifying reliable biomarkers for complex mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD, has been challenging, likely owing to the heterogeneity, comorbidity and differences in experiences and histories of individuals. For these reasons, taking a transdiagnostic approach, which identifies biomarkers that map onto shared symptoms/constructs across disorders could be most effective for informing personalized or precision medicine approaches in psychiatry. Transdiagnostic features of anxiety, depression and anhedonia have been examined in relation to brain activity and connectivity patterns. Neuroendocrine and inflammatory markers, which are altered in depression and other comorbid illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), might be useful in differentiating transdiagnostic symptom profiles as well as treatment responses. Ultimately, biomarker research that looks beyond diagnostic categories and embraces the complexity of individuals' lives and experiences might be more effective in moving towards precision medicine in psychiatry.",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly.

Emphasising similarities between mental illness and ‘ordinary’ experience to escape the fear-related prejudices associated with the imagined ‘otherness’ of persons with mental illness risks conclusions that mental illness indicates moral weakness and the loss of any benefits of a medical model. An emphasis on illness and difference from normal experience risks a response of fear of the alien. Thus, a ‘likeness-based’ and ‘unlikeness-based’ conception of psychiatric stigma can lead to prejudices stemming from paradoxically opposing assumptions about mental illness. This may create a troubling impasse for anti-stigma campaigns.",

Newborn kittens and puppies lack the ability to maintain the body, as a whole, in an upright position. However, by one month of age, the posture of a pediatric patient should mirror that of an adult. Abnormal posture may be due to skeletal, muscular, and/or nervous system dysfunction. A head tilt is a specific type of abnormal posture that occurs with frequency in clinical practice. In dogs and cats, head tilts commonly result from infectious or inflammatory middle or inner ear disease, neurologic insult, or ischemic injury. Head tilts may occur in isolation; however, more commonly they are concurrent with other manifestations of neurologic disease, including ataxia, circling, facial nerve paralysis, falling, leaning, rolling, nystagmus, and/or positional strabismus. The presence of one or more of these clinical signs facilitates prioritization of differentials. This chapter cannot provide an exhaustive review of each clinical sign and differential diagnosis. Instead, the chapter emphasizes those conditions that are most commonly seen in clinical practice: peripheral vestibular syndrome, as caused by otitis media, otitis interna, and old dog vestibular syndrome; central vestibular syndrome, as caused by intracranial neoplasia and metronidazole toxicity; as well as canine hypothyroidism, which causes both.",

      "title": "Best practice in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia",
      "abstract": "Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in most patients with dementia. They cause great suffering in patients and caregivers, sometimes more so than the cognitive and functional decline inherent to dementia. The clinical features of BPSD include a wide variety of affective, psychotic and behavioural symptoms and signs. The causes and risk factors for BPSD are multiple and include biological, psychological and environmental variables. Frequently, their combination, rather than any specific factor, explains the occurrence of BPSD in an individual patient. Thus, a sound etiopathogenetic investigation including the patient and the family or care team is essential. The aim is to develop an individualized treatment plan using a therapeutic decision tree modified by the individual and environmental risk profile. Still, treatment may be difficult and challenging. Clinical empiricism often steps in where evidence from controlled studies is lacking. Psychosocial treatment approaches are pivotal for successful treatment of BPSD. Often a combination of different non-pharmacological approaches precedes drug treatment (most of which is off-label). Regular assessments of the treatment plan and any prescriptions must be carried out to detect signs of relapse and to stop any medicines that may have become inappropriate. Even with optimal management, BPSD will not disappear completely in some cases and will remain challenging for all involved parties. This article is a narrative review based closely on the interprofessional Swiss recommendations for the treatment of BPSD. To establish the recommendations, a thorough research of the literature has been carried out. Evidence-based data were provided through searches of Medline, Embase, ISI and Cochrane-Database research. Evidence categories of the World Federation of Biological Societies were used. Additionally, the clinical experience of Swiss medical experts was considered.",

A multi-factorial aetiology has been proposed, and abnormalities in colonic motility, small bowel motility and visceral sensation have been observed experimentally. More recently, attention has turned to a quite distinct abnormality, namely psychological function. Studies have shown that for a significant proportion of the IBS population, co-morbid psychiatric disturbance may be aetiopathological, with the physical abnormalities described occurring in response to stress or anxiety induced experimentally. Others have suggested that psychological distress may occur as a result of severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and that psychosocial factors may be related to the presentation rather than genesis of the symptoms. Many of these studies contain methodological inadequacies which may adversely affect the results obtained. Comparison between studies, which may provide further insight, is often difficult due to inconsistencies in the experimental protocol and the non-standard ways in which data have been presented. It is likely, however, that differences between methodologies may, in part, explain the variations in results between studies.",

      "abstract": "Despite therapeutic advances, unipolar depression and bipolar disorder are among the most debilitating psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, lacking knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology limit early identification and indicated prevention efforts. Therefore, early characterization of the 'prodromal\" (subsyndromal) stages of depression and, especially, bipolar mania have attracted increasing attention, especially in youth, given the early age of first depression and bipolar disorder symptom onset. Review of phenomenological manifestations of the prodromal stages preceding syndromal unipolar depression and bipolar disorder, including antecedent and comorbid conditions. While offspring mood disorder studies are ongoing, clinical 'high-risk\" mood disorder research is relatively new. So far, retrospective and early prospective data suggest that a clinical prodrome exits in a sizeable patient group of patients subsequently developing unipolar depression and bipolar disorder. Moreover, phenomenologically, the early clinical depression or mania prodrome includes character traits that may become more pronounced, non-specific symptoms of decreasing role and social functioning, as well as subthreshold depressive and/or attenuated (hypo)mania-like symptoms (especially mood swings/lability, racing thoughts and sleep abnormalities). Frequent comorbidities that overlap with mood disorder criteria, the fact that several concurrent supratheshold symptoms can coexist that are still subthreshold for the full mood disorder and the episodicity of emerging as well as full mood symptoms are complicate the identification of the mood disorder prodrome. Data suggest that a relevant proportion of patients ultimately developing unipolar depression or bipolar disorder presents with a clinically identifiable depressive or (hypo)mania 'prodromal\" symptom stage that may enable indicated prevention. Prospective clinical and biological risk marker studies, utilizing specific instruments that target at-risk phenomenology are needed to advance the clinical high-risk and prevention approach for mood disorders.",

The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

While it can indeed be a symptom accompanying other mental illnesses, it is also a full-blown disorder unto itself, recognized by every major diagnostic manual. Chapter 1 discusses the symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder through historical documentation and personal stories. The core symptoms, as outlined in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, include detachment from one’s whole self or from aspects of the self (such as feelings, thoughts, the body, and agency), as well as detachment from the outside world. Origins of the term “depersonalization” are discussed, and historical as well as current descriptions of symptoms are brought to life through personal quotes and stories. These substantiate depersonalization/derealization as an independent syndrome rather than simply a symptom of other disorders. This chapter sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of this fascinating, multifaceted, and under-researched condition.",

      "abstract": "Pain is, according to the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain, an unpleasant, sensory and emotional experience connected to real or possible tissue damage or descriptively in terms of damage. Pain is the most expressed symptom of every clinical picture of oral cavity disease and the reason for the patient to contact his dentist. The feeling of pain is individual, difficult to compare and measure. Depending on the time of its occurence, pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is fast and sharp, it occurs during stimulus application or immediately after the stimulus has been removed. Chronic pain is dull, slow, it appears intermittently or continually, it can be dependent on the stimulus or spontaneous. It presents more character variations than the acute pain. Such patients often come to the dentist's office, complaining about the pain which is not present at that moment. This makes diagnostics harder and widens the spectrum of pathological changes which may cause such pain. Various dental surgeries can cause painful sensations of different character, intensities and duration. It is necessary to diagnose painful sensations and to remove the cause. Prosthetic therapy can cause physical pain in many clinical phases, however, physical pain is also connected to prosthetic rehabilitation due to disrupted chewing, phonetic and aesthetic function which is ensured by a healthy and sanitized stomatognathic system. The fear of uncertainty of functioning and aesthetics without prosthetic work during the therapy implementation and the fear and uncertainty of the new prosthetic work has great effect on the patient's behaviour. The 'new' smile changes the patient's facial appearance. One becomes aware of that and engages himself in conversation with others more confidently. Properly performed prosthetic therapy raises self-confidence of a patient and can open up new opportunities in life. This is achieved by a therapist who can correctly and individually indicate prosthetic work and recognize the personality of a patient and thus adapt the way of communication during therapy. A dentist should not fear painful sensations that a patient complains about, but using his knowledge make the correct diagnosis, recognise his possible mistake at work and as fast and as more efficiently as possible reduce the feeling of pain.",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents.

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

Dizziness and vertigo may be the result of trauma to the peripheral vestibular system or the central nervous system, or, in some cases, may be due to anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder; these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. While most peripheral vestibular disorders can be identified by testing and examination, those without inner ear causes that have persisting complaints of dizziness and motion sickness are more difficult to understand and to manage. Some of these patients exhibit features compatible with vestibular migraine and may be treated successfully with migraine preventative medications.

Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase.

In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "abstract": "Depression is a major public health problem. According to the World Health Organization (OMS), depression is currently the second cause of disability in developing countries. Depression is also one of the most frequent mental illnesses. When treating depression, the main objective is to achieve complete remission and to prevent recurrence. Unfor-tunately, in clinical practice, this aim is particularly difficult to reach. Indeed, in clinical trials and in naturalistic studies, remission levels are rather low. The challenge is to individualize the treatment of depression taking account clinical specificities, but also advances in the field of biological and genetic research. Today, intense psychiatric research tries to discover biomarkers to predict treatment response. Because individuals are highly different from a biological, psychological and sociological point of view, more personalized therapeutic approaches are recommended.",

In a consensus meeting the following terms were defined: a normal feeling of depression, depression as a symptom and depression as an illness. The use of the term 'masked depression' was advised against. The undertreatment mentioned is caused by the following factors: presentation of physical symptoms by depressive patients, unfamiliarity of patients with depressive disorders and difficulties of patients and GPs in labelling depression as mental. Depressive disorders have various causes. For scoring the severity of depression the Bech version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is preferred. There is no valid laboratory test for diagnosing depression. Laboratory tests are recommended to exclude physical disorders, for choosing an antidepressant and for the follow-up of drug treatment. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Interpersonal Therapy are preferred psychotherapeutic methods because of their scientifically proved efficacy. Women suffer from depression twice as frequently as men, which is due to social factors rather than to genetic or hormonal factors. Therefore hormonal therapy is not indicated, a more equal doctor-patient relationship is. Patients with a depressive disorder may consider suicide; this should regularly be discussed with them.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

With respect to the distinction between psychological and somatoform manifestations of dissociation current data suggest a hypothesis to which extent mild manifestations of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms in healthy young population may be linked to stress-related psychopathological symptoms or whether these symptoms more likely could be attributed to unexplained somatic factors. With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

This preoccupation causes significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other functioning. Social anxiety is a prominent component of BDD, and social avoidance resulting from BDD symptoms may markedly impair social functioning. In severe cases, avoidance of social situations in combination with occupational and academic impairment may result in patients becoming housebound. The prevalence of BDD is 1% to 2% in the U.S. population and 11% to 12% in patients with social anxiety disorder. Behaviors associated with BDD include mirror checking, physician visits, hair grooming, use of cosmetics, and social avoidance. Distress over BDD may lead patients to undergo repeated cosmetic surgeries in futile attempts to conceal or correct perceived defects. Additionally, depression and suicide are frequent complications of BDD. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for the management of BDD with coexisting social anxiety are presented in this article.",

Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established.

      "abstract": "he problems of coping with adolescence are greatly increased by an additional chronic disorder.This is particularly so for those with epilepsy, where there is social stigma and the need for potentially sedative and damaging medication.Epilepsy is the most common neurological condition among patients transferred from paediatric to adult care.Many of the problems encountered in the teenager with epilepsy are shared by those with other chronic disabilities. 1 2 This review considers the paediatric environment that the adolescent is leaving, the rationale for a teenage clinic, and the facets of this which make it a desirable facility. c THE TEENAGER WITH EPILEPSYEven when relatively mild, the impact of epilepsy on the teenager and on other members of the family may be profound.Epilepsy has important differences from other chronic disorders, particularly that the disability is intermittent, and so can be hidden.The perceived need to conceal epilepsy, and concern about seizures occurring in public, can induce great anxiety.The consequences of missing epilepsy, or treating it inappropriately, can be disastrous in terms of impaired education, employment, and driving prospects, unnecessary medication, and diminished self esteem.Perhaps these factors are of greater importance for teenagers than for those in other age groups: c Developing independence is impeded, education is at a critical stage, employment and driving prospects are just being realised, and issues of relationships, contraception, pregnancy, and parenthood are becoming increasingly relevant.c Deviations from peer group norms hold great importance for teenagers: epilepsy can be disastrous for self esteem and self identity.c Social handicaps acquired in childhood and adolescence can remain with the individual even after seizures have been adequately controlled.Complete control achieved before adult social and vocational responsibilities can help to avoid these problems.A relatively aggressive approach to treatment, including early consideration of epilepsy surgery, is therefore justified. THE TEENAGER CLINICTaking over a patient's care offers opportunities to reassess the diagnosis by reviewing the history, and to ensure appropriate investigations are to hand.This is best done in the setting of a specialist teenager epilepsy clinic.Developing teenagers often find paediatric clinics embarrassing and inappropriate.A transitional arrangement offers the benefit of consulting both an adult and a paediatric neurologist, supported by an epilepsy specialist nurse. 3The general principles of a teenager epilepsy consultation are listed in box 1.Two main patient groups are referred to this type of clinic: c Patients presenting with blackouts beginning as teenagers (referred from general or hospital practice) where the main initial issue is diagnosis.c Patients with ongoing and often complex epilepsy from childhood (referred from general paediatrics or paediatric neurology) where the main issue is ongoing management of the epilepsy.The following should be addressed at first contact: c Is the diagnosis of epilepsy correct?c If the diagnosis is epilepsy, which type is it?c Is the current epilepsy management appropriate?c Is there appropriate knowledge and understanding of the condition, its prognosis, and its lifestyle implications?In particular, will the seizures interfere with completion of education, training for a career/job, or qualification for a driving licence, and are there special social circumstances that need to be addressed? IS THE DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY CORRECT?A correct diagnosis is essential for the appropriate management of any patient with blackouts.Despite major advances in the technology for investigating blackouts, the most important investigation remains the taking and re-taking of the clinical history.",

The elderly also face a high level of psychosocial and physical stress. In addition, the clinical presentation may be complex and difficult to diagnose, as many of the classical signs and symptoms may be absent or exacerbated. Many of the diagnostic norms may not apply to the elderly, as the concept of being well differs when comparing young with older people. Drug effects in the elderly fluctuate and are much more unpredictable. The elderly patient may present in a confusional state caused by unexplained drug effects. For varying reasons, elders suffer from unwanted drug effects more frequently than do younger adult patients. Assessment of the health status of the elderly must be based on the understanding that problems of living, general health factors, diseases of adaptation, and a decrease in the efficiency of several organ systems combine to determine that status.",

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the association between depression and PD are not clearly understood, and it is hypothesised that changes in brain pathology, neurotransmitter signalling pathways and, particularly, abnormalities of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic projections may substantially contribute to its development.1 Psychological factors, life stresses and internal perception of PD as a devastating neurodegenerative condition with no effective cure may also contribute to the development of depression in patients with PD.

      "title": "Focused Neuroregulation in the Treatment and Prevention of Mental and Physical Illness",
      "abstract": "Despite the enormous strides that have been made in neuroscience, the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Consequently, various forms of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and neuromodulatory therapy continue to be applied without a clear understanding of what pathological process is being treated. However, an emerging hypothesis contends that psychiatric symptoms are the consequence of pathological hyperactivity in symptom-related circuits in the brain. According to the Multi-Circuit Neuronal Hyperexcitability (MCNH) Hypothesis of Psychiatric Disorders, persistent firing in anxiety circuits causes persistent feelings of anxiety; persistent firing in depressive circuits causes persistent feelings of depression; persistent firing in cognitive circuits causes ruminative and obsessive thoughts; etc… This pathological circuit-specific hyperactivity is believed to be caused by an inherent failure of the neurological system to self-regulate when perturbed by a psychological, emotional, or biological stressor. Based on this hypothesis, it would not be unreasonable to think that psychiatric symptoms, irrespective of which disorder was being treated, would respond favorably to any natural or medicinal intervention that reduces the excitability of the neurological system. Although the use of brain-calming drugs in psychiatry is not new, what is new is the idea of focusing their use on correcting a specific physiological abnormality that is believed to underlie the symptoms. This technique, which could be called “Focused Neuroregulation,” would differ from standard pharmacotherapy in that if one anticonvulsant failed to alleviate or only partially alleviated symptoms, another anticonvulsant would be substituted or added rather than turning to an off-target class of drugs. This approach is clinically valid because each anticonvulsant is structurally different, and there are multiple mechanisms (and receptors) through which the excitability of the neurological system can be therapeutically regulated. Also, anticonvulsants, unlike other classes of psychotropic drugs, tend to bring the system back into balance; hence the term “mood stabilizers.” Yet another benefit of Focused Neuroregulation is that it could help prevent or slow the progression of the many chronic health conditions that have been linked to an inherent hyperexcitability of the neurological system. In recognition of these potential benefits, and in an effort to avoid the many problems that are associated with the symptom-based treatment of psychiatric and related functional symptoms, the aim of this article is to incentivize the study of a more targeted approach to the treatment of mental illness and the prevention of chronic disease.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a complex condition that is characterized by chronic widespread pain and multiple other symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, stiffness, and depressive episodes. Fibromyalgia may coexist and/or overlap with other conditions that may involve central sensitivity, including chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis, and temporomandibular disorder. The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia remains uncertain but is believed to be partly the result of central systems affecting afferent processing as well as impaired endogenous pain-inhibitory systems. Abnormal central nociceptive processing may contribute to fibromyalgia, producing heightened responses to various noxious stimuli with resulting mechanical hyperalgesia. Fibromyalgia remains a clinical diagnosis. There has been a recent paradigm shift away from requiring 11 or more out of 18 tender points and instead focusing on the presence of chronic widespread pain as well as symptoms of fatigue, unrefreshed sleep, and other somatic complaints. Although there is no known cure for fibromyalgia, multidisciplinary team efforts using combined treatment approaches, including patient education, aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapies (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [eg, duloxetine, milnacipran] and alpha 2-delta receptor ligands [eg, pregabalin]) may improve symptoms as well as function of patients with fibromyalgia.",

A lifetime prevalence of approximately 17% has been widely reported, and the likelihood of recurrence is more than 50%. A conceptual shift has occurred in our understanding of depression. It is now seen as a chronic medical disorder that produces as much functional limitation and morbidity as chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Predictors of chronicity include long duration of index episode, relationship difficulties, low family income, admitting research center, and inpatient hospitalization. Risk factors for recurrence include lack of self-confidence, neuroticism, previous hospital admission, loss events, and age. The aim of treatment is to induce a stable, fully asymptomatic state with full restoration of psychosocial function and to establish a long-term state of wellness. Despite effective pharmacotherapy, depressed patients are often underdiagnosed and undertreated by both psychiatrists and primary care physicians. The psychosocial and physical impairment, comorbidity, and high suicide rate associated with chronic, recurrent depression require optimal treatment strategies. The future of antidepressant treatment should focus on remission or getting the patient well and drugs that will induce and maintain long-term recovery.",

It overlaps with frontal brain aging consequences. Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "Demoralization is a common psychiatric phenomenon among medically ill patients which presents as distress, subjective incompetence, hopelessness, and with feelings of rejection. Although it is common among medically ill patients, demoralization is often not recognized or diagnosed by non-psychiatric and psychiatric providers alike, especially in the setting of other psychiatric and medical comorbidities. In this article, we aim to show clinical differentiation of demoralization from other common mood disorders and a relatively similar psychiatric phenomenon such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study consists of a literature review and a case of a 55-year-old female with demoralization and comorbid PTSD in the setting of a long-term hospital stay due to multiple medical problems. We demonstrate the clinical presentation, differentiation, and treatment of demoralization with co-morbid PTSD. This literature review and case presentation is a unique opportunity to highlight the importance of recognizing and treating demoralization as a distinct and important clinical syndrome concurrently with other presenting psychiatric conditions such as PTSD. Better recognition and diagnosis of demoralization in clinical settings will likely help providers, especially in non-psychiatric medical services, have a better understanding of these patients and aid in communication and treatment in a way that can avoid reflexive use of pharmacological agents, prevent inadvertent negative perceptions of patients, and allow for incorporation of actionable therapeutic methods as part of the general treatment plan independent of involvement from Psychiatry.",

Research into chronic fatigue syndrome demonstrates possible psychiatric or organic causes. The truth may be somewhere in between. Evidence for the existence of an ongoing chronic infection is now not convincing. Treatment should be based on supportive counselling, explanation, psychiatric help (both pharmacological and non pharmacological) and a graded programme of increased activity with the eventual aim of resumption of full functioning.",

In contrast to other rhythmic bioparameters, the diurnal BP rhythm is largely dependent on activity and sleep rather than on clock time. This has been demonstrated by the BP characteristics after shifted sleeping and working phases, during transition from sleep to wakefulness, and by the influence of sleep and activities on the 24-h BP curve during normal daily routines. Whereas the circadian rhythm of BP is predominantly governed by external time triggers, endogenous rhythmicity can only be detected by time microscopic analysis or in conditions where effects of external time triggers are almost excluded.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a common yet frequently overlooked psychiatric symptom in patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis (HD). Anxiety is characterized by disruptive feelings of uncertainty, dread, and fearfulness. A variety of common medical complaints may be manifestations of an anxiety disorder, including palpitations, tremors, indigestion, numbness/tingling, nervousness, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and fear. It is essential for the clinician to rule out specific medical conditions, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic diseases, before ascribing these symptoms to an anxiety disorder. In addition, there is considerable overlap between the symptoms of anxiety and those of depression and uremia. This psychiatric condition has a significant adverse impact on patients’ perception of quality of life. Little is known regarding the prevalence and impact of anxiety disorders in patients with ESRD treated with HD; however, many of the seemingly irrational behaviors of patients, or behaviors which place them in conflict with staff and physicians, such as behavioral noncompliance, may be the expression of an underlying anxiety disorder. In this review, we present three clinical vignettes, highlighting the impact of anxiety disorders in patients with ESRD treated with HD.",

      "title": "The evolution of early psychosis with variable expression. Study of a clinical case",
      "abstract": "It is the study of a clinical observation, over a period of two years, of a 21-year-old man who often presented himself at the emergency room for severe anxiety and behavioral disorders characterized by repeated self-mutilation, psychomotor agitation, homicidal behavior toward his father, aggressive impulsivity, and sometimes antisocial behavior (running away and dangerousness). Ideas of persecution and reference often underlay his disordered behaviors. The patient also made frequent suicide attempts related to brief depressive periods, in which he verbalized great suffering that he explained by family relational difficulties and traumatic events (parental abuse, accidents). After two years, the clinical picture was aggravated by the appearance of symptoms of schizophrenia comprising paranoid delusion, hallucinations with mental automatism, social withdrawal, and affective and behavioral disorganization that had completely replaced his self-aggressive acting-out. These polymorphic symptoms initially posed a diagnostic and therapeutic problem for psychiatrists due to their persistence and repetition; these were made more complex by the sexual and identity problems that were later revealed through psychotherapeutic observation.The observation consisted of attentive listening during regular psychotherapeutic interviews that allowed to retrace the evolution of this pathology and his stabilization. The goal was to construct a clinical and evolutionary perspective taking into account the progression of symptoms over time until the onset of psychosis. Despite us being limited by a neurobiological exploration that yielded no apparent results, the semiotic analysis of the patient’s symptoms, writings, and symbols allowed us to research the different precocious phases of the disease, as well as the psychopathological analysis of his symptoms.Results: This method allowed us to determine the first symptom, to identify the initial period of disorders and their relationships with vulnerability factors (parental trauma, genetics), to describe their evolution according to age, and to trace the symptoms of psychotic transition. Our aim was to emphasize the preventive role of early treatment of prepsychotic disorders. We consider the impact of anxiety on the patient's neuropsychic development and on the genetic origins of the disease.Conclusion: We emphasize the preventive approach, which consists in detecting the subjects at risk of psychotic transition and determining an appropriate psychotherapy to avoid any recurrence or aggravation of the disorders.",

Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue and history and investigations should always be individualized. Management should initially aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes; however, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered. For optimal management the multidimensional components of fatigue should be assessed and future research is needed on the use of non-pharmacological treatment such as physical activity, counselling, and/or pharmacological agents such as a trial of psychostimulants or short course of corticosteroids.",

Although such knowledge may ultimately help determine the underlying causes of schizophrenia, the principal concern of practicing clinicians should be to diagnose and treat medical comorbidity in individual patients. Nearly 50% of patients with schizophrenia have a comorbid medical condition, but many of these illnesses are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. A fragmented health care system, lack of access to care, patient inability to clearly appreciate or describe a medical problem, and patient reluctance to discuss such problems all contribute to the lack of attention to medical problems in patients with schizophrenia. Psychiatrists and primary care practitioners who treat patients with schizophrenia should make an effort to uncover medical illnesses by using a structured interview or routine physical examination whenever a patient is seen for care.",

Therefore, the aim of this review paper was to contribute towards a more coherent view on hypochondriasis, which would also allow its more adequate classification. The essential features of hypochondriasis were identified as an overvalued idea about the presence of disease, fear that the person has already become seriously ill, reassurance-seeking and other forms of health checking, and disturbances in the perception of bodily sensations and symptoms. These four aspects of hypochondriasis can be assessed dimensionally to ascertain to what extent they characterise each patient. Suggestions have been made to delineate more precisely hypochondriasis from health anxiety, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other somatoform disorders, personality disorders, depression, and delusional disorder with disease-related delusions. In the absence of better alternatives, hypochondriasis should continue to be classified among the somatoform disorders. In order to improve communication between clinicians and reduce conceptual heterogeneity, the term 'hypochondriasis' should be used to refer only to primary hypochondriasis. The pressure to abandon this term should be resisted until an adequate substitution for it has been found.",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "abstract": "A t some point in their careers, most neurologists encounter patients who they find difficult to help. 1,2This experience may arise as a natural reaction to the challenging diagnostic and therapeutic work that so often is a part of work in the clinical neurosciences.Reports of the physician's reactions to difficult patient encounters appear infrequently in the neurology literature but, when offered, are informative and useful. 3Their publication cuts through the sense of being the only one to face such difficult experiences and provides an opportunity to learn from them both personally and in discussion with colleagues.Other patients are experienced as difficult because the neuropsychiatric sequelae of their neurologic conditions, comorbid psychiatric problems, and/or other challenging behaviors provoke strong reactions in the neurologist and his or her staff.Physician reactions in these encounters run the gamut of emotions, but frequently include aversion, anxiety, hopelessness, and anger, and may sometimes even include feelings of malice. 4These kinds of reactions to patients, and sometimes to their caregivers, complicate and can compromise one's ability to provide neurologic care. 1,2,5n the midst of a strong negative reaction to a difficult encounter with a patient or caregiver, one may be tempted to consider dismissing that patient from one's practice.There are circumstances in which such dismissals of patients from neurologic practices are necessary. 1However, patient dismissals are logistically complicated, stress and strain an already damaged physician-patient relationship, and may result in legal and regulatory penalties for the physician if done improperly.Most importantly, the dismissal itself is rarely in the patient's best interest: it fails to address the cause of the patient's behaviors, results in the transfer of a highly upset patient to an entirely unsuspecting or unprepared colleague, and almost ensures that the patient will repeat an aggravated and aggravating process with that physician.With this in mind, patient dismissal is the response of last resort to a difficult neurologist-patient interaction. 1,6 more practical and productive response to difficult interactions with patients requires the neurologist first to reflect on the potential causes.In most cases, the problem is not most correctly or usefully framed as an encounter with a \"difficult\" patient.Instead, the problem generally arises out of a set of challenging health care system factors, patient factors, and physician factors. 6HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FACTORS Patients that physicians label as \"difficult\" tend to be more functionally impaired, higher utilizers of health care systems, and less satisfied with the care they receive than patients who physicians rate as \"less difficult.\" 7Concurrently, system-wide pressures to decrease health care costs and From the Neurobehavioral Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry (D.B.",

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is lower in older adults, it still accounts for a significant proportion of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and the public health impacts of bipolar disorder are likely to rise given the aging of the population. Late‐onset bipolar disorder (especially mania) is more likely to be associated with comorbid neurological and medical illnesses. Bipolar disorder is treated with psychiatric medication including a mood stabilizer such as lithium. Additional structured psychosocial treatments, especially cognitive–behavioral therapy, may be helpful in maintaining mood stability, reducing or minimizing the severity of future episodes, reducing the likelihood of harmful social and work consequences, and improving functioning.",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder and one of the most debilitating and baffling mental illnesses known. It is a disease that makes it difficult for a person to tell the difference between real and unreal experiences, to think logically, to have normal emotional responses to others, and to behave normally in social situations. People with schizophrenia may also have difficulty in remembering, talking, and behaving appropriately. Schizophrenia is one of the more serious mental illnesses and can have a variety of symptoms. This illness varies in its severity from one individual to another, and also within any one afflicted individual from one time period to another. Sometimes these symptoms come on suddenly, but most often, the illness develops slowly over months or even years. At first, symptoms may go unnoticed or may be confused with those of other conditions. For example, people with Schizophrenia may feel tense, be unable to concentrate, or have difficulty sleeping. Those afflicted also become increasingly isolated and socially withdrawn. As the illness progresses, the symptoms often become more bizarre, and are described as symptoms of psychosis. The person develops peculiar behavior, speaks nonsensically, and may develop hallucinations, that is, they may see, feel, smell, or hear things that are not really there. During the psychotic phase, people with Schizophrenia may also suffer from delusions, i.e., have thoughts that are fragmented, bizarre, and have no basis in reality. They may also develop disordered thinking and speech patterns in which the associations among their thoughts and words are very loose. Schizophrenia seems to worsen and improve in cycles known as relapses and remission, respectively. At times, patients may appear relatively normal, but usually there will be repeated episodes of the illness that will cause the symptoms to reappear. It is one of the most common serious illnesses that can cause repeated hospitalizations. Antipsychotic medications (often called neuroleptics) are very effective in controlling the symptoms of the illness. Because each person with Schizophrenia has a unique mix of symptoms no single medication works best for all people. Also, there is a high percentage of patients who do not comply with their medications due to bad side effects that they could not tolerate. However, a new generation of these antipsychotic medications has been shown to reduce the side effects, and more significantly has improved the quality of life of patients. Because of these new drugs, patients now are more integrated into society, some of them are able to graduate from college and many are gainfully employed and productive members of our society.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive alterations accompany or follow motor disorders in subjects with Parkinsonism. The canonical phenotypeof the Parkinson's disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executiveand visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness,or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associatedwith cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing thecognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition,recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it moreand more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathologymay support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is verylikely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow commonpatterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share aprion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

Tremor may be either physiologic or pathologic and can be classified as postural, rest and action tremors. This classification helps in determining the cause of tremor types. The most common disorders with tremor will be discussed in this review. Besides detailed questioning of the tremor; daily activities, drug, alcohol use and metabolic diseases should be asked while interviewing the patient. Physical examination should include careful inspection in different positions. Presence of other neurologic findings should also be checked for. Essential tremor is the most common tremor disorder, with a prevalence of 1-6 %. Mild and non-disability tremors don’t always warrant therapy. The treatment of tremor primarily involves pharmacotherapy. The most frequently used drugs are propranolol and primidon. If there is no history of alcohol and/or drug use in kinetic tremor, patients should be referred for evaluation of cerebral or cerebellar lesions. Management of tremor can be difficult because of different possible causes. However, differential diagnosis is possible with medical history and physical examination only. Therefore, detailed evaluation in primary care is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of tremor.",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting.

Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas. El cuadro clínico de los ataques de cefalea incluye los datos siguientes: son por lo general difusas o bifrontales; empiezan abruptamente en cualquier momento y duran desde minutos a varias horas; en la mayoría de los casos se acompañan de nauseas y vómitos y se siguen de letargia postictal y sueño; no existen factores desencadenantes y responde a los anticonvulsilantes. Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Psychophysiology is just as closely related to internal medicine as it is to psychiatry. “Psychological variable” has two distinct meanings: a) an external sensory stimulus, or b) an organismic state described in psychological language. “Psychological” and “Physical” are names of two different languages. There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity. There are many problems in medicine which psychophysiology could help to solve.",

      "title": "Presenting Symptoms of Pituitary Apoplexy",
      "abstract": "Abstract The classical term “pituitary apoplexy” (PA) describes a clinical syndrome usually characterized by abrupt onset of headache accompanied by neurologic and/or endocrinologic deterioration due to sudden expansion of a mass within the sella turcica as a result of hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor and adjacent pituitary gland. PA is a medical emergency and a difficult diagnosis to establish. Thus this article reviews the presenting symptoms of PA patients to help clinicians recognize or at least suspect this critical condition early on. PA commonly occurs in the setting of a preexisting adenoma, and several patients are unaware of its existence prior to the onset of apoplexy symptoms, which are mainly of a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic nature. Neurologic symptoms include sudden-onset severe headache and other symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms from compression of the cavernous sinus contents, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. Ophthalmologic symptoms include visual field defects, visual loss, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. Endocrinologic disturbances include pituitary adenoma symptoms, cortisol deficiency, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice to aid the PA diagnosis. Its differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accidents, infectious diseases, and other causes of endocrinologic imbalance. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice, especially if there are associated visual abnormalities and ophthalmoplegia. Clinicians should be aware of the presenting symptoms because early diagnosis may reduce the morbidity and mortality of this neurosurgical emergency.",

      "abstract": "The developmental epilepsies are distinctive in that they occur in a dynamic and plastic substrate. A variety of acquired insults may present with remarkably similar seizure syndromes that are age-specific and evolve with time. This evolution may be a consequence of the brain injury itself or an alteration of normal brain maturation due to an unfavorable electrical environment. Idiopathic epilepsies are now being correlated with specific gene defects, particularly those involving ion channels and/or neurotransmitter receptors. Despite this specificity, idiopathic seizure syndromes may be caused by mutations in different genes or different mutations in the same gene, and particular syndromes may manifest heterogeneous clinical seizure types. Not all localization-dependent epilepsies are symptomatic, as a growing number of genes have been identified with partial seizure syndromes. Febrile seizures probably do not represent a homogeneous entity, but multiple disorders that may be associated with developmental abnormalities and various coexisting seizure types.",

      "title": "Psychological parameters of psoriasis",
      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory scaling dermatosis. The marked visible appearance of the lesions have a negative impact on body image that leads to decreased self-esteem, hence seriously compromising the patient's quality of life. The clinical picture critically affects the social well-being of the patient since the disease is commonly misunderstood and feared by the social environment as being contagious. The patient feels stigmatized and this further intensifies their lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. Feelings of shame and guilt increase the tendency toward suicidal ideation. The poor quality of life of psoriatic patients has been associated with excessive alcohol consumption, increased smoking and greater use of tranquilizers, sedatives and antidepressants. As far as mental impairment is concerned, a correlation has been found between psychological stress and the clinical severity of symptoms: the more mentally affected the patient, the more severe the dermatologic lesions. Similarly, stressful life events constitute a major risk for the occurrence and recurrence, exacerbating the severity and duration of the symptoms. Depression and anxiety can worsen the disease or cause resistance to treatment or patient's indifference, which in turn can lead to expensive and prolonged treatment. Not least, the disease itself contributes to anxiety, depression and psychological stress, thus creating a \"vicious circle\" that is difficult to manage. Given that women seem to invest more in their personal appearance than men, it is hardly surprising that female psoriatic patients report higher levels of depression. Similarly, the risk of mental disorders is also higher in younger patients for whom body image plays an equally significant role. The severity of the disease, side effects of therapy and mental disorders are among the causes that have been attributed to sexual dysfunction reported by some psoriatic patients. At the social level, stigma, social rejection, feelings of shame, embarrassment and lack of confidence provoked by the disease often lead to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal. This review attempts to describe the prevalence of psychological stress and its negative social impact on patients with psoriasis. The recognition and treatment of these psychosocial problems may contribute to improving the quality of life for patients and reduce treatment costs. The collaboration between the psychiatrist and the dermatologist is a fundamental prerequisite toward addressing these issues.",

      "title": "Duloxetine in the Treatment of Depression: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disorder that can be classified in the categories of non-organic psychiatric disorders and mood disorders. Mood tone is an important psychic function involved in the adaptation to both our internal and external world. It is flexible, that is, it goes up when we are in positive and favorable conditions, but it goes down when we are in negative and unpleasant states. We can define depression as a condition when mood tone loses its flexibility, it goes down and its no longer influenced by favorable external events. In fact, depression is characterized by changes in the way how the affected individual thinks, feels and acts. Even if this change occurs gradually, a depressed subject is not the same as before. For example, a brilliant student could be persuaded to be not able to finish his studies; an affectionate mother could start to neglect her sons; an enterprising worker could lose every interest for his activity. Moreover, a depressed person doesnt care of his aspect or of himself. The surviving instinct could leave place to the desire to stop his own life. The most evident characteristic of depression in the adulthood is a sad mood, a gloomy solitary and apathetic attitude. A depressed subject could cry also with no apparent reason, he could have difficulty falling asleep or he could wake up very early in the morning and no longer returns to sleep. Or, instead, he could sleep more than usually and he could feel tired persistently. He could lose appetite and weight, or, in some cases, he could eat much more than usually and he could gain weight. Typically, a depressed person feels himself in a extremely negative way, he could think to be hopeless and helpless and he often condemns himself for small guilty. A depressed subject is pessimistic about himself and his own future; he loses interest in all what happens around him and he gets no satisfaction from the activities that before were pleasant. Some persons can be depressed also if they dont show evident signs of depression, but they complain for physical symptoms or they abuse of alcohol or other substances. It has been estimated that in the industrialized Western world one to six persons has a depressive episode at least once during his life; at present, the incidence of depression in the general population is around 5% with clear cut prevalence in the female sex. This leads to high social costs: behind the short-term inability, we have to consider also the long term inability (it has been estimated that, in 2020, depression will represent the second most frequent cause of permanent inability) as well as the suicide risk, the proved major susceptibility of depressed subjects to various non-psychiatric pathologies and the increased rate of premature deaths of depressed individuals as compared to the general population. The present work not only evaluates the drugs used for the treatment of depression, but it focuses also on those studies that investigated the efficacy of a second generation drug: Duloxetine that has a higher selectivity of action and a better tolerability profile as compared to first generation medications. These characteristics make Duloxetine the most effective therapeutic choice to improve both psychological and somatic symptoms of depression in order to get higher rates of symptomatic remission on depressive episodes.

The gradual deterioration of function with increasing age is so widely perceived and so expected that all deterioration in function in an elderly person tends to be attributed to age. Disease in younger adults usually produces characteristic symptoms and signs by which a particular disease is recognised; if a diagnosis is not achieved on initial contact with the patient, the symptoms and signs are used as a base for further investigations and action. Functional disability due to disease attracts little medical interest, which is concentrated upon the specific features of the disease; thus the referral letter about a younger patient with suspected myocardial infarction is likely to discuss the features of the chest pain, but is unlikely to mention whether the patient can walk to the toilet or feed himself.",

It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "abstract": "Stress is the body's response to any changes that might place it under mental, emotional, or physical strain and could either demand attention or prompt action. A stress reaction can be brought on by both internal and external factors. The conditions, demands, issues, and expectations you deal with every day are all regarded as external influences, as are your physical surroundings, your job, your contacts with others, your family, and all other related factors. The ability of your body to respond to and handle external stimuli depends on internal factors. Your ability to handle stress is influenced internally by your food habits, level of general health and fitness, mental health, and the amount of sleep and rest you get. Such demanding conditions could affect how certain stress hormone levels are regulated. Biomarkers such as mGlu2/3, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), serum alpha-amylase, amygdala reactivity, neuropeptide Y (NPY), heat shock proteins, cortisol, and catecholamines are used to assess the hormone imbalance. Disease prevention, early detection, and therapy are all possible uses for biomarkers. In this review, we looked at a wide range of stress-related biomarkers that might cause different psychiatric illnesses and how those conditions can, over time, alter a person's lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Concussion is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute, but generally transient, neurologic impairment due to biomechanical forces imparted to the brain. The most commonly reported symptom is headache, although cognitive impairment, amnesia, disequilibrium, sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes are frequently reported as well. By definition, these neurologic symptoms and signs should recover with time; however, there is growing concern for irreversible cumulative effects of repeat concussions. This raises the clinical question that we will address in this chapter—how many concussions are too many before an athlete should retire? Three clinical presentations that should prompt the treating clinician to recommend retirement from contact sports include the following: (1) diagnosis of a neurodegenerative condition, (2) permanent or persistent cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment, and (3) intractable pain and headache (Table 22-1). A relative indication to consider retirement would be progressively lower threshold for concussion with worse symptoms. We will address the evidence that supports these conclusions. Table 22-1 Four Clinical Presentations That Should Prompt Recommendations for Retirement From Contact Sports Strongly recommend retirement if there is: Diagnosis of a neurodegenerative condition Permanent or persistent cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment Intractable pain and headache Consider recommending retirement if there is: Progressively lower threshold for concussion or progressively more severe symptoms",

      "abstract": "The modern concept of stress is based on responses to events or factors (\"stressors\") experienced as aversive, threatening or excessive for maintaining physiological equilibrium of an organism. Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor.

Often delirium is due to multiple simultaneous causes, each one of which may or may not be enough to cause delirium by itself. We report a case of delirium accompanied by ataxia, depression and psychotic symptoms in a 72 year-old man with atrial fibrillation and intermittent trifascicular block. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigation allows underlying causes to be detected and treated. Clinical experience requires, therefore, to think of the crisis with a view to the difficult effort of composition and synthesis of a plurality of factors of various kinds (biological, psychological, and interpersonal).

      "abstract": "The heterogeneity of clinical syndromes subsumed by diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) is regarded by some as a reason to abandon or modify the criteria. However, heterogeneity may be unavoidable because of the biopsychosocial complexity of depression. MDD may be characterised by complexities that cannot be distilled down to any brief set of diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists and psychiatric epidemiologists may need to revise their expectations of this diagnosis in order to avoid over-estimating its ability to guide the selection of treatments and prediction of prognosis. An opposing perspective is that of reification, in which the diagnosis is viewed as being more real than it really is. The concept of rheostasis may help to explain some features of this condition, such as why major depressive episodes sometimes seem understandable or even adaptive (e.g. in the context of bereavement) whereas at other times such episodes are inexplicable and maladaptive.",

      "abstract": "Shame is a complex emotional state, a universal experience, whose influence can be extensive. Elusive by its nature, shame can escape the attention of specialists. Discussions on shame as a separate and distinct emotion are rare, most often being denied, hidden or concealed by more socially acceptable emotions. Offspring of a disappointed Ideal Self, shame reflects on Self Respect and Self Image, both important and influential components of the psyche, with major implications in personality. Being a strong negative emotion, shame can have an important and quite extensive influence on mental health through its numerous somatic correlates intensely and widely expressed at different organic level on somatovisceral activity – thus, resulting in the appearance of numerous disorders and psychosomatic diseases – among them obesity, which was chosen by the author as the subject of a future research.",

      "title": "Four Faces of Baroreflex Failure",
      "abstract": "The baroreflex normally serves to buffer blood pressure against excessive rise or fall. Baroreflex failure occurs when afferent baroreceptive nerves or their central connections become impaired. In baroreflex failure, there is loss of buffering ability, and wide excursions of pressure and heart rate occur. Such excursions may derive from endogenous factors such as stress or drowsiness, which result in quite high and quite low pressures, respectively. They may also derive from exogenous factors such as drugs or environmental influences.Impairment of the baroreflex may produce an unusually broad spectrum of clinical presentations; with acute baroreflex failure, a hypertensive crisis is the most common presentation. Over succeeding days to weeks, or in the absence of an acute event, volatile hypertension with periods of hypotension occurs and may continue for many years, usually with some attenuation of pressor surges and greater prominence of depressor valleys during long-term follow-up. With incomplete loss of baroreflex afferents, a mild syndrome of orthostatic tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance may appear. Finally, if the baroreflex failure occurs without concomitant destruction of the parasympathetic efferent vagal fibers, a resting state may lead to malignant vagotonia with severe bradycardia and hypotension and episodes of sinus arrest.Although baroreflex failure is not the most common cause of the above conditions, correct differentiation from other cardiovascular disorders is important, because therapy of baroreflex failure requires specific strategies, which may lead to successful control.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Public awareness and acknowledgment of depressions and other affective states have increased during the 1970s, and growing numbers of persons with depressive symptoms are seeking medical attention. Epidemiologic studies show that perhaps 15% to 30% of all adults experience depressive symptoms at some time during their lives. Depressions occur about twice as frequently among women as among men and often occur during the highly productive years of young adulthood. The term \"depression\" refers to a mood state, a symptom, or a group of clinical syndromes. Feelings of sadness, disappointment, and frustration are a normal component of the human condition. However, when the sadness interferes with normal functioning, medical intervention may be helpful. Dysphorias may be due to concurrent medical, social, or other psychiatric problems.

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.). Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety.

A disproportionate amount of the enormous personal, societal, and economic toll is attributable to recurrent depression, wherein individuals suffer episodes repeatedly throughout their lives. At present, no clinical or scientific evidence can predict who will develop the disorder on an individual basis. We suggest two explanations for this pivotal prognostic impasse. First, a widespread belief that major depression is primarily a highly recurrent disorder is incorrect and misleading. Second, this incorrect belief has biased concepts, definitions, and research practices, further reinforcing the idea that depression usually is highly recurrent. We explain how such a belief and associated research practices stand in the way of progress, and we outline an agenda for discovering who is at greatest risk for recurrences following depression’s first onset.",

      "title": "The Classification and Assessment of Intellectual and Other Psychological Impairments in the Mentally Disabled",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric rehabilitation of the chronically mentally ill requires conceptual distinction among psychological abnormalities of the nervous system, representing active pathology or a disease state; impairment of functions by means of which those abnormalities can be inferred; disabilities, i.e., losses of functional ability consequent upon an impairment; and handicaps, which are the social disadvantages resulting from disability [1-3]. These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled. Patients with schizophrenia are especially subject to",

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

      "title": "Recognizing Mimics of Depression: The '8 Ds': This Mnemonic Helps Recall Conditions That May Make Medically Ill Patients Appear Depressed",
      "abstract": "Many psychiatric and medical illnesses as well as normal reactions to stressors have symptoms that overlap with those of depressive disorders, including outwardly sad or dysphoric appearance, irritability, apathy or amotivation, fatigue, difficulty making decisions, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbances. This cluster of symptoms forms a readily observable behavioral phenotype that clinicians may label as before considering a broader differential diagnosis. To better understand what other conditions belong in the differential diagnosis, we reviewed a sample of 100 consecutive medical/ surgical inpatients referred to our consultationliaison psychiatry practice for evaluation of Ultimately, only 29 of these patients received a diagnosis. Many of the other diagnoses given in our sample required attention during inpatient medical or surgical care because they were potentially life-threatening if left unaddressed--such as delirium--or they interfered with managing the primary medical or surgical condition for which the patient was hospitalized. Hurried or uncertain primary care clinicians frequently use depression as a catch-all term when requesting psychiatric consultation for patients who seem depressed. A wide range of conditions can mimic depression, and the art of psychosomatic psychiatry includes considering protean possibilities when assessing a patient. We identified 7 diagnoses that mimic major and developed our 8 D differential to help clinicians properly diagnose depressed patients who have something other than a depressive disorder. Although our sample consisted of hospitalized patients, these mimics of may be found among patients referred from other clinical settings for evaluation of possible depression. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] The perils of misdiagnosis Depression is common among patients hospitalized with medical or surgical conditions. DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) include the presence of low mood and/or anhedonia, plus [greater than or equal to]4 other depressive symptoms for[greater than or equal to]2 weeks. (1) Growing evidence suggests that the relationship between and morbidity and mortality in medical illness is bidirectional, and nonpsychiatrists are becoming increasingly aware of major depression's serious impact on their patients' physical health. (2-5) Although improving nonpsychiatrists' recognition of in medically ill patients is laudable, it comes with a high falsepositive rate. In a study of primary care outpatients, Berardi et al found that 45% of patients labeled depressed did not meet ICD-10 criteria for major depression, but >25% of those patients were prescribed an antidepressant.6 In a large retrospective study, Boland et al found that approximately 40% of patients referred to an inpatient psychiatric consultation service for did not meet criteria for a depressive illness, and primary medical services often confused organic syndromes such as delirium and dementia with depression.' Similarly, Clarke et al found that 26% of medical and surgical inpatients referred to psychiatry with depression had another diagnosis commonly delirium that better accounted for their symptoms. (8) What is the harm in overdiagnosing depression? Missing a serious or lifethreatening diagnosis is a primary concern. For example, unrecognized delirium, which frequently was misdiagnosed as in the Berardi, (6) Boland (7) and Clarke (8) studies, is associated with myriad difficulties, including higher morbidity and mortality. (9) Substance use disorders, which also commonly masquerade as depression, frequently are comorbid with medical illness. Delays in appropriate treatment of withdrawal syndromes particularly of alcohol and sedative/hypnotic medications--are risk factors for increased mortality in these illnesses. …",

Leitsymptome des psychiatrischen Notfalls sind Störungen des Bewusstseins, des Antriebs und der Stimmung. Ein psychiatrischer Notfall erfordert zum Ausschluss einer exogenen Ursache oder organischer Erkrankung neben der Erhebung eines differenzierten psychopathologischen Befundes obligatorisch eine körperliche Untersuchung und den Einsatz apparativer Untersuchungen. Psychiatrische Notfälle sind nach internistischen Notfällen die zweit- bis dritthäufigste Einsatzursache für einen Notarzt. Psychiatrische Störungen werden in Notaufnahmen nur zum geringen Teil erkannt und angemessen versorgt. Selbst bei gesicherter Suchtmitteleinnahme sollte nach weiteren Ursachen für die Symptomatik und nach begleitenden Verletzungen gesucht werden, damit Differenzialdiagnosen nicht übersehen werden. Für Erregungszustände und sich ankündigende Aggressivität gibt es charakteristische Prodromalsymptome. Sie können jedoch auch unvermutet und völlig unverhältnismäßig auftreten (Raptus). Über 10 % der Ärzte erleiden im Laufe ihres Berufslebens Verletzungen als Folge von Aggressivität durch Patienten. Bei Lebensbedrohung, blindwütigem Rasen oder im Erregungssturm ist das entschiedene, unmissverständliche und koordinierte Vorgehen von medizinischem Personal, Ordnungs- und Rettungskräften zur Verhinderung von Personenschäden aus zahlenmäßig hoher Überlegenheit unumgänglich. Mit der Durchführung eines Suizidversuchs ist Suizidalität in der Regel nicht erloschen. Eine Krisenintervention ist auf die unmittelbare Stabilisierung des Patienten ausgerichtet. Eine Krise wird in den seltensten Fällen durch die Krisenintervention gelöst. Die Kombination von Antipsychotika und Benzodiazepinen ist bei schweren Unruhe- und Erregungszuständen am effektivsten. Eine rasche Besserung bei ängstlichen Depressionen oder quälender innerer Unruhe kann durch Benzodiazepine (z. B. Lorazepam) erfolgen.

      "abstract": "Burnout has been viewed as a syndrome developing in response to chronically adverse working conditions. Burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Historically, however, burnout has been difficult to separate from depression. Indeed, the symptoms of burnout coincide with symptoms of depression. Evidence for the discriminant validity of burnout with regard to depression has been weak, both at an empirical and a theoretical level. Emotional exhaustion, the core of burnout, itself reflects a combination of depressed mood and fatigue/loss of energy and correlates very highly with other depressive symptoms. Work-related risk factors for burnout are also predictors of depression. Individual risk factors for depression (e.g., past depressive episodes) are also predictors of burnout. Overall, burnout is likely to reflect a \"classical\" depressive process unfolding in reaction to unresolvable stress.",

Excessive and persistent fear, anxiety, and related behavioral disturbances are the hallmark features of anxiety disorders. The high comorbidity of these disorders with each other and with other physical illness, such as cardiovascular disease, suggest that depressive and anxiety disorders have more similarities than differences. Besides shared genetic vulnerability, depressive and anxiety disorders both have close ties to stress. Stress-related pathology, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and elevated proinflammatory activity, is frequently observed in people with depressive or anxiety disorders. Besides standard pharmacological treatment, people with depressive and anxiety disorders respond positively to biobehavioral interventions, especially cognitive behavioral therapy.

      "title": "Approach to fatigue in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Lim, a 56-year-old housewife, comes into your consultation room for complaints of fatigue over the past 1 month. She reports unrefreshing sleep and has been drinking 3-4 cups of coffee and taking 1-hour afternoon naps to keep her going throughout the day. During the consultation, you find out that she has recently stopped working to care for her elderly mother-in-law who has been recently diagnosed with dementia.WHAT IS FATIGUE? Fatigue can be defined as a state of physical or mental exhaustion with difficulty or inability to initiate or maintain activity.[1] It can compromise on a person's mental alertness, physical motor skills, judgement and decision-making. Simply put, fatigue has been generally been described by patients as feeling tired or exhausted. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? Fatigue is a common symptom presenting in general practice, which can negatively affect patients' work performance and family and social relationships. It often poses as a diagnostic challenge with a variety of differential diagnoses, due to its associations with biophysical, psychological and social problems. International surveys have shown that 1 in 4 family medicine patients present with fatigue, with fatigue being the main reason for encounter in 6.5% and a secondary reason in 19%.[2] It is also prevalent in the young adults and paediatric population, with 1 in 3 adolescents reporting fatigue at least four times a week.[3] WHAT CAUSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED? Fatigue can be classified according to time frame (acute, subacute, chronic) or aetiology (physiologic, secondary). Acute fatigue lasts for one month or less, subacute fatigue lasts between one and six months, while chronic fatigue lasts more than six months.[4] Secondary fatigue is due to an underlying medical condition, while physiologic fatigue is caused by a lifestyle imbalance in routines of sleep, exercise, diet or other activity not attributed to an underlying medical condition and is alleviated by rest.[5] There are a multitude of causes for fatigue [Box 1]. Murtagh describes a practical diagnostic approach by classifying the causes of fatigue into probability diagnoses, serious disorders not to be missed and pitfalls.[6] Probability diagnoses include anxiety/stress, depression, viral/post-viral infections and sleep-related disorders. Serious disorders to be considered include anaemia, malignancy, and infective causes such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B/C, bacterial infections. Common pitfalls that are often missed include depression, medication and substance use, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus and incipient cardiac failure.Box 1: Causes of fatigue. (Adapted from Murtagh)[6]Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a complex syndrome causing profound unexplained fatigue and is an illness of uncertain aetiology. It is estimated to affect 17 to 24 million people worldwide, approximately 1% of the population.[7] CFS is a debilitating condition that is associated with a poorer quality of life, with over half of CFS patients being unemployed.[7] The diagnostic criteria of CFS are outlined in Box 2 and requires careful exclusion of alternative diagnoses by clinical history, examination and investigations as appropriate.Box 2: Criteria for the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. (Adapted from Murtagh)[6]WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? International studies have demonstrated a wide variation in rates of formal diagnoses of organic pathology (e.g. thyroid disease, anaemia), ranging from as low as 8.2% to 50% in patients presenting with fatigue.[8910] This discrepancy in findings may possibly be due to different ways of classifying organic or somatic diagnoses. Thus, despite being associated with various medical and psychological causes, fatigue remains unexplained in majority of cases, with the final diagnosis being \"tiredness\". General approach In local primary care settings where time may be limited, it is recommended to schedule repeated appointments to explore and manage patients' symptoms, as well as patients' ideas, concerns and expectations. The first visit should aim to elucidate the underlying cause of fatigue using a biopsychosocial approach. Initiating the consultation with open-ended questions would help to narrow down the most likely differential diagnoses. An assessment of severity can be done by evaluating how fatigue has impaired the patient's function and quality of life. It is recommended to allocate more time in the initial follow-up appointment to discuss the outcome of the investigations, further narrow down the differentials with more history-taking, and work towards a shared action plan with the patient. Subsequently, shorter appointments can be arranged to target specific action areas, such as sleep hygiene, stress management and relaxation techniques, and structured problem-solving. Initial evaluation Clinical evaluation of fatigue should begin with identifying the common causes, red flags and masquerades. A comprehensive history, by no means exhaustive, may include clarification on patient's ideas/concerns/expectations on fatigue, onset/duration/severity and impact on function, associated somatic and psychological symptoms, alcohol, drug and medication history [Box 3], sleep patterns and hygiene, and social history including occupation (e.g. shift work). Red flags, which may point towards serious underlying pathology, include constitutional symptoms (unintentional loss of weight, loss of appetite, fever), recent onset in a previously well older patient, unexplained lymphadenopathy and abnormal bleeding. Similarly, physical examination findings that raise suspicion of underlying somatic diseases include pallor (anaemia, malignancy), lymphadenopathy (malignancy), goitre (thyroid disorder), murmurs (endocarditis) and oedema (cardiac failure, liver disease).Box 3: Medications and substances that can cause fatigue.Investigations In the climate of litigation fears as well as a lack of local guidelines for the evaluation of fatigue, general practitioners are often tempted to order an array of investigations. Investigations commonly ordered in the evaluation of fatigue include full blood count, electrolyte panel, thyroid hormone panel, renal function test, liver function test, blood glucose, urinalysis, inflammatory markers, and urine pregnancy test in females of child-bearing age. However, studies have demonstrated that there is limited positive predictive value of blood tests, as fatigue is associated with a low pre-test probability of underlying organic pathology, with results affecting management in only 5% of patients.[1112] Given the low yield of investigations in elucidating an underlying cause for fatigue and the implications of false-positive results, it is reasonable to adopt an approach of watchful waiting in the absence of red flags and symptoms that point towards underlying pathology. Once the decision has been made to investigate, judicious selection of tests should be employed. Follow-up Based on the history and examination findings, targeted first-line screening investigations as presented earlier (e.g. full blood count, electrolytes and renal function, blood glucose, thyroid function, inflammatory markers) can be considered. Secondary causes of fatigue that are detected should then be managed accordingly. In the absence of pathology, a common misunderstanding is that if patients do not return, it indicates fatigue resolution. However, on the contrary, patients' fatigue may still be present, but they may feel that nothing can be done due to a lack of understanding of their fatigue and lack of an identified cause. Scheduling an early appointment for review of symptoms, rather than sporadic walk-in encounters is thus recommended to monitor patients' response to management plans. In patients with an identified cause of fatigue, if management of the underlying condition does not lead to resolution or improvement, further re-evaluation for alternative causes would be warranted. During these visits, consider equipping patients with helpful information, including symptom management, setting stepwise realistic goals, and coming to a shared understanding and identification of triggers such as lifestyle, social and environmental factors. Patients should be observed and re-evaluated at these visits to assess if treatment is effective or if reassessment is required. Management Management of fatigue involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies. Non-pharmacological Exercise therapy and sleep hygiene advice [Box 4] have been shown to improve fatigue regardless of aetiology and should be recommended to all patients with fatigue.[13] Cognitive behavioural therapy has also shown good response in patients with CFS.[14] Management strategies in CFS include validating that CFS is a real illness, patient education and reassurance that CFS is usually self-limiting with most patients returning to normal health, and providing continued support and counselling.[6]Box 4: Non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue.It should be standard practice to advise patients to maintain good sleep hygiene, keep a symptom and sleep diary for self-management, and to engage in physical activity that involves stretching and aerobic exercise like walking. Basic cognitive behavioural therapy strategies that primary care physicians can employ in their practice are highlighted in Box 5. Local resources, including psychologists, are often available in most polyclinic settings, and can provide cognitive behavioural therapy, problem-solving therapy, relaxation skills training and mindfulness-based interventions. To empower patients in self-management, physicians can also recommend self-help resources such as the \"Headspace\" and \"Calm\" meditation applications, local websites like \"mindline.sg\", \"HealthHub\" and the \"Understanding Your Mental Health\" section on the Institute of Mental Health website which often feature articles on mental wellness tips, and hotlines such as \"Samaritans of Singapore\" at 1800-221 4444 for 24-hour emotional support.Box 5: Cognitive behavioural therapy strategies.Pharmacological In patients whom depression is suspected in the absence of organic pathology, a six-week trial of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline) may be considered.[5] A common pitfall is over-reliance on hypnotic medications such as antihistamines (e.g. hydroxyzine) to help with sleep. Primary care physicians should educate patients that fatigue is a symptom that can be managed non-pharmacologically, with pharmacotherapy being prescribed only when non-pharmacological interventions are deemed ineffective. WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Primary care physicians should consider referral to a specialist if there are secondary organic causes of fatigue to be managed at the specialist level. Timely psychiatric referral should also be considered in patients with psychiatric conditions that cannot be managed in the primary care setting such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and substance use disorder. Failure of treatment of depression, anxiety or somatisation disorders at the primary care level should also prompt a referral to psychiatry. Referral to allied healthcare professionals, such as psychologists, should also be considered for patients who may benefit from specialised interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy). A multidisciplinary approach is recommended in managing chronic fatigue syndrome, to provide psychological support and focused treatment on comorbid symptoms such as insomnia, mood disorders, pain, memory and concentration difficulties. TAKE HOME MESSAGES Fatigue is a common non-specific symptom presenting in primary care, associated with a wide range of underlying aetiologies. These include acute and chronic medical conditions, psychiatric conditions, medication/substance use, and physiologic fatigue. Initial evaluation should be focused on identifying and managing common and life-threatening secondary causes. Laboratory tests often have a low yield in leading to a formal clinical diagnosis in patients with fatigue. Thus, it is reasonable to utilise a practical approach of taking a comprehensive history and examination, consider watchful waiting in the absence of red flags, and judicious selection of tests once one has made the choice to investigate. In the absence of organic causes, consider a six-week trial of SSRIs in patients with fatigue in whom depression is suspected. Exercise therapy and sleep hygiene advice should be recommended to all patients with fatigue, regardless of aetiology. Cognitive behavioural therapy can also be considered to manage fatigue symptoms for conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome. Closing Vignette A comprehensive history and examination reveals no significant red flags. Mrs Lim shares that her mood is stable and is coping well with support from her husband and friends. You discuss appropriate sleep hygiene practices, counsel on relaxation techniques and provide psychological support for caregiver stress. You advise her to return earlier if new symptoms or red flags arise. Mrs Lim agrees to the treatment plan and a review in two weeks' time.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is the second most commonly diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and the physical manifestations of the disease are well documented in the literature. However, in excess of 60% of patients with the disease report having one or more psychiatric symptoms which worsen as the disease progresses. These symptoms arise differentially from the same pathology which underlies the disease or from the treatment with dopaminergic drugs. Psychiatric and psychological difficulties tend to be under-recognised and undertreated yet cause great disability, significantly impact the quality of life of patients and add to greater burden on their caregivers. These symptoms can be relieved through adjusting the doses of anti-Parkinson’s drug therapy and success in improving psychological distress has been found using adjuvant psychotherapeutic intervention, most notably with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.",

      "abstract": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is one of the main causes of neurodegenerative dementias in adults. Patients present with an early decline in social conduct, impaired regulation of interpersonal conduct, apathy, emotional blunting, and general loss of insight. However, symptoms are highly variable among patients, leading to misdiagnosis or diagnosis delay in particular when psychiatric symptoms are prominent at the onset of the disease. More specifically, personality disorders have been described as either a risk factor for misdiagnosis or as part of the bvFTD phenotype.\r\n\r\nHere we report the case of a 52-year-old woman, born from consanguineous parents and with a family history of early-onset dementia, who was first diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Nonetheless, atypical symptoms such as apathy, disinhibition, hyperorality, depressive symptoms and psychotic manifestations were described.The clinical exam revealed a frontal lobe dysfunction, along with severe cognitive impairment as revealed by the neuropsychological assessment (alteration of facial emotion recognition and theory of mind, with a relative sparing of executive and instrumental functions). Brain imaging revealed atrophy of frontal lobes and right hemisphere, and a hypometabolism of the right frontotemporal lobe.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the clinical presentation and her family history, screening for hereditary diseases was performed, revealing a heterozygous mutation of PGRN gene. The diagnosis of bvFTD with progranulin mutation was finally made. This case highlights for the first time a diagnosis of bvFTD associated with a progranulin mutation and a history of late-labeled histrionic personality disorder. It emphasizes the need to actively seek frontal symptoms and consider PGRN mutation in late-labelled patients with personality disorders with a family history of neurodegenerative disorders.",

There are vital differences not only as to etiology (Cobb<sup>1</sup>) but also as to the manner in which the illness sets in, its evolution and its clinical manifestations. In fully developed epilepsy the attacks usually show an assortment of features, including psychic, visceral and motor symptoms. In this study we directed attention to the mode of onset and noted that the illness commonly began in one of two ways. In some patients epilepsy set in abruptly; a person previously well fell to the ground in a sudden, violent convulsion. In other patients the disease set in gradually, beginning with slight, peculiar sensations, which recurred with added features until, in the course of months or years, true epileptic characteristics became evident. The first type may be considered as abrupt or violent; the second may be designated",

Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy. Yet, epidemiological data suggest that depression is the most prevalent disorders among all psychiatric illness in epilepsy. Likewise, several emerging data have explored several multifactorial etiologies of depression in epilepsy. These include underlying genetic, neurochemical, anatomical, neurologic, and iatrogenic factors. Furthermore, clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with QOL than does seizure rates. Unfortunately, however, a significant proportion of patients with epilepsy and depression are not diagnosed nor offered the appropriate treatment. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of SSRI, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management is expected to become available in the near future.",

      "title": "The Contribution of Demoralization to End of Life Decisionmaking",
      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists believe that syndrome is a diagnosable cognitive disorder characterized in its extreme form by morbid existential distress. If they are right, then it should be an important part of our thinking about end of life decisionmaking. A demoralized patient would be unable to think reliably about the remainder of her life, and therefore incompetent to decide to commit physician-assisted suicide. The pointlessness of a wretched existence, in which meaning and purpose are lost and despair is pervasive, can lead to a wish to die. This mental state may develop in association with the suffering of the chronically medically ill and of the dying. Should a plea to hasten dying be viewed as a rational request for merciful assistance, or is it symptomatic of a suicidal mind disordered through illness and warranting a therapeutic response? Out of the clinical and ethical debates about end of life decisionmaking, a fundamental question has arisen: is demoralization no more than a comprehensible human and emotional response to a state of dire bodily disease, or can it be a pathological process deserving of diagnosis as illness? In this paper, I explore demoralization as a dimensional state of mind--that is, as a mental state ranging from a normal response to perceived helplessness to a morbid form of existential distress. The impact of demoralization upon a person's capacity to give informed consent across a range of end-of-life decisions is a pivotal question. Demoralization influences a person's assumptive world and may, as I shall show, interfere with his appreciation of clinical data pertinent to decisionmaking. Clinical and legislative implications arise when severe demoralization is recognized as a morbid state of mind. Acceptance of Dying No argument exists concerning the capacity of people to accept rationally the reality of their death. Indeed, sociologists have described this as a quest of the modern palliative care movement: to help patients face their dying with open awareness and courage, the 'ideal' of a heroic death in the supportive care of their family, friends, and community. (1) This acceptance of dying is commonly identifiable within the narrative of many patients, especially the very elderly, as they anticipate what their future might hold. The following clinical account helps to illustrate their mental state. Giuseppe, a married, seventy-five-year-old Italian, suffering from lung cancer and recurrent chest infections, caused his oncologist concern when he expressed a wish to die. He appeared very sad as he spoke of his limited future, his frustration at a considerably restricted exercise tolerance, and the boredom that set in at home. He was the youngest of three children born to a farming family in Northern Italy, his education cut short by the onset of World War II when he was just fourteen. After serving in the army, Giuseppe traveled to France where he married and fathered two daughters. In the 1960s, the family migrated to Australia, where Giuseppe worked as a leading hand in the building industry until retirement a decade ago. He was proud of the respect he had earned for his contribution to the workplace, and especially of his family--the very best! He delighted in completing the crossword puzzle daily. While volunteering an acceptance of his diagnosis, he described waves of sadness that came over him when he thought about his life ending. Yet when conversing more generally, he was interactive, spontaneous, could share a joke, and his mood was dearly reactive to the environmental context. His interest in sport and classical movies sustained his enjoyment of life. There was no hint of a clinical depression. Acknowledging that his health was considerably compromised, he explained that he did not want to go on living with illness. He stated, My chest is no good at all. I don't know about my future. …",

      "title": "Transcultural Aspects of Somatic Symptoms in the Context of Depressive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms are a common presentation of mental disorders or psychological distress worldwide, and may often coexist with depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus accounting for what might be the most frequent psychiatric syndrome in primary care. Indeed, physical symptoms accompanying the clinical presentations of a variety of mental disorders may be considered as universal 'idioms of distress' that may vary across cultures, depending on attitudes and explanations embedded in each one of them. These variations in symptom presentations are the result of various interacting factors that ultimately determine how individuals identify and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness, and seek medical attention. This chapter examines the impact of culture on the experiencing of somatic symptoms, based on an inclusive review of the topic from ethnic, nosological, clinical and social perspectives. Particular attention is paid to the association of somatic symptoms with mood symptoms, since depressive disorders appear to be the most common, costly and disabling psychiatric entities worldwide. The review shows that racial/ethnic variations in somatic symptoms in the context of depression are common, and seem to be related to depression severity. Sociocultural factors, particularly stigma, may influence the unique emphasis placed on somatic symptoms within depression, and may account for some racial/ethnic differences in somatic symptom reporting.",

      "abstract": "The term 'Borderline Personality Disorder' (BPD) refers to a psychiatric syndrome that is characterized by emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, risk-taking behavior, irritability, feelings of emptiness, self-injury and fear of abandonment, as well as unstable interpersonal relationships. BPD is not only common in psychiatric populations but also more prevalent in the general community than previously thought, and thus represents an important public health issue. In contrast to most psychiatric disorders, some symptoms associated with BPD may improve over time, even without therapy, though impaired social functioning and interpersonal disturbances in close relationships often persist. Another counterintuitive and insufficiently resolved question is why depressive symptoms and risk-taking behaviors can occur simultaneously in the same individual. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate about the nosological position of BPD, which impacts on research regarding sex differences in clinical presentation and patterns of comorbidity. In this review, it is argued that many features of BPD may be conceptualized within an evolutionary framework, namely behavioral ecology. According to Life History Theory, BPD reflects a pathological extreme or distortion of a behavioral 'strategy' which unconsciously aims at immediate exploitation of resources, both interpersonal and material, based on predictions shaped by early developmental experiences. Such a view is consistent with standard medical conceptualizations of BPD, but goes beyond classic 'deficit'-oriented models, which may have profound implications for therapeutic approaches.",

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

      "abstract": "We describe a case of a patient with a functional coma ,and give a systemic review of literature. Functional coma is an extremely rare disorder with only 21 described cases in the literature. The disease is linked to a conversion disorder or a dissociative disorder and is predominantly found in females. Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system. The most important differential diagnosis are catatonia, factitious disorder, and malingering. Spontaneous recovery can be expected after a duration of about 45 minutes to 4 days.",

This finding has been replicated in studies across the globe, even though the prevalence of MDD varies greatly internationally. The greater the number of physical symptoms, the more likely the patient is to have a mood disorder, but the presence of pain or physical symptoms negatively impacts physicians' ability to recognize MDD. To improve the recognition of MDD and ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment, clinicians should perform a differential diagnosis that includes psychiatric disorders when patients present with chronic pain or other somatic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a major problem in medical patients. It is a problem that has been generally under-recognized and under-treated, highly associated with somatized symptoms, loss of function, and increased medical utilization. Obviously more training needs to be provided in this area for non-psychiatric physicians, as well as other primary care providers. Much of what guides recognition and treatment of depression in medical patients has been derived from studies of depression in non-medical populations. However, it is not completely clear that depression in medical populations is the same problem as that seen in the mental health care setting. Furthermore, the majority of psychopharmacology studies have been done in patients with no medical conditions. There are, fortunately, increasing numbers of drug and ECT studies in specific medical populations as well as outcome studies in medically ill depressed patients. There has been increasing recognition that in the primary care setting, less severe depressive symptom constellations are a common problem. This so-called \"sub-syndromal\" depression is an area of great interest but little understanding. There is no well researched information on such depressions in terms of natural course, response to treatment, or relation to other disorders such as anxiety disorders. It is hoped that non-psychiatric physicians will increasingly recognize depression in their patients and feel comfortable in its evaluation and initial management. Clinical practice guidelines, which may be helpful to primary care physicians, are currently being developed. When patients seem difficult to manage or diagnose, consultation should be sought from psychiatrists familiar with the special presentations and problems of working with this population.",

      "title": "From stress to inflammation and major depressive disorder: A social signal transduction theory of depression.",
      "abstract": "Major life stressors, especially those involving interpersonal stress and social rejection, are among the strongest proximal risk factors for depression. In this review, we propose a biologically plausible, multilevel theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental stress with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis. Central to this social signal transduction theory of depression is the hypothesis that experiences of social threat and adversity up-regulate components of the immune system involved in inflammation. The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. This highly conserved biological response to adversity is critical for survival during times of actual physical threat or injury. However, this response can also be activated by modern-day social, symbolic, or imagined threats, leading to an increasingly proinflammatory phenotype that may be a key phenomenon driving depression pathogenesis and recurrence, as well as the overlap of depression with several somatic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegeneration. Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions. This work may also suggest new opportunities for preventing and treating depression by targeting inflammation.",

      "abstract": "The relationship of psychosocial factors to heart disease has been a subject of intellectual and practical interest in medicine for hundreds of years. A psychosocial factor may be defined as a measurement that potentially relates psychological phenomena to the social environment and to pathophysiological changes. In healthy populations, prospective cohort studies show a possible etiological role for type A/hostility , depression and anxiety , social support psychosocial work characteristics. Psychosocial factors may act alone or combine in clusters. Hostility, a major attribute of the type A behavior pattern, has received considerable attention as a potential toxic element in this personality construct. An accumulating body of evidence also suggests multiple pathophysiological mechanisms by which hostility may be linked to coronary artery disease. Also, evidence suggests that hostile individuals are more likely to exhibit hypercortisolemia and high levels of circulating catecholamines Cardiovascular disease frequently coexists with psychiatric disorders - depression and anxiety. Depressed individuals are more likely to develop angina, or fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, than their non-depressed counterparts. Depression is associated with abnormalities of platelet function, blood coagulation, immune function, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, autonomic balance, folate/homocysteine metabolism, and endothelial function, all of which may play a role in the atherosclerotic disease process. The association between anxiety and sudden death, but not myocardial infarction, suggests that ventricular arrhythmias may be the mechanism for cardiac death among individuals with anxiety disorders. Like other psychosocial factors, social support influences the extent to which individuals engage in such high-risk behaviors as smoking, fatty diet intake, and excessive alcohol consumption. In addition, social factors may exert direct pathophysiological effects, including hypercortisolemia. and increase urinary levels of epinephrine. Exactly that social factors promote atherogenesis through activation of the autonomic nervous system. Chronic work related stress appears to exert direct pathophysiological effects, including elevation of arterial blood pressure and neurohumoral arousal. The reviewed evidence suggests that each of these risk factors is associated with specific pathophysiological characteristics. The assessment of various levels of psychosocial risk factors and their pathophysiological correlates may therefore help to improve the risk stratification of patients with cardiac disease and may guide the development of future intervention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Introduction:The medical residency has been receiving attention in specialized literature as a period during which newly-graduated physicians are subjected to excessive workload (with a minimum weekly journey of 60 hours); low confidence both in their qualifications and practical training; and adverse interpersonal relations and rigid hierarchy involving their senior colleagues, professors and other professionals in their workplace.This situation exposes the junior physicians to psychosocial factors which, according to subjective perception and individual ways of coping, could lead to stress and psychic suffering, with negative repercussions upon the heath of those doctors and, consequently, of patients receiving care.In this period, residents face adverse situations more intensely than ever before during their training, which often hamper the seeking of personal satisfaction and professional fulfillment.On the other hand, it is known that coping mechanisms-i.e,strategies employed to keep mental health when confronted with different stressorscan evolve and adapt according to personal or collective experiences.When coping is not effective, impaired mental health may manifest as mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety; and as symptoms of chronic work-related stress disorders, the so-called Burnout Syndrome.Objetives: The present study aims at identifying the psychosocial factors in the medical residency; the ways of coping employed by residents; and, as a measure of a negative outcome, the Burnout syndrome among medical residents of a public medical college. Subjects and Method: Cross-section research with regularly enrolled medical residents in a university hospital in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, conducted between August and December, 2016.Residents were invited to fill out a series of selfresponse questionnaires, including a biosocial survey and validated instruments to identify ways of coping (Ways of Coping Questionnaire by Folkman and Lazarus) and Burnout syndrome (Maslach Burnout Inventory).Results: 33 (18.7%) of the medical residents completed the survey.It revealed excessive working hours as the psychosocial factor most frequently pointed out as stressogenic, being \"Solving Problems\" and \"Escape-avoidance\" the most used ways of coping.The registered prevalence of Burnout was 9.4% amongst the surveyed residents. Conclusion:Because of the central role of the medical training and career in the develpoment of physicians' identity, Medical Residents are particularly vulnerable to mental suffering derived from adverse conditions in the workplace.This study hopes to shed light on the subject in Brazil.More research is needed in Brazilian institutions to accurately define psychosocial factors impacting its medical residents' health and well-being, as well to draw strategies to reduce emotional suffering in these health professionals.",

Traditionally, this group includes depressive disorders, mania and submaniacal states, and anxiety disorders. A light form of depression is often unrecognized. The person feels chronic fatigue, weariness and discouragement to life. Depression caused by reactive factors is manifested by a smaller number of psychosomatic symptoms. According to the WHO (World Health Organization) report, by 2020 depression may become the second largest health risk after cardiovascular disease. The clinical picture of depression is dominated primarily by the depressed mood, which is felt by the patient as a state of gloom, resignation, and sadness. The patient is unable to experience joy, happiness and satisfaction. Anhedonia appears, or inability to feel any pleasures. A separate problem is the recognition of depression in the elderly age, when symptoms characteristic to depression are very often considered a normal manifestation of the body aging or as an inherent element of the somatic disease. Currently, it is estimated that as many as 40% of cases of depression in people over 65 remain undiagnosed.",

I think the question cannot yet be answered. However it is my hypothesis that in some personality structures the onset of CFS/ME following a physical illness exacerbates negativity and is an aspect of ordinary depression where there is a lowering of energy levels and a loss of zest for life, or it may reveal the pathological aspect of unresolved rage. Depending on the degree of pathological disturbance, working with and through the rage may or may not result in a resolution of the symptoms of ME. In this paper I consider some of the problems in the transference and countertransference relationship, which make it extremely difficult to separate out reality from phantasy. There is then the further problem of the denial of the psyche by the patient as part of the violence inherent in the illness. One case is presented, an example of ME in a borderline male patient in whom resolution could not be achieved.",

Although there is often dispute about whether the symptoms have a functional or organic basis, an informed approach to evaluation, diagnosis, and management and a careful assessment of impairment, disability, and work relatedness are necessary. Careful exclusion of organic causes, both toxicologic and nontoxicologic, is critical, followed by a judicious approach to coping with what at the end of practical evaluation seems to be mostly functional symptoms. Medical care is often best integrated from a psychosocial perspective.",

      "title": "Physical Activity, Stress Reactivity, and Stress-Mediated Pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "Patients with chronic pain are more likely to be sedentary and less likely to engage in regular physical activity or exercise than their healthy peers. Although individuals with chronic pain report many of the same obstacles to physical activity as healthy people, they also often attribute their lack of activity to disability or pain as a result of their condition and a fear of exacerbating symptoms. This perspective could be particularly detrimental for these individuals as their low levels of activity and large amounts of sedentary time put them at a greater risk for worsening their disability (McCracken & Samuel, 2007), as well as other medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This process has been characterized by some as a vicious cycle; these patients are inactive, at least in part, as a result of their pain condition, which leads to greater disability, which in turn decreases the likelihood of them being physically active (Leeuw et al., 2007). The relatively low level of activity in these patients is especially troubling when considering the large and growing body of evidence demonstrating that exercise and increased levels of daily physical activity can provide benefits to individuals with chronic pain beyond enhanced physical fitness. The benefits of regular exercise for these patients may include improvements in pain symptoms, physical and functional capacity, fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood, and quality of life. For low to moderate intensity prescriptions, the consensus appears to be that chronic pain patients can engage in exercise safely and without fear of exacerbating symptoms. Clinicians, for the most part, no longer subscribe to the view that rest and activity avoidance are the best methods of managing chronic pain symptoms. In fact, following decades of research, a recommendation for exercise or increased physical activity has become a standard element of multicomponent therapies for all manner of chronic pain conditions (Iversen, 2012).",

A burning mouth sensation can occur in several cutaneous or systemic diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome, since this term is used exclusively to refer to idiopathic forms and is included within the cutaneous sensory disorders. In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses. However, it is currently unclear whether psychologic factors are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome, or whether each exacerbates the other. Recent studies propose the etiology to be neurologic, either neuropathic or related to taste.",

Some of the issues that place people at a higher risk for developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) include: longer duration of the traumatic event; higher number of traumatic events; higher severity of the traumatic event, having little social support from family and friends. Also, children and adolescents, females, people with learning disabilities, or people who experience violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The websites of psychiatry organizations describe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as ranging from sleeplessness, nightmares to grief and depression – with accompanying physical signs such as headaches and irregular heartbeats. Such symptoms may gradually subside after a while; including chronic irritability, feelings of constantly being under threat, overeating, and alcohol abuse, perhaps dependency on tranquillizers or painkillers.",

      "abstract": "Many conditions in psychiatry cannot be separated from normality/healthy states (e.g. depression) but even these broad diagnostic constructs may include syndromes like melancholia. There is still a debate as to whether psychotic-like experiences in the community are on a continuum with psychotic symptoms in those meeting diagnostic criteria for psychosis diagnostic constructs. Schizophrenia may exist on a continuum with related conditions (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder). There are differences between people meeting criteria for schizophrenia and healthy controls but none that can be used as a diagnostic test to separate the two, with the possible exception of anomalous self-experiences differentiating schizophrenia spectrum conditions from healthy controls and other diagnostic constructs. Several general medical conditions also exist on a continuum with health with no zones of rarity (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes). Thresholds to meet criteria for these diagnostic constructs are chosen by expert committees often based on risk of developing complications (e.g. myocardial infarctions) and/or whether medical intervention may be beneficial. Even reasonably objective investigations can give abnormal results in healthy people. Concerns about whether thresholds are too low, leading to over-diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, and iatrogenic harm, also exist in general medicine. Other classifications in mental health will need to use thresholds in order to fulfil functions such as administration, research, or access to services. Dimensional classifications are good at representing the many spectrums of mental health.",

Back pain symptoms range from the simple backache, which most people have at some time in their lifetime, to serious spinal diseases and lower back disabilities. While back pain may have several causes, a large percentage of patients are diagnosed with nonspecific acute back pain with no proof of any major structural disease. As in many areas of malingering, objective diagnostic testing proving causation and supporting symptomatology is all but impossible. Notably, the history in the malingering patient may be either consistent or inconsistent. Physical examination findings to look for in a malingerer center on consistency of effort and compliance.",

Cases may go underdiagnosed, misdirected, or commonly treated inappropriately. Clinical studies have conclusively shown an obvious link between childhood trauma and the emergence of symptoms. Transient dissociative episodes are common and normative phenomena during childhood. We reported a case of an 8-year-old boy, who presented with a 5-day history of hallucinatory behavior. He was causing significant nuisances, sudden onset of shouting aggressively, and behavioral changes, associated with neuropsychiatric presentation such as repetitive irregular movement involving his head, neck, and upper limb. There was an asynchrony of symptoms exhibited which were unexplained by clinical semiology or patterns. He was screaming in fear, talking irrelevantly, and acting suspiciously. This was his first presentation to the hospital and no features to suggest organicity. There was no family history of mental illness. No substances, or alcohol and drug usage Serial investigation turned out to be normal and unremarkable. The episodes get frequent whenever parents or hospital staff give more attention toward him. He was given a low dose of antipsychotics, but no obvious rapid changes were observed afterward. Further exploration noted, his parents reported that the patient had been very worked up with past related trauma at school and constantly talking about it. He was afraid, distressed, and anxious as he felt something bad would happen to him. There were significant issues related to attachment figures in this boy, possibly the absent parenting style.

      "abstract": "Zimeldine, the first selective neuronal serotonin (5-H1) reuptake inhibitor to be registered as an antidepressant was withdrawn from common use due to an acute flu-like adverse syndrome comprising fever, myalgia and/or arthralgia and signs of disturbed liver function. A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

Sometimes they are the intended outcome of treatment, and in other cases they are an unintended side-effect. In all of these circumstances some patients and caregivers have described the psychological effects of DBS as frightening or disconcerting. I trace the source of these negative reactions to the fear that stimulation-related psychological and personality changes represent a threat to personal identity and agency. This issue has implications both for philosophical theories of personal identity and agency and for clinical concerns. A narrative account of personal identity is developed to illuminate the nature of the threat to identity and agency DBS potentially poses, and to suggest steps that might be taken to mitigate and avoid these threats.",

Both vestibular stimuli and vestibular dysfunction can underlie unreal experiences. Vestibular afferents provide a frame of reference (linear and angular head acceleration) within which spatial information from other senses is interpreted. This paper reviews evidence that symptoms of depersonalization/derealization associated with vestibular dysfunction are a consequence of a sensory mismatch between disordered vestibular input and other sensory signals of orientation.",

Furthermore, the etiology, or the more immediate origin of the symptomatology, is psychologic, while the expression is physiologic. The conduct, affects, attitudes and productions of these patients lead one to conclude that their psychologic functioning is unique in many important respects. Their subjective sense of values differs from that of the average person. Hence, their reactions are both qualitatively and quantitatively different.

      "abstract": "Based on his teaching experiences and clinical observations at Mental Health Centers, the author presents shortly the results of his clinical researches and will discuss on \"psychopathological effects of depression and anxiety on insomnia\" and very summarily on the treatment.The studies and lectures at the University Hospitals: Ir., IL, USA and France, especially during the last decades, have enriched this study research.The experiences and researches have clearly shown that depression and anxiety resulting from catastrophic life events, exert pathological effects not only on cognitive and cardiovascular system but have also psychopathological effects on internal organs such as pineal gland with its melatonin secretion which is considered as stimulator system to regulate the rhythm of wake-sleep.Major depression and anxiety, when accumulating and occurring together, can not only perturb the circadian rhythm, which leads to insomnia, but also in some extreme situations as observed, can engender behavior and personality disorders that in some cases lead to suicide.Concerning the treatments in some cases in which the parents in major depression are suffering from the death of children, in parallel of pharmacotherapy, or other family care and treatments, the author proposed \"Child Replacement\" plan in period of mourning.Among the various drugs effective for treatment of insomnia we indicate: Agomelatine-Mianserine-Amitriptyline-Doxepin-Fluoxetine, well interesting to be noted.",

      "title": "GANGGUAN CEMAS PADA LANSIA : SEBUAH LAPORAN KASUS",
      "abstract": "All humans will undergo aging, which has significant impacts both physically and mentally. Anxiety disorders are psychiatric disorders commonly encountered in the elderly and correlate with increased health burden, morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. The elderly with cardiovascular and multimorbid diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This disorder can be a continuation of previous occurrences or a first-time event. The interaction between neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors triggers the onset of this disorder. Diagnosis enforcement is often challenging due to comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression or cognitive disorders, as well as the similarity of anxiety symptoms to symptoms caused by other medical conditions or aging. The elderly find it difficult to accurately describe and identify anxiety. Expertise is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, this disorder often does not receive proper treatment, even though optimal management is crucial to improving outcomes and achieving optimal quality of life in the elderly. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches require special attention due to the impact of aging on organ function. ABSTRAKSemua manusia akan mengalami penuaan yang memiliki dampak signifikan baik secara fisik maupun mental. Gangguan cemas merupakan gangguan psikiatri yang sering dijumpai pada lansia, dan berkorelasi dengan peningkatan beban kesehatan, morbiditas, mortalitas dan kualitas hidup yang buruk. Lansia yang menderita penyakit kardiovaskular dan multimorbitas memiliki risiko yang lebih tinggi untuk mengalami gangguan cemas. Gangguan ini dapat merupakan kelanjutan terhadap kejadian sebelumnya atau sebagai kejadian pertama. Adanya interaksi antara faktor neurobiologi, psikologis dan lingkungan memicu timbulnya gangguan ini. Penegakan diagnosis seringkali menantang, karena berkomorbid dengan gangguan psikiatri lainnya seperti depresi atau gangguan kongnitif, serta adanya kemiripin gejala cemas dengan gejala akibat kondisi medis lain, atau akibat penuaan. Lansia sulit untuk mendeskripsikan dan mengidentifikasi cemas secara akurat. Perlu keahlian dalam menegakan diagnosis yang akurat. Sayangnya, gangguan ini sering kali belum mendapatkan penanganan yang baik, padahal tatalaksana optimal penting untuk meningkatkan luaran dan mencapai kualitas hidup yang optimal pada lansia. Pendekatan farmakoterapi membutuhkan perhatian khusus sebagai dampak penuaan pada fungsi organ tubuh.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The dissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior. Objectives We present the case of a 22-year-old patient, who has been following up for just over a year. The patient refers that two people inhabit her body, talk to each other, exchange opinions and both have control over the body, one giving the turn to the other depending on the circumstances. To this is added delusional symptoms of grandeur and sensorial-perceptual symptoms. In turn, depressive symptoms have appeared that have led the patient to have several suicide attempts throughout the follow-up time. Methods During this time, the patient has required hospital admission on two occasions due to the autolytic ideation. Treatment with neuroleptics and antidepressants has been established that have helped control delusions and thoughts of death, but not the dissociative clinic. Results Dissociative Identity disorder 300.14 (F44.81) Conclusions The different symptoms presented by the patient, as well as the social and occupational deterioration that he presents, make this an extremely complicated case, both in diagnosis and in treatment. Dissociative identity disorder has been very controversial, changing its diagnostic criteria over time. More studies are needed and perhaps future research can give us more clues about this disorder.

      "title": "Complex regional pain syndrome–up-to-date",
      "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) was described for the first time in the 19th century by Silas Weir Mitchell. After the exclusion of other causes, CRPS is characterised by a typical clinical constellation of pain, sensory, autonomic, motor, or trophic symptoms which can no longer be explained by the initial trauma. These symptoms spread distally and are not limited to innervation territories. If CRPS is not improved in the acute phase and becomes chronic, the visible symptoms change throughout because of the changing pathophysiology; the pain, however, remains. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although in complex cases further technical examination mainly for exclusion of alternative diagnoses is warranted. In the initial phase, the pathophysiology is dominated by a posttraumatic inflammatory reaction by the activation of the innate and adaptive immune system. In particular, without adequate treatment, central nociceptive sensitization, reorganisation, and implicit learning processes develop, whereas the inflammation moderates. The main symptoms then include movement disorders, alternating skin temperature, sensory loss, hyperalgesia, and body perception disturbances. Psychological factors such as posttraumatic stress or pain-related fear may impact the course and the treatability of CRPS. The treatment should be ideally adjusted to the pathophysiology. Pharmacological treatment maybe particularly effective in acute stages and includes steroids, bisphosphonates, and dimethylsulfoxide cream. Common anti-neuropathic pain drugs can be recommended empirically. Intravenous long-term ketamine administration has shown efficacy in randomised controlled trials, but its repeated application is demanding and has side effects. Important components of the treatment include physio- and occupational therapy including behavioural therapy (eg, graded exposure in vivo and graded motor imaging). If psychosocial comorbidities exist, patients should be appropriately treated and supported. Invasive methods should only be used in specialised centres and in carefully evaluated cases. Considering these fundamentals, CRPS often remains a chronic pain disorder but the devastating cases should become rare.",

A wide range of sporting activities exist where serious injury and death are potential outcomes with risks varying depending on the nature of the underlying activities. The possibility of unexpected collapse and death from occult or diagnosed/treated medical conditions also exists with, for example, exercise adding additional stress to certain cardiovascular conditions provoking lethal arrhythmias. Drug screening should be undertaken at autopsy in deaths related to sports as stimulants such as amphetamines that may have been taken to enhance performance may also have had a cardiotoxic effect. Genetic screening will also be required in certain cases.",
